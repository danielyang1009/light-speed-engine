### Author
- Wallace P. Mors
### Abstract
In a review of Gerstenberg's Financial Organization and Management of Business in the March, 1952, issue of this Journal, it was stated on page 53 that the posthumous revision was carried out by his wife. This was an error. The revision was carried out by Miss Lillian Doris of the Prentice‐Hall, Inc., organization. The reviewer regrets this error.
