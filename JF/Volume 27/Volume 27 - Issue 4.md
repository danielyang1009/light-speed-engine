## 21. A CORRECTION TO “AN INTER‐TEMPORAL APPROACH TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF DIVIDEND POLICY WITH PRE‐DETERMINED INVESTMENTS,” BUCKNER A. WALLINGFORD, II
### Date

### Author
### Abstract
In reviewing my recent paper, “An Inter‐Temporal Approach to the Optimization of Dividend Policy with Pre‐Determined Investments,” which appeared in the June 1972 issue of this journal, one of my students1
1. I am deeply indebted to Mr. Richard Chu for his careful scrutiny of my paper which resulted in the discovery of the error.

discovered an error in my solution to the differential equation (13). Although the correct solution to this equation yields ambiguous results, a slight modification in the specification of the model yields results which are similar to those found in the original paper.
The problem is modified by introducing the possibility of underpricing new stock issues by a constant percentage below the prevailing market price and investigating the dividend behavior as the underpricing percentage is reduced to zero. If
(
1
−
k
)
is defined as the underpricing percentage, we can redefine equation (4) as
D

=

Aoe

p

where
o
⩽
k
⩽

We will examine the behavior of dividend policy as
k
→

. A new differential equation in p(t) and
p

(

results:

Solving for p(t) yields:

Optimizing p(o) with respect to N(t) yields2
2. Note that at
k
=
1
, N(o) becomes infinite and
p
(
o
)
=
0
. Although this result is troublesome, an investigation of the total value of the firm [N(o)p(o)] shows that this is defined and finite in the limit and that dividend policy is also defined in the limit.

Which yields an approximate payout ratio of:

When

Which is similar to that obtained in the original paper with implications similar to those described in the original paper.
