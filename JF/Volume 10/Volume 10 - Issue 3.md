## 18. A CORRECTION
### Date
- September 1955
### Author
### Abstract
In a review by Clay J. Anderson of Earl C. Hald's Business Cycles, published in the March, 1955, issue of the Journal, the statement was made (p. 97) : “Actually, however, government purchases of goods and services dropped from an annual rate of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 1937 to $3 billion in the third quarter.” The sentence should have read: “Actually, however, government purchases of goods and services dropped from an annual rate of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 1937 to $.3 billion in the third quarter.” The editors regret this error.
