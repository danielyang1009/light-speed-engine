## 3. CAPITAL ASSET PRICES: A THEORY OF MARKET EQUILIBRIUM UNDER CONDITIONS OF RISK*
### Date

### Abstract
I. Introduction
One of the problems which has plagued those attempting to predict the behavior of capital markets is the absence of a body of positive microeconomic theory dealing with conditions of risk. Although many useful insights can be obtained from the traditional models of investment under conditions of certainty, the pervasive influence of risk in financial transactions has forced those working in this area to adopt models of price behavior which are little more than assertions. A typical classroom explanation of the determination of capital asset prices, for example, usually begins with a careful and relatively rigorous description of the process through which individual preferences and physical relationships interact to determine an equilibrium pure interest rate. This is generally followed by the assertion that somehow a market risk‐premium is also determined, with the prices of assets adjusting accordingly to account for differences in their risk.
A useful representation of the view of the capital market implied in such discussions is illustrated in Figure 1. In equilibrium, capital asset prices have adjusted so that the investor, if he follows rational procedures (primarily diversification), is able to attain any desired point along a capital market line.1
1 Although some discussions are also consistent with a non‐linear (but monotonic) curve.

He may obtain a higher expected rate of return on his holdings only by incurring additional risk. In effect, the market presents him with two prices: the price of time, or the pure interest rate (shown by the intersection of the line with the horizontal axis) and the price of risk, the additional expected return per unit of risk borne (the reciprocal of the slope of the line).
At present there is no theory describing the manner in which the price of risk results from the basic influences of investor preferences, the physical attributes of capital assets, etc. Moreover, lacking such a theory, it is difficult to give any real meaning to the relationship between the price of a single asset and its risk. Through diversification, some of the risk inherent in an asset can be avoided so that its total risk is obviously not the relevant influence on its price; unfortunately little has been said concerning the particular risk component which is relevant.

In the last ten years a number of economists have developed normative models dealing with asset choice under conditions of risk. Markowltz,2
2 Harry M. Markowitz, Portfolio Selection, Efficient Diversification of Investments (New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1959). The major elements of the theory first appeared in his article “Portfolio Selection,” The Journal of Finance, XII (March 1952), 77–91.

following Von Neumann and Morgenstern, developed an analysis based on the expected utility maxim and proposed a general solution for the portfolio selection problem. Tobin3
3 James Tobin, “Liquidity Preference as Behavior Towards Risk,” The Review of Economic Studies, XXV (February, 1958), 65–86.

showed that under certain conditions Markowitz's model implies that the process of investment choice can be broken down into two phases: first, the choice of a unique optimum combination of risky assets; and second, a separate choice concerning the allocation of funds between such a combination and a single riskless asset. Recently, Hicks4
4 John R. Hicks, “Liquidity,” The Economic Journal, LXXII (December, 1962), 787–802.

has used a model similar to that proposed by Tobin to derive corresponding conclusions about individual investor behavior, dealing somewhat more explicitly with the nature of the conditions under which the process of investment choice can be dichotomized. An even more detailed discussion of this process, including a rigorous proof in the context of a choice among lotteries has been presented by Gordon and Gangolli.5
5 M. J. Gordon and Ramesh Gangolli, “Choice Among and Scale of Play on Lottery Type Alternatives,” College of Business Administration, University of Rochester, 1962. For another discussion of this relationship see W. F. Sharpe, “A Simplified Model for Portfolio Analysis,” Management Science, Vol. 9, No. 2 (January 1963), 277–293. A related discussion can be found in F. Modigliani and M. H. Miller, “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and the Theory of Investment,” The American Economic Review, XLVIII (June 1958), 261–297.

Although all the authors cited use virtually the same model of investor behavior,6
6 Recently Hirshleifer has suggested that the mean‐variance approach used in the articles cited is best regarded as a special case of a more general formulation due to Arrow. See Hirshleifer's “Investment Decision Under Uncertainty,” Papers and Proceedings of the Seventy‐Sixth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, Dec. 1963, or Arrow's “Le Role des Valeurs Boursieres pour la Repartition la Meilleure des Risques,” International Colloquium on Econometrics, 1952.

none has yet attempted to extend it to construct a market equilibrium theory of asset prices under conditions of risk.7
7 After preparing this paper the author learned that Mr. Jack L. Treynor, of Arthur D. Little, Inc., had independently developed a model similar in many respects to the one described here. Unfortunately Mr. Treynor's excellent work on this subject is, at present, unpublished.

We will show that such an extension provides a theory with implications consistent with the assertions of traditional financial theory described above. Moreover, it sheds considerable light on the relationship between the price of an asset and the various components of its overall risk. For these reasons it warrants consideration as a model of the determination of capital asset prices.
Part II provides the model of individual investor behavior under conditions of risk. In Part III the equilibrium conditions for the capital market are considered and the capital market line derived. The implications for the relationship between the prices of individual capital assets and the various components of risk are described in Part IV.
