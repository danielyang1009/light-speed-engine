### Date

### Abstract
Summary. The modern theory of finance suggests that most investors should put part or all of their money into a “market portfolio” mixed with borrowing or lending. Empirical evidence generally supports the theory, but there are some unanswered questions about the composition of the best market portfolio, about the apparent attractiveness of low risk stocks relative to high risk stocks, and about ways of minimizing transaction costs. Attempts to create a fund based on these principles and to make it available to a large number of investors have uncovered some important problems. Legal costs due to government regulation, the costs of managing a fund, and especially the costs of selling it are all much higher than one might expect. Despite these problems, efforts to create such funds seem destined for eventual success.

## 15. ON THE PRICING OF CORPORATE DEBT: THE RISK STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES*
### Date
- May 1974
### Author
- Robert C. Merton
### Abstract
I. Introduction
The value of a particular issue of corporate debt depends essentially on three items: (1) the required rate of return on riskless (in terms of default) debt (e.g., government bonds or very high grade corporate bonds); (2) the various provisions and restrictions contained in the indenture (e.g., maturity date, coupon rate, call terms, seniority in the event of default, sinking fund, etc.); (3) the probability that the firm will be unable to satisfy some or all of the indenture requirements (i.e., the probability of default).
While a number of theories and empirical studies has been published on the term structure of interest rates (item 1), there has been no systematic development of a theory for pricing bonds when there is a significant probability of default. The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory which might be called a theory of the risk structure of interest rates. The use of the term “risk” is restricted to the possible gains or losses to bondholders as a result of (unanticipated) changes in the probability of default and does not include the gains or losses inherent to all bonds caused by (unanticipated) changes in interest rates in general. Throughout most of the analysis, a given term structure is assumed and hence, the price differentials among bonds will be solely caused by differences in the probability of default.
In a seminal paper, Black and Scholes 1 present a complete general equilibrium theory of option pricing which is particularly attractive because the final formula is a function of “observable” variables. Therefore, the model is subject to direct empirical tests which they 2 performed with some success. Merton 5 clarified and extended the Black‐Scholes model. While options are highly specialized and relatively unimportant financial instruments, both Black and Scholes 1 and Merton 5, 6 recognized that the same basic approach could be applied in developing a pricing theory for corporate liabilities in general.
In Section II of the paper, the basic equation for the pricing of financial instruments is developed along Black‐Scholes lines. In Section III, the model is applied to the simplest form of corporate debt, the discount bond where no coupon payments are made, and a formula for computing the risk structure of interest rates is presented. In Section IV, comparative statics are used to develop graphs of the risk structure, and the question of whether the term premium is an adequate measure of the risk of a bond is answered. In Section V, the validity in the presence of bankruptcy of the famous Modigliani‐Miller theorem 7 is proven, and the required return on debt as a function of the debt‐to‐equity ratio is deduced. In Section VI, the analysis is extended to include coupon and callable bonds.
