### Abstract:
Mainstream queueing models are frequently employed in modeling healthcare delivery in a number of settings, and they further are used in making operational decisions for the same. The vast majority of these queueing models ignore the effects of delay experienced by a patient awaiting care. However, long delays may have adverse effects on patient outcomes and can potentially lead to a longer length of stay (LOS) when the patient ultimately does receive care. This work sets out to understand these delay issues from an operational perspective. Using data of more than 57,000 emergency department (ED) visits, we use an instrumental variable approach to empirically measure the impact of delays in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, i.e., ED boarding, on the patient’s ICU LOS for multiple patient types. Capturing these empirically observed effects in a queueing model is challenging because the effect introduces potentially long-range correlations in service and interarrival times. We propose a queueing model that incorporates these measured delay effects and characterizes approximations to the expected work in the system when the service time of a job is adversely impacted by the delay experienced by that job. Our approximation demonstrates an effect of system load on work that grows much faster than the traditional 1/(1 − ρ) relationship seen in most queueing systems. As such, it is imperative that the relationship of delays and LOS be better understood by hospital managers so that they can make capacity decisions that prevent even seemingly moderate delays from causing dire operational consequences.

## 2. Mixed-Integer Rounding Enhanced Benders Decomposition for Multiclass Service-System Staffing and Scheduling with Arrival Rate Uncertainty

### Abstract:
We study server scheduling in multiclass service systems under uncertainty in the customer arrival volumes. Common practice in such systems is to first identify staffing levels and then determine schedules for the servers that cover these levels. We propose a new stochastic integer programming (SIP) model that integrates these two decisions, which can yield lower scheduling costs by exploiting the presence of alternative server configurations that yield similar quality of service. We find that a branch-and-cut algorithm based on Benders decomposition may fail due to the weakness of the relaxation bound. We propose a novel application of mixed-integer rounding to improve the Benders cuts used in this algorithm, a technique that is applicable to any SIP with integer first-stage decision variables. Numerical examples illustrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach and the potential benefit of solving the integrated model compared to considering the staffing and scheduling problems separately.

## 3. Dynamic Product Rotation in the Presence of Strategic Customers

### Published:
- 31 May 2016
### Abstract:
Dynamic product rotation is perceived as a useful lever to increase sales. The effect over individual customers is, however, unclear: more choice in the future may induce them to postpone a purchase if the current offer is not sufficiently appealing, hoping to buy a better product in the future; moreover, visiting a store to learn about a new product may be costly, thereby diminishing the value of product updates. We analyze a model of strategic customer behavior in the face of a rotating product offering, with variable assortment depth. We find that the customers’ visit and purchase decisions follow a relatively simple structure: a customer should visit the store only when new products have been introduced and purchase a product if the value it provides is higher than a threshold. We then use this structure to examine the retailer’s optimal product-rotation policy. The structure of the optimal policy depends on product-rotation costs and capacity constraints. When capacity constraints are tight, the retailer spreads out product introductions throughout the selling season. Strategic customers tend to become more demanding (their purchasing thresholds increase) as the frequency of product rotation increases, so the marginal benefit of each additional product rotation decreases. In contrast, the purchasing thresholds for myopic customers—who buy the first item that fits their needs—are independent of the number of products introduced in the season. As a result, when the cost of product rotation is low, the frequency of product updates is higher when the retailer sells to strategic customers, whereas the opposite is true when the cost of product rotation is high. When capacity constraints are less stringent and product-rotation costs are convex in the assortment depth, we find that the level of product variety should increase as the season progresses when the firm sells to strategic customers, while the level of product variety stays constant over the season when faced with myopic customers. Finally, when there are no capacity constraints, it is optimal to introduce all products in a single period.

## 4. Higher Prices for Larger Quantities? Nonmonotonic Price–Quantity Relations in B2B Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We study a microprocessor company selling short-life-cycle products to a set of buyers that includes large consumer electronic goods manufacturers. The seller has a limited capacity for each product and negotiates with each buyer for the price. Our analysis of their sales data reveals that larger purchases do not always result in bigger discounts. Instead, the discount curve is like an “N.” While existing theories cannot explain this nonmonotonic pattern, we develop an analytical model and show that the nonmonotonicity is rooted in how sellers value capacity when negotiating with a buyer. Large buyers accelerate the selling process and small buyers are helpful in consuming the residual capacity. However, satisfying midsized buyers may be costly because supplying these buyers can make it difficult to utilize the remaining capacity, which is often too much for small buyers but not enough for large buyers. We briefly discuss the implications for capacity rationing and posted pricing as well as potential applications to other industries.

## 5. When Friends Become Competitors: The Design of Resource Exchange Alliances
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 May 2016
### Abstract:
Many carriers, such as airlines and ocean carriers, collaborate through the formation of alliances. The rules of alliances are important for both the stability of the alliance and the profitability of the alliance members. In this paper, we address the design of resource exchange alliances, a type of alliance agreement widely used in practice, especially in the ocean cargo industry. Resource exchange alliances often increase competition among alliance members since the members can sell substitutable products after the exchange. We propose a resource exchange model that takes into account the resulting competition and alliance profit allocation among alliance members. The problem of determining the optimal amounts of resources to exchange is formulated as a stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs). Although MPEC problems are, in general, very difficult to solve, we successfully demonstrate an efficient solution approach and provide valuable insights for the resource exchange design problem. In particular, we show that the resource exchange alliance we propose can induce greater profit for the alliance members (both total and individual profits) even though it leads to greater competition.

## 6. Redesigning Benders Decomposition for Large-Scale Facility Location

### Published:
- 20 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
The uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem is one of the most famous and most studied problems in the operations research literature. Given a set of potential facility locations and a set of customers, the goal is to find a subset of facility locations to open and to allocate each customer to open facilities so that the facility opening plus customer allocation costs are minimized. In our setting, for each customer the allocation cost is assumed to be a linear or separable convex quadratic function. Motivated by recent UFL applications in business analytics, we revise approaches that work on a projected decision space and hence are intrinsically more scalable for large-scale input data. Our working hypothesis is that many of the exact (decomposition) approaches that were proposed decades ago and discarded soon after need to be redesigned to take advantage of the new hardware and software technologies. To this end, we “thin out” the classical models from the literature and use (generalized) Benders cuts to replace a huge number of allocation variables by a small number of continuous variables that model the customer allocation cost directly. Our results show that Benders decomposition allows for a significant boost in the performance of a mixed-integer programming solver. We report the optimal solution of a large set of previously unsolved benchmark instances widely used in the available literature. In particular, dramatic speedups are achieved for UFL problems with separable quadratic allocation costs, which turn out to be much easier than their linear counterparts when our approach is used.

## 7. Costly Control: An Examination of the Trade-off Between Control Investments and Residual Risk in Interfirm Transactions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 May 2016
### Abstract:
Transaction cost economics predicts that investments in management control will enable risky interfirm transactions. Risk is rarely eliminated, because firms trade off costs of management control and expected costs of control loss (together, the “cost of control”). The resultant solution typically comprises a mix of control investments with residual performance and residual relational risks. Transaction cost economics also predicts that the control-residual risk trade-off will vary with the cost of control. We use survey data on 287 risky information technology transactions to test whether the control-residual risk trade-off varies predictably with two partnership-specific factors that proxy for variation in the cost of control: prior ties between exchange partners and the criticality of strategic resources to the transaction. The results support the hypotheses, providing novel evidence on trade-offs that managers make when investing in management controls while also prudently accepting some risks.

## 8. Delegated Bidding and the Allocative Effect of Accounting Rules
### Author(s):
- Iván Marinovic
### Published:
- 15 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
This paper studies the efficiency and distributive effects of three prominent accounting methods in auction settings when bidders’ incentives are linked to accounting income. The purchase price method (PP) requires the acquirer to book the acquisition at historical cost, thereby underestimating the asset value by the amount of the acquirer’s surplus in the transaction. The exit value method (EV) is downward biased and forces the acquirer to book an accounting loss on the date of acquisition. EV connects otherwise independent valuations inducing a reporting-based winner’s curse and can even lead to fire-sale-like values. Relative to PP, EV implies lower asset prices, a decrease (increase) in the surplus of the seller (acquirer), and an increase in the probability that the asset attains its best use when the market is sufficiently competitive. Finally, I examine an alternative method in which the asset is valued at its perceived value-in-use (VU). Under this method, the acquirer bids more aggressively to increase perceived value-in-use, leading to a shift of surplus from the acquirer to the seller. Yet VU is unbiased and always maximizes the probability that the asset attains its best use.

### Published:
- 20 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
This paper studies the role of consistency as a signaling device. We propose a two-period model that highlights the informativeness of consistency as a signal of skills and allows for the analysis of consequences for behavior. In a simple principal–agent experiment, we test the basic intuition of the model. We show that consistency is indeed associated with skills. Consequently, consistency is valued by others, inducing people to act consistently.

## 10. The International Diversification of Banks and the Value of Their Cross-Border M&A Advice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Apr 2016
### Abstract:
We examine the impact of the international diversification of banks on the value of their advice in 1,705 cross-border merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions. We find that bidders engaging internationally diversified advisors face lower announcement returns. An increase of one standard deviation in advisor diversification is associated with an announcement return lower by 92 basis points for a bidder acquiring a listed target. The lower bidder returns are attributable to the lower synergies of the deals being completed. Our evidence suggests that internationally diversified advisors offer lower-quality advice to their clients, since their reputational concerns are weakened by having access to multiple geographies from which they can derive fee-based income. We present further evidence that financial incentives in the form of the advisor’s involvement in deal financing and market incentives in the form of the potential to gain market share in the bidder country may mitigate some of the negative effects of the international diversification of the advisors.

## 11. Return Smoothing, Liquidity Costs, and Investor Flows: Evidence from a Separate Account Platform
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 29 Apr 2016
### Abstract:
We use a new hedge fund data set from a separate account platform to examine (1) how much of hedge fund return smoothing is due to main fund–specific factors, such as managerial reporting discretion and (2) the costs of removing hedge fund share restrictions. These accounts trade pari passu with matching hedge funds but feature third-party reporting and permissive share restrictions. We use these properties to estimate that 33% of reported smoothing is due to managerial reporting methods. The platform’s fund-level liquidity is associated with a 1.7% performance reduction on an annual basis. Investor flows chase monthly past performance on the platform but not in the associated funds.

## 12. Do Unions Affect Innovation?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 May 2016
### Abstract:
We examine the effect of unionization on firm innovation, using a regression discontinuity design that relies on “locally” exogenous variation generated by elections that pass or fail by a small margin of votes. Passing a union election results in an 8.7% (12.5%) decline in patent quantity (quality) three years after the election. A reduction in R&D expenditures, reduced productivity of inventors, and departures of innovative inventors appear to be plausible underlying mechanisms through which unionization impedes firm innovation. In response to unionization, firms move their innovation activities away from states where union elections win. Our paper provides new insights into the real effects of unionization.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Apr 2016
### Abstract:
We study experimental coordination games to examine through which transmission channels and under which information conditions a panic-based depositor run at one bank may trigger a panic-based depositor run at another bank. We find that withdrawals at one bank trigger withdrawals at another bank by increasing players’ beliefs that other depositors in their own bank will withdraw, making them more likely to withdraw as well. Observed withdrawals only affect depositors’ beliefs, and are thus contagious when they form an informative signal about bank fundamentals.

## 14. Internationalization and Bank Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 May 2016
### Abstract:
This paper documents a positive relation between internationalization and bank risk. This is consistent with the empirical dominance of the market risk hypothesis, whereby internationalization increases banks’ risk due to market-specific factors in foreign markets, over the diversification hypothesis, whereby internationalization allows banks to reduce risk through diversification of their operations. The results continue to hold following a variety of robustness tests, including those for endogeneity and sample selection bias. We also find that the magnitude of this effect is more pronounced during financial crises. The results appear to be at least partially explained by agency problems related to poor corporate governance.

## 15. FORE! An Analysis of CEO Shirking
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
Using golf play as a measure of leisure, we provide direct evidence that some CEOs shirk their responsibilities to the detriment of firm shareholders. CEOs with lower equity-based incentives play more golf and those that golf the most are associated with firms that have lower operating performance and firm values. Numerous tests accounting for the possible endogenous nature of these relations support a conclusion that CEO shirking causes lower firm performance. New CEOs and those at firms with more independent boards are more likely to be replaced when they shirk, but those with long tenures or less independent boards appear to avoid discipline.

## 16. Superreplication of Financial Derivatives via Convex Programming
### Author(s):
- Nabil Kahalé
### Published:
- 20 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
We give a method based on convex programming to calculate the optimal superreplicating and subreplicating prices and corresponding hedging portfolios of a financial derivative in terms of other financial derivatives in a discrete-time setting. Our method produces a model that matches the superreplicating (or subreplicating) price within an arbitrary precision and is consistent with the other financial derivatives prices. Applications include robust replication in terms of call prices with various strikes and maturities of forward start options, volatility and variance swaps and derivatives, cliquet calls, barrier options, and lookback and Asian options. Numerical examples show that, in some cases, the best superreplicating and/or subreplicating prices are within 10% of the price obtained by a standard model but considerably differ from it in other cases. Our method can incorporate bid-ask spreads, interest rates and dividends, and various limitations to the diffusion model.

## 17. Extrapolative Beliefs in Perceptual and Economic Decisions: Evidence of a Common Mechanism
### Author(s):
- Cary Frydman
- Gideon Nave
### Published:
- 30 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
A critical component of both economic and perceptual decision making under uncertainty is the belief-formation process. However, most research has studied belief formation in economic and perceptual decision making in isolation. One reason for this separate treatment may be the assumption that there are distinct psychological mechanisms that underlie belief formation in economic and perceptual decisions. An alternative theory is that there exists a common mechanism that governs belief formation in both domains. Here, we test this alternative theory by combining a novel computational modeling technique with two well-known experimental paradigms. We estimate a drift-diffusion model (DDM) and provide an analytical method to decode prior beliefs from DDM parameters. Subjects in our experiment exhibit strong extrapolative beliefs in both paradigms. In line with the common mechanism hypothesis, we find that a single computational model explains belief formation in both tasks and that individual differences in belief formation are correlated across tasks.

## 18. How Targeting Affects Customer Search: A Field Experiment
### Author(s):
- Nathan M. Fong
### Published:
- 31 May 2016
### Abstract:
It has become common practice for retailers to personalize direct marketing efforts based on customer transaction histories as a tactic to increase sales. Targeted email offers featuring products in the same category as a customer’s previous purchases generate higher purchase rates. However, a targeted offer emphasizing familiar products could result in curtailed search for unadvertised products, as a closely matched offer weakens a customer’s incentives to search beyond the targeted items. In a field experiment using email offers sent by an online wine retailer, targeted offers resulted in decreased search activity on the retailer’s website. This effect is driven by a lower rate of search by customers who visit the site, rather than a lower incidence of search. There are several ways this could potentially hurt retailers and consumers, such as reduced cross-selling and fewer opportunities for customers to explore new products.

## 19. Behavior-Based Pricing, Production Efficiency, and Quality Differentiation
### Author(s):
- Bing Jing
### Published:
- 30 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
In a two-period vertical duopoly, we examine how behavior-based price discrimination (BPD) affects the firms’ endogenous quality differentiation and profits. The firms’ relative production efficiency, defined as the ratio between their unit cost difference and quality difference, plays a crucial role. With exogenous product qualities, BPD always decreases the profits of the more efficient firm, but increases those of the sufficiently less efficient firm. Anticipating its period 2 disadvantage in price discrimination, the less efficient firm competes more vigorously and also gains more in period 1 than its competitor. For the sufficiently less efficient firm, its period 1 gain dominates its period 2 loss, and its total profits increase. With endogenous quality choices, BPD does not alter the low-end quality (at the lower bound of the quality space), but increases the high-end quality, enlarging quality differentiation. This is because under BPD, each firm’s profit gain decreases (or its profit loss increases) in its relative production efficiency. Interestingly, BPD may increase both firms’ profits under endogenous quality differentiation. Aside from causing mismatch between consumers and products, we further show that BPD lowers social welfare through inducing excessive quality differentiation.

## 20. Trading Time in a Congested Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 May 2016
### Abstract:
The first in, first out (FIFO) queue discipline respects the order of arrivals, but is not efficient when customers have heterogeneous waiting costs. Priority queues, in which customers with higher waiting costs are served first, are more efficient but usually involve undesirable queue-jumping behaviors that violate bumped customers’ property rights over their waiting spots. To have the best of both worlds, we propose time-trading mechanisms, in which customers who are privately informed about their waiting costs mutually agree on the ordering in the queue by trading positions. If a customer ever moves back in the queue, she will receive an appropriate monetary compensation. Customers can always decide not to participate in trading and retain their positions as if they are being served FIFO. We design the optimal mechanisms for the social planner, the service provider, and an intermediary who might mediate the trading platform. Both the social planner’s and the service provider’s optimal mechanisms involve a flat admission fee and an auction that implements strict priority. If a revenue-maximizing intermediary operates the trading platform, it should charge a trade participation fee and implement an auction with some trade restrictions. Therefore, customers are not strictly prioritized. However, relative to a FIFO system, the intermediary delivers value to the social planner by improving efficiency, and to the service provider by increasing its revenue.
