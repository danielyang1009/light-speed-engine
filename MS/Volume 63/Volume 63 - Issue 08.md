### Abstract:
We study sourcing in a supply chain with three levels: a manufacturer, tier 1 suppliers, and tier 2 suppliers prone to disruption from, e.g., natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods. The manufacturer may not directly dictate which tier 2 suppliers are used but may influence the sourcing decisions of tier 1 suppliers via contract parameters. The manufacturer’s optimal strategy depends critically on the degree of overlap in the supply chain: if tier 1 suppliers share tier 2 suppliers, resulting in a “diamond-shaped” supply chain, the manufacturer relies less on direct mitigation (procuring excess inventory and multisourcing in tier 1) and more on indirect mitigation (inducing tier 1 suppliers to mitigate disruption risk). We also show that while the manufacturer always prefers less overlap, tier 1 suppliers may prefer a more overlapped supply chain and hence may strategically choose to form a diamond-shaped supply chain. This preference conflict worsens as the manufacturer’s profit margin increases, as disruptions become more severe, and as unreliable tier 2 suppliers become more heterogeneous in their probability of disruption; however, penalty contracts—in which the manufacturer penalizes tier 1 suppliers for a failure to deliver ordered units—alleviate this coordination problem.

## 2. Corporate Finance Policies and Social Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 May 2016
### Abstract:
This paper shows that managers are influenced by their social peers when making corporate policy decisions. Using biographical information about executives and directors of U.S. public companies, we define social ties from current and past employment, education, and other activities. We find that more connections two companies share with each other, more similar their capital investments are. To address endogeneity concerns, we find that companies invest less similarly when an individual connecting them dies. The results extend to other corporate finance policies. Furthermore, central companies in the social network invest in a less idiosyncratic way and exhibit better economic performance.

### Abstract:
While there is overwhelming support for the negative consequences of product recalls, empirical evidence of operational drivers of recalls is almost nonexistent. In this study, we identify product variety (measured as the number of factory installed options), plant variety (measured as the number of models per assembly line in a plant), and capacity utilization as drivers of subsequent manufacturing-related recalls. We examine their individual and joint effects using a unique data set compiled for a seven-year period by linking assembly line production data for North American automotive manufacturers with recall data from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. We show that manufacturing-related recalls are positively associated with product variety and plant utilization, but not with plant variety. We also find that the joint effect of plant variety and utilization is positively associated with increased recalls. In quantitative terms, a one-standard-deviation increase in the number of options (four additional options) is associated with two additional recalls and costs $46.2 million to automakers over the sample duration. We observe similar results with plant utilization, and find that a car built in a plant that is being utilized above 100% capacity is associated with more than eight additional recalls corresponding to an incremental cost of $167 million.

## 4. Supplier Competition and Cost Improvement
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
Buyers have two levers to enhance their supply base performance: fostering supplier competition and inducing suppliers to improve. The competition–improvement relation between the two levers has important implications for supply base design. We study a buyer facing two potential suppliers that can exert cost-reduction efforts, examining the interplay of supplier competition and supplier cost improvement under various information structures (i.e., the supplier effort is observable or unobservable) and commitment capabilities (i.e., the buyer may not commit, or may commit to a full or partial procurement mechanism, before suppliers exert efforts). We find that the two identical suppliers may choose unequal efforts, resulting in an asymmetric equilibrium outcome that enhances the performance of dual sourcing. Moreover, the competition–improvement relation depends on the effort observability. Whereas supplier competition always leads to lower improvement effort when the effort is unobservable, it may induce higher effort when the effort is observable. Thus, a trade-off between supplier competition and supplier effort is not always necessary in supply base design. Comparing the observable- and unobservable-effort cases, we demonstrate a detrimental effect of supplier effort observability on the buyer profits. Finally, we show that more commitment expands the presence of asymmetric equilibria, enhancing dual sourcing, and the partial commitment strengthens the positive effect of competition on observable efforts while maintaining the detrimental effect of effort observability.

## 5. Omnichannel Retail Operations with Buy-Online-and-Pick-up-in-Store
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
Many retailers have recently started to offer customers the option to buy online and pick up in store (BOPS). We study the impact of the BOPS initiative on store operations. We build a stylized model where a retailer operates both online and offline channels. Customers strategically make channel choices. The BOPS option affects customer choice in two ways: by providing real-time information about inventory availability and by reducing the hassle cost of shopping. We obtain three findings. First, not all products are well suited for in-store pickup; specifically, it may not be profitable to implement BOPS on products that sell well in stores. Second, BOPS enables retailers to reach new customers, but for existing customers, the shift from online fulfillment to store fulfillment may decrease profit margins when the latter is less cost effective. Finally, in a decentralized retail system where store and online channels are managed separately, BOPS revenue can be shared across channels to alleviate incentive conflicts; it is rarely efficient to allocate all the revenue to a single channel.

### Abstract:
This paper provides an analysis of the impact of new investors on the bubble surrounding the Baosteel call warrant, the first derivative traded in China after a nine-year suspension. We empirically show that new investors initiated the bubble at the opening call auction and were the key driving force to sustain the bubble until the maturity of the warrant.

## 7. Investment Decisions Under Ambiguity: Evidence from Mutual Fund Investor Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 May 2016
### Abstract:
We provide novel evidence on the role of ambiguity aversion in determining the response of mutual fund investors to fund performance. Our analysis is motivated by theoretical models of decision making by ambiguity-averse investors. A key implication of the models is that when investors face information signals of uncertain quality, they place a greater weight on the worst signal. We find strong empirical support for this prediction in the form of heightened sensitivity of investor fund flows to the worst performance measure across multiple horizons. This effect is particularly pronounced for retail funds in contrast to institutional funds.

## 8. What’s Your Identification Strategy? Innovation in Corporate Finance Research

### Published:
- 3 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
We study the diffusion of techniques designed to identify causal relationships in corporate finance research. We estimate that the diffusion started in the mid-1990s, lagged 20 years compared to economics, and is now used in the majority of corporate finance articles. Consistent with recent theories of technology diffusion, the adoption varies across researchers based on individuals’ expected net benefits of adoption. Younger scholars, holders of PhDs in economics, and those working at top institutions adopt faster. Adoption is accelerated through networks of colleagues and alumni and is also facilitated by straddlers who cross over from economics to finance. Our findings highlight new forces that explain the diffusion of innovation and shape the norms of academic research.

## 9. Asset Pricing with Downside Liquidity Risks
### Author(s):
- Sean A. Anthonisz

### Published:
- 31 May 2016
### Abstract:
We develop a parsimonious liquidity-adjusted downside capital asset pricing model to investigate whether phenomena such as downward liquidity spirals and flights to liquidity impact expected asset returns. We find strong empirical support for the model. Downside liquidity risk (sensitivity of stock liquidity to negative market returns) has an economically meaningful return premium that is 10 times larger than its symmetric analogue. The expected liquidity level and downside market risk are also associated with meaningful return premiums. Downside liquidity risk and its associated premium are higher during periods of low marketwide liquidity and for stocks that are relatively small, illiquid, volatile, and have high book-to-market ratios. These results are consistent with investors requiring compensation for holding assets susceptible to adverse liquidity phenomena. Our findings suggest that mitigation of downside liquidity risk can lower firms’ cost of capital.

## 10. Catching Falling Knives: Speculating on Liquidity Shocks
### Author(s):
- Jean-Edouard Colliard
### Published:
- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
Many market participants invest resources to acquire information about liquidity rather than fundamentals. I show that agents using such information can reduce the magnitude of short-lived pricing errors by trading against liquidity shocks. However, the short-run stabilizing effect of this behavior also makes it more difficult to identify liquidity shocks, a signal-jamming effect that slows down price discovery in the long run. As more agents invest in nonfundamental information, market prices become more resilient to liquidity shocks but also recover more slowly from temporary price deviations.

### Published:
- 27 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
This study examines the relation between principles-based standards and earnings attributes. We create a firm-year-specific variable that measures the extent to which firms’ financial reporting is affected by principles-based standards. We find that firms’ earnings are more informative and persistent and have a larger positive association with future cash flows, on average, when firms’ standards are more principles based. We also find evidence that managers use the added discretion provided by principles-based standards to manage earnings when firms are near bankruptcy, issuing equity, or experiencing high growth, and if earnings are near prominent earnings benchmarks. Overall, our evidence is consistent with managers using the discretion provided by principles-based standards to communicate better the economic substance of transactions, on average, but also with some managers using the added discretion strategically when managerial incentives exist to increase reported earnings.

## 12. A Formal Theory of Strategy
### Author(s):
- Eric Van den Steen
### Published:
- 18 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
What makes a decision strategic? When is strategy most important? This paper formally studies these questions, starting from a (functional) definition of strategy as the smallest set of choices to optimally guide (or force) other choices. The paper shows that this definition coincides with the equilibrium outcome of a “strategy formulation game,” in which such strategy endogenously creates a hierarchy among decisions. With respect to what makes a decision strategic and what makes strategy valuable, the paper considers the effect of commitment, reliability, and irreversibility of a decision; the presence of uncertainty (and the type of uncertainty); the number and strength of its interactions and the centrality of a decision; its level and importance; the development of capabilities; and competition.

## 13. Overconfident Competing Newsvendors

### Published:
- 30 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
Overconfidence is one of the most consistent, powerful, and widespread cognitive biases affecting decision making in situations characterized by random outcomes. In this paper, we study the effects and implications of overconfidence in a competitive newsvendor setting. In this context, overconfidence is defined as a cognitive bias in which decision makers behave as though the outcome of an uncertain event is less risky than it really is. This bias unequivocally leads to a lower expected profit for a newsvendor that does not compete on inventory availability. Nevertheless, it can be a positive force for competing newsvendors. Indeed, we find that when the product’s profit margin is high, overconfidence can lead to a first-best outcome. In a similar vein, we also show that the more biased of two competing newsvendors is not necessarily destined to a smaller expected profit than its less biased competitor.

## 14. The First Deal: The Division of Founder Equity in New Ventures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 May 2016
### Abstract:
We examine the trade-off between efficiency and equality within the context of entrepreneurial founding teams. Using a formal theory where founders may have preferences over relative outcomes, we derive predictions about the antecedents and consequences of dividing equity equally among all founders. Using proprietary survey data, we empirically test the predictions. Our central finding is that teams that split equity equally are less likely to raise funds from outside investors. The relationship appears not to be causal, but instead driven by selection effects across heterogeneous teams with varying degrees of inequality aversion.

### Published:
- 18 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
There is an increasing attention in information systems to be able to predict outcomes using search frequency on popular portals. This growing literature focuses on revealing demand patterns of individual assets (e.g., products, stocks, services). However, users typically search many different assets together (e.g., correlated searches) and leave a digital footprint, which can help provide insights on the behaviors of a group of assets. Furthermore, such group behavior can be used to predict outcomes (e.g., demand, stock returns) in the future. We analyze the underlying behavior of distinct subnetworks formed by correlated user searches for multiple items in the stock market and use such information for return prediction. Using cosearch data for stocks from Yahoo! Finance, we find 50–79 search clusters representing 230–349 stocks among Russell 3000 stocks at different time periods. These clusters reveal interesting habitats where the returns of stocks within a cluster tend to comove after controlling for known determinants of comovement. When a stock enters (departs) a cluster, the focal stock return comoves (detaches) with the cluster returns. Thus, search cluster–based habitats reveal aggregate investment preferences and are more granular than fundamental-based habitats. We find that search-based habitats can also improve return predictability of related stocks.

## 16. Do Targeted Discount Offers Serve as Advertising? Evidence from 70 Field Experiments

### Published:
- 24 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
The prevalence and widespread usage of email has given businesses a direct and cost-effective way of providing consumers with targeted discount offers. While these discounts are expected to increase the demand for the promoted products, are they effective in increasing revenues? Do they have effects beyond acting as price reductions? We study these questions using individual-level data from 70 randomized experiments run by a large online ticket resale platform. We estimate the redemption rates of the offers and also measure the broader impact of emailed promotions by comparing purchases by individuals who received the experimental promotions with purchases by those who did not receive the offers because of the experimental randomization. We find that the offers cause the average expenditure to increase significantly, by $3.03 (a 37.2% increase) during the promotion window. However, the redemption rate of these offers is low. Importantly, 90% of these gains are not through redemption of the offers. The individuals who spent more on the platform in the past are more responsive to the offers, and the effect of the offers is significantly higher among individuals who did not transact on the platform in the year before the offer was given. Interestingly, the offer causes carryover to the week after the promotion expires; we find that spending increases by $1.55 in the week after the offer expires. Additionally, we find evidence for cross category spillovers to nonpromoted products: offers not applicable to a ticket genre cause an increase in spending in that genre. We conclude that emailed offers can serve as a form of “advertising” for the firm’s products, in addition to being tools for price discrimination.

## 17. Measuring Multichannel Advertising Response

### Published:
- 8 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
Advances in data collection have made it increasingly easy to collect information on advertising exposures. However, translating this seemingly rich data into measures of advertising response has proven difficult, largely because of concerns that advertisers target customers with a higher propensity to buy or increase advertising during periods of peak demand. We show how this problem can be addressed by studying a setting where a firm randomly held out customers from each campaign, creating a sequence of randomized field experiments that mitigates (many) potential endogeneity problems. Exploratory analysis of individual holdout experiments shows positive effects for both email and catalog; however, the estimated effect for any individual campaign is imprecise, because of the small size of the holdout. To pool data across campaigns, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for advertising response that allows us to account for individual differences in purchase propensity and marketing response. Building on the traditional ad-stock framework, we are able to estimate separate decay rates for each advertising medium, allowing us to predict channel-specific short- and long-term effects of advertising and use these predictions to inform marketing strategy. We find that catalogs have substantially longer-lasting impact on customer purchase than emails. We show how the model can be used to score and target individual customers based on their advertising responsiveness, and we find that targeting the most responsive customers increases the predicted returns on advertising by approximately 70% versus traditional recency, frequency, and monetary value–based targeting.

## 18. Behavior-Based Pricing in Vertically Differentiated Industries
### Author(s):
- Ki-Eun Rhee
- Raphael Thomadsen
### Published:
- 8 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We study behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a vertically differentiated model. Vertical differentiation is innately asymmetric because all customers prefer the higher-quality product when prices are equal. This asymmetry causes BBP to have different properties than symmetric horizontally differentiated models. We highlight two dimensions that affect the analysis: the role of quality-adjusted cost differences between the firms and the role of consumer discounting relative to firm discounting. In the second period, consistent with the prior literature, we find that there are conditions based on market shares and quality-adjusted costs under which either the low-quality firm or the high-quality firm—but not both—will reward its current customers with lower prices than it charges to new customers. We then consider whether these conditions can arise in a two-period equilibrium. We find that if consumers sufficiently discount the future periods, then firms at enough of a competitive disadvantage will reward their customers: i.e., the low-quality firm will reward its current customers if the quality-adjusted cost differential between the two firms is small, while the high-quality firm will reward its current customers if this cost differential is large. Conversely, we find that if consumers do not discount the future very much, then the firm at a competitive disadvantage (i.e., a low-quality firm competing against a low-cost high-quality firm, or a high-quality firm that has very high costs) can earn greater profits with BBP than without BBP, although there are cases where both firms may benefit from BBP.

## 19. Optimal Continuous Pricing with Strategic Consumers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
An important economic problem is that of finding optimal pricing mechanisms to sell a single item when there are a random number of buyers who arrive over time. In this paper, we combine ideas from auction theory and recent work on pricing with strategic consumers to derive the optimal continuous time pricing scheme in this situation. Under the assumption that buyers are split among those who have a high valuation and those who have a low valuation for the item, we obtain the price path that maximizes the seller’s revenue. We conclude that, depending on the specific instance, it is optimal to either use a fixed price strategy or to use steep markdowns by the end of the selling season. As a complement to this optimality result, we prove that under a large family of price functions there is an equilibrium for the buyers. Finally, we derive an approach to tackle the case in which buyers’ valuations follow a general distribution. The approach is based on optimal control theory and is well suited for numerical computations.

## 20. Systemic Influences on Optimal Equity-Credit Investment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
We introduce an equity-credit portfolio framework taking into account the structural interaction of market and credit risk, along with their systemic dependencies. We derive an explicit expression for the optimal investment strategy in stocks and credit default swaps (CDSs). We exploit its representation structure and analyze the mechanisms driving the optimal investment decisions. The transmission of market risk premia is the key mechanism through which systemic influences affect the optimal investment strategy. We develop a novel calibration procedure and find that systemic dependencies are statistically significant when the model is fitted to historical time series of equity and CDS data. An empirical analysis with data of companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 reveals the critical role of systemic risk in portfolio monitoring.
