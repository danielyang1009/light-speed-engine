### Abstract:
There are over 90,000 patients in the United States waiting for a kidney transplant. Under the current allocation policy, the vast majority of deceased organs are allocated locally. This causes significant disparities in waiting times and access to transplant across different geographical areas. To ameliorate this inequity, we propose an operational solution that offers affordable jet services (OrganJet) to patients on the transplant waiting list, allowing them to list in multiple different, and possibly very distant, donation service areas (DSAs) of their choosing. First, using a fluid approximation, we formulate the patients’ problem of choosing a location to multiple list as a selfish routing game in which each patient tries to minimize his “congestion cost,” i.e., maximize his life expectancy. Through a combination of numerical, simulation, and analytical results, we show that multiple listing can lead to a significant improvement in geographic equity. In the special case when sufficiently many patients can multiple list, the geographic inequity disappears. Moreover, the supply of deceased donor organs increases under multiple listing, leading to more transplants and saved lives. We also consider a diffusion approximation and study the resulting multiple-listing game. The equilibrium outcome under the diffusion approximation is a second-order perturbation of that under the selfish routing formulation. In particular, the geographic equity metric, waiting times, and probabilities of receiving a transplant at various DSAs in equilibrium are second-order perturbations of those predicted by the selfish routing equilibrium. Hence, the analysis under the diffusion approximation also supports the finding that multiple listing leads to an improvement in geographic equity. In addition, restricting attention to the special case of sufficiently many patients multiple listing leads to an explicit characterization of the equilibria, which in turn yields additional structural insights. Last, we undertake a simulation study that supports aforementioned findings.

## 3. Sourcing Under Supplier Responsibility Risk: The Effects of Certification, Audit, and Contingency Payment

### Abstract:
Companies that source from emerging economies often face supplier responsibility risks, namely, financial and reputational burdens that the companies have to bear when their suppliers’ engagement in noncomplying labor and environmental practices becomes public. To mitigate such risks, companies can invest in screening mechanisms and design incentive schemes in sourcing contracts. Common mitigation instruments include supplier certification, process audits, and contingency payments. The interactions of these instruments are often not well understood. We first note that the effectiveness of any mitigation instrument depends on how it changes the economic trade-offs faced by a supplier in compliance to social and environmental standard, and hence we develop a model that explicitly captures such trade-offs. As a result, our model endogenizes the supplier’s noncompliance probability and connects it with various factors, including the supplier’s intrinsic ethical level that is unobservable to the buyer. We then study the buyer’s optimal contracting problem under different mitigation instruments. We find that although the process audit and contingency payment instruments can directly lower supplier responsibility risk, they, acting alone, are not as effective as the supplier certification instrument in screening suppliers with different ethical levels. Nevertheless, these instruments are all complementary to each other; when used jointly, they make supplier screening more effective and result in lower sourcing cost. These findings provide explanations for some of the observed practices used in industry to mitigate supplier responsibility risks.

- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We study the effects of the introduction of cross-channel functionalities on the overall sales dispersion of retailers and the implications of these effects for inventory management. To do that, we analyze data from a leading U.S. retailer who introduced a “ship-to-store” (STS) functionality that allows customers to ship products to their local store free of charge when those products are not available in their local store. Based on the fact that stores prioritize carrying products for which local demand is high, we test the hypothesis that introducing the STS functionality increased the retailer’s overall sales dispersion. We find that, on average, the contribution of the 90% lowest-selling products to total sales increased by 0.75 percentage points, increasing sales dispersion. Calibrating conventional inventory-ordering models, we show that to respond optimally to the observed increase in dispersion, the retailer would need to increase its cycle and safety inventories by approximately 2.7%. Our paper points out the effect of an increasingly important retail phenomenon (channel integration) on a key factor for inventory management (sales dispersion).

### Published:
- 26 Aug 2016
### Abstract:
Face-to-face communication drastically increases cooperation rates in social dilemmas. We test which factors are the most important drivers of this communication gap. We distinguish three main categories. First, communication may decrease social distance. Second, communication may enable subjects to assess their opponent’s cooperativeness (“type detection”) and condition their own action on that information. Third, communication allows subjects to make promises, which create commitment for subjects who do not want to break a promise. We find that communication increases cooperation very substantially. In our experiment, we find that commitment value is an important factor, but the largest part of the increase can be attributed to type detection. We do not find evidence that social distance plays a role.

### Published:
- 14 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
Prior literature has documented that investor attention and constraints on that attention are associated with the pricing of stocks. We introduce the concept of attention comovement, which is the extent to which investor attention to a firm is explained by attention paid to the firm’s industry and the market in general. We find that attention comovement is nontrivial for the average firm and is related to firm characteristics, such as size and visibility. We also find that the comovement of investor attention has market consequences, in that it is positively associated with excess stock return comovement. Finally, we show that a firm’s earnings announcement contributes to the transfer of attention from one firm to its peer firms. Our results provide insights about the information flows underlying return comovement and aid in understanding the micro and macronature of investor attention.

## 7. The Interplay Between Forward-Looking Measures and Target Setting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We examine whether financial targets are based on both forward-looking and financial information, rather than on financial information only. We collect sales and performance appraisal data of store managers in a retail chain. The firm issues directives focused on the provision of excellent customer service and assesses store managers’ compliance with these directives subjectively. We demonstrate that, controlling for current sales, compliance with directives scores predicts future sales performance. We find that, next to objective sales information, this forward-looking information is impounded in the next year’s sales target. Finally, we find some evidence that suggests that incorporating forward-looking information improves the accuracy of sales targets.

## 8. Do Gender and Business Trainings Affect Business Outcomes? Experimental Evidence from Vietnam

### Abstract:
We use a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of a business training for female clients of a microfinance institution in northern Vietnam, and we consider the impact on (i) business knowledge, (ii) practices, and (ii) outcomes, as well as (iv) firm entry and exit decisions. In addition, we vary the nature of the intervention by inviting husbands to participate in the trainings for a subsample of our respondents. To gauge both short-term and medium-term effects, we combine data from two separate postintervention surveys. We find evidence of economically substantive impacts on knowledge, practices, and outcomes, and on the extensive margin (entry and exit). We also document that it takes time for the “downstream” outcomes of the trainings to materialize; although we find evidence of medium-term effects, no such evidence exists for the short term. Inviting husbands to participate in the trainings does not affect any of our knowledge or practice measures, but we document weak evidence for differential impact on (agricultural) sales and profits.

## 9. How Much Does Honesty Cost? Small Bonuses Can Motivate Ethical Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
Although people generally try to avoid lying, the lure of potential monetary payoffs often leads to unethical behavior. The current research investigates whether small monetary rewards for honesty help people resist the temptations of larger incentives or whether they backfire and lead to even more dishonesty. Four experiments address these issues. Experiment 1 shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly when they could have lied to obtain $4; an identical bonus, however, did not increase dishonesty. Experiment 2 uses a different context and again shows that a $1 bonus led people to act more honestly; it also finds no evidence that this small payoff crowded out subsequent altruistic behavior. Experiment 3 shows that a $1 bonus increased people’s honesty even when the payoffs for lying increased to $8, $12, and $16, but not when the payoff for lying increased to $20. Experiment 4 finds that smaller bonuses for honesty still had an impact, although it tended to be somewhat weaker. In addition, compared with no bonus, the combined effect of several small monetary bonuses (1 dollar, 75 cents, 50 cents, and 25 cents) marginally reduced lying.

### Abstract:
We study the effects of reminders on people’s behavior in investment activities characterized by up-front costs and delayed benefits, such as getting an education and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We conduct a field experiment and show that simple weekly reminders induce users of a gym to substantially increase their gym attendance over an extensive period. Users’ response to reminders is immediate (within hours) and recurrent for any subsequent reminder, which can be explained by limited attention. We find some evidence of habit formation, leading to more frequent physical activity also after treatment, although with an effect smaller than during treatment. Simple reminders are thus a cost-effective policy tool.

## 11. Between First- and Second-Order Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We develop a continuum of stochastic dominance rules, covering preferences from first- to second-order stochastic dominance. The motivation for such a continuum is that while decision makers have a preference for “more is better,” they are mostly risk averse but cannot assert that they would dislike any risk. For example, situations with targets, aspiration levels, and local convexities in induced utility functions in sequential decision problems may lead to preferences for some risks. We relate our continuum of stochastic dominance rules to utility classes, the corresponding integral conditions, and probability transfers and discuss the usefulness of these interpretations. Several examples involving, e.g., finite-crossing cumulative distribution functions, location-scale families, and induced utility, illustrate the implementation of the framework developed here. Finally, we extend our results to a combined order including convex (risk-taking) stochastic dominance.

## 12. The When and Why of Abandonment: The Role of Organizational Differences In Medical Technology Life Cycles

### Published:
- 11 Aug 2016
### Abstract:
Although the adoption of new technology has received significant attention in management research, investigations of abandonment have lagged. In this study, we examine differences in the rates of abandonment of medical technologies based on whether abandonment occurs in response to the emergence of a superior technology or in light of new information questioning its efficacy. We link differences in responses to underlying differences in the missions and incentives of organizations. Examining coronary stents across three technological regime changes using a census of approximately two million patients admitted to Florida hospitals from 1995 to 2007, we show meaningful differences across three hospital types: for-profit, not-for-profit, and academic medical centers. Results show that for-profit hospitals abandon the earlier generation in favor of a superior technology faster than not-for-profit hospitals, but this is not the case if the efficacy of the technology is questioned. Academic medical centers, however, have the highest rates of abandonment under both triggers. Importantly, we find that organizational factors dominate physician differences as explanatory factors for abandonment. Implications of these findings are twofold. First, we identify the factors likely at play, i.e., the salience of norms of science and the corresponding trade-offs with economic benefits, when organizations make abandonment decisions. Second, our work underscores the importance of organizational mission, which dominates individual preferences in determining rates of abandonment.

## 13. Business Practices in Small Firms in Developing Countries
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
Management has a large effect on the productivity of medium and large firms. But does management matter in micro and small firms, where the majority of the labor force in developing countries works? We develop 26 questions that measure business practices in marketing, stock-keeping, record-keeping, and financial planning. These questions have been administered in surveys in Bangladesh, Chile, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. We show that variation in business practices explains as much of the variation in outcomes—sales, profits, and labor productivity and total factor productivity—in microenterprises as in larger enterprises. Panel data from three countries indicate that better business practices predict higher survival rates and faster sales growth. The association of business practices with firm outcomes is robust to including numerous measures of the owner’s human capital. We find that owners with higher human capital, children of entrepreneurs, and firms with employees employ better business practices.

## 14. Employment Nondiscrimination Acts and Corporate Innovation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Jun 2016
### Abstract:
We show that U.S. state-level employment nondiscrimination acts (ENDAs)—laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity—spur innovation. We find a significant increase in patents and patent citations for firms headquartered in states that have passed ENDAs relative to firms headquartered in states that have not. This result is more pronounced for firms that previously have not implemented pro-gay nondiscrimination policies, for firms in states with a large homosexual population, and for firms in human capital-intensive industries. Lastly, we provide evidence suggesting that ENDAs affect innovation by matching employees, who are generally more creative than anti-gay employees, with innovative firms.

## 15. Firm Rigidities and the Decline in Growth Opportunities
### Author(s):
- Claudio Loderer

- Urs Waelchli
### Published:
- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
As public firms exploit their growth opportunities following their initial public offering, their assets in place increase, and they organize themselves optimally to operate these assets efficiently, which requires a more formal and less flexible organization than to generate new growth opportunities. Our theory predicts that, as a result of these inflexibilities, firms fail to fully replace their growth opportunities, so that their Tobin’s q falls with age and they invest less as they grow older. With our theory, competition in the market for corporate control and capital markets monitoring increase the rate of decrease in Tobin’s q, while product and labor market competition slow it down. We find empirical support for these predictions. We also find evidence that the decline in q is related to firm rigidities.

## 16. Investor Horizon and the Life Cycle of Innovative Firms: Evidence from Venture Capital
### Author(s):
- Jean-Noël Barrot
### Published:
- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
This paper studies whether and how the contractual horizon of venture capital funds affects their investments in innovative firms. I find that funds with a longer remaining horizon select younger companies at an earlier stage of their development, which grow their patent stock significantly more than companies financed by funds with a shorter horizon. The sensitivity of investment decisions to horizon is stronger among experienced venture capital firms, who allocate investments across a larger number of fund vintages. Finally, I find that the interaction of funds’ fixed horizon with their option-like compensation structure affects their investment decisions: when early performance has been high, fund managers target less innovative companies. These findings shed light on the drivers of venture capital investment decisions and on their implications for the type of companies that receive venture capital financing.

## 17. A Corporate Beauty Contest
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We provide new evidence that the subjective “look of competence” rather than beauty is important for CEO selection and compensation. Our experiments, studying the facial traits of CEOs using nearly 2,000 subjects, link facial characteristics to both CEO compensation and performance. In one experiment, we use pairs of photographs and find that subjects rate CEO faces as appearing more “competent” than non-CEO faces. Another experiment matches CEOs from large firms against CEOs from smaller firms and finds large-firm CEOs look more competent. In a third experiment, subjects numerically score the facial traits of CEOs. We find competent looks are priced into CEO compensation, more so than attractiveness. Our evidence suggests this premium has a behavioral origin. First, we find no evidence that the premium is associated with superior performance. Second, we separately analyze inside and outside CEO hires and find that the competence compensation premium is driven by outside hires—the situation where first impressions are likely to be more important.

## 18. Do Stock Options Overcome Managerial Risk Aversion? Evidence from Exercises of Executive Stock Options
### Author(s):
- Randall A. Heron
- Erik Lie
### Published:
- 14 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We report that the probability that executives exercise options early decreases with the volatility of the underlying stock return. We interpret this to mean that executives’ subjective option value increases with volatility and that option grants increase executives’ risk appetite. Further decomposition reveals that the results are most pronounced for idiosyncratic volatility, consistent with our conjecture that executives believe they can better predict or influence the resolution of idiosyncratic uncertainty than systematic uncertainty and, thus, favor the former.

## 19. Tail Risk Dynamics in Stock Returns: Links to the Macroeconomy and Global Markets Connectedness
### Author(s):
- Daniele Massacci
### Published:
- 22 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We propose a new time-varying peaks over threshold model to study tail risk dynamics in equity markets: the laws of motion for the parameters are defined through the score-based approach. We apply the model to daily returns from U.S. size-sorted decile stock portfolios and show that large firms’ tail risk increases during recessions more than small firms’ tail risk. Our results are consistent with the granular hypothesis of aggregate fluctuations, and we quantify the impact of large firms’ tail risk shocks on the economy. A measure of tail connectedness is proposed: evidence from international equity markets shows that tail connectedness increases during periods of turmoil.

### Published:

### Abstract:
We study the impact of network information for social security fraud detection. In a social security system, companies have to pay taxes to the government. This study aims to identify those companies that intentionally go bankrupt to avoid contributing their taxes. We link companies to each other through their shared resources, because some resources are the instigators of fraud. We introduce GOTCHA!, a new approach to define and extract features from a time-weighted network and to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in fraud detection. The GOTCHA! propagation algorithm diffuses fraud through the network, labeling the unknown and anticipating future fraud while simultaneously decaying the importance of past fraud. We find that domain-driven network variables have a significant impact on detecting past and future frauds and improve the baseline by detecting up to 55% additional fraudsters over time.

## 21. Beautiful Lemons: Adverse Selection in Durable-Goods Markets with Sorting
### Author(s):
- Jonathan R. Peterson
- Henry S. Schneider
### Published:
- 29 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
We document a basic characteristic of adverse selection in secondhand markets for durable goods: goods with higher observed quality may have more adverse selection and hence lower unobserved quality. We provide a simple theoretical model to demonstrate this result, which is a consequence of the interaction of sorting between drivers over observed quality and adverse selection over unobserved quality. We then offer empirical support using data on secondhand prices and repair rates of used cars from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and discuss a number of implications for everyday advertising and consumer questions.

## 22. A Nonparametric Joint Assortment and Price Choice Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Jul 2016
### Abstract:
The selection of products and prices offered by a firm significantly impacts its profits. Existing approaches do not provide flexible models that capture the joint effect of assortment and price. We propose a nonparametric framework in which each customer is represented by a particular price threshold and a particular preference list over the alternatives. The customers follow a two-stage choice process; they consider the set of products with prices less than the threshold and choose the most preferred product from the set considered. We develop a tractable nonparametric expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model to the aggregate transaction data and design an efficient algorithm to determine the profit-maximizing combination of offer set and price. We also identify classes of pricing structures of increasing complexity, which determine the computational complexity of the estimation and decision problems. Our pricing structures are naturally expressed as business constraints, allowing a manager to trade off pricing flexibility with computational burden.
