## 1. Fostering Public Good Contributions with Symbolic Awards: A Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment at Wikipedia
### Author(s):
- Jana Gallus
### Published:
- 30 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
This natural field experiment tests the effects of purely symbolic awards on volunteer retention in a public goods context. The experiment is conducted at Wikipedia, which faces declining editor retention rates, particularly among newcomers. Randomization assures that award receipt is orthogonal to previous performance. The analysis reveals that awards have a sizeable effect on newcomer retention, which persists over the four quarters following the initial intervention. This is noteworthy for indicating that awards for volunteers can be effective even if they have no impact on the volunteers’ future career opportunities. The awards are purely symbolic, and the status increment they produce is limited to the recipients’ pseudonymous online identities in a community they have just recently joined. The results can be explained by enhanced self-identification with the community, but they are also in line with recent findings on the role of status and reputation, recognition, and evaluation potential in online communities.

## 2. Opacity, Credit Rating Shopping, and Bias
### Author(s):
- Francesco Sangiorgi

### Published:
- 19 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
We develop a rational expectations model in which an issuer purchases credit ratings sequentially, deciding which to disclose to investors. Opacity about contacts between the issuer and rating agencies induces potential asymmetric information about which ratings the issuer obtained. While the equilibrium forces disclosure of ratings when the market knows these have been generated, endogenous uncertainty about whether there are undisclosed ratings can arise and lead to selective disclosure and rating bias. Although investors account for this bias in pricing, selective disclosure makes ratings noisier signals of project value, leading to inefficient investment decisions. Our paper suggests that regulatory disclosure requirements are welfare enhancing.

## 3. Fantasy and Dread: The Demand for Information and the Consumption Utility of the Future
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
We present evidence that intrinsic demand for information about the future is increasing in expected future consumption utility. In the first experiment, subjects may resolve a lottery now or later. The information is useless for decision making, but the larger the reward, the more likely subjects are to pay to resolve the lottery early. In the second experiment, subjects may pay to avoid being tested for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the more highly feared type 2 (HSV-2). Subjects are three times more likely to avoid testing for HSV-2, suggesting that more aversive outcomes lead to more information avoidance. In a third experiment, subjects make choices about when to get tested for a fictional disease. Some subjects behave in a way consistent with expected utility theory, and others exhibit greater delay of information for more severe diseases. We also find that information choice is correlated with positive affect, ambiguity aversion, and time preference, as some theories predict.

## 4. The Role of Communication of Performance Schemes: Evidence from a Field Experiment

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
In corporate practice, incentive schemes are often complicated even for simple tasks. Hence, the way they are communicated might matter. In a natural field experiment, we study a minimally invasive change in the communication of a well-established incentive scheme—a reminder regarding the piece rate at the beginning of the shift. The experiment was conducted in a large firm where experienced managers work in a team production setting and where incentives for both quantity and quality of output are provided. While the treatment conveyed no additional material information and left the incentive system unchanged, it had significant positive effects on quantity and on managers’ compensation. These effects are economically sizable and robust to alternative empirical specifications. We consider various potential mechanisms, but our preferred explanation is that the treatment raised the salience of incentives.

## 5. The Threat of Exclusion and Implicit Contracting
### Author(s):
- Martin Brown

### Published:
- 3 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
Implicit contracts can mitigate moral hazard in labor, credit, and product markets. The enforcement mechanism underlying an implicit contract is the threat of exclusion: the agent fears that he will lose future income if the principal breaks off the relationship. This threat may be very weak in environments where an agent can appropriate income-generating resources provided by the principal. For example, in credit markets with weak creditor protection, borrowers may be able to appropriate borrowed funds and generate investment income without requiring further loans. We examine implicit contracting in a lending experiment where the threat of exclusion is exogenously varied. We find that weak exclusion undermines implicit contracting: it leads to a more frequent breakdown of credit relationships as well as to smaller loans.

## 6. Incentive-Based Capital Requirements
### Author(s):
- Christian Eufinger
- Andrej Gill
### Published:
- 26 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new regulatory approach that implements capital requirements contingent on executive incentive schemes. We argue that excessive risk taking in the financial sector originates from the shareholder moral hazard created by government guarantees rather than from corporate governance failures within banks. The idea behind the proposed regulatory approach is thus that the more the compensation structure decouples the interests of bank managers from those of shareholders by curbing risk-taking incentives, the higher the leverage the bank is permitted to take on. Consequently, the risk-shifting incentives caused by government guarantees and the risk-mitigating incentives created by the compensation structure offset each other such that the manager chooses the socially efficient investment policy.

## 7. Do Investors Value Dividend-Smoothing Stocks Differently?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 29 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
It is widely documented that managers strive to maintain smooth dividends. Yet, it is not clear if this behavior reflects investors’ preferences. In this paper, we study whether investors indeed value dividend-smoothing stocks differently by exploring the implications of dividend smoothing for firms’ investor clientele, stock prices, and cost of capital. We find that retail investors are less likely to hold dividend-smoothing stocks, while institutional investors, and especially mutual funds, are more likely. However, this preference does not result in any detectable relation between the smoothness of a firm’s dividends and the expected return, or market value, of its stock. Together, the evidence suggests that firms adjust the supply of smoothed dividends to match investors’ demand. Dividend smoothing affects the composition of a firm’s shareholders but has little impact on its stock price.

### Published:
- 11 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Numerous studies argue that the market risk premium is associated with expected economic conditions and show that proxies for expected business conditions indeed predict aggregate market returns. By directly estimating short- and long-run expected economic growth, we show that short-run expected economic growth is negatively related to future returns, whereas long-run expected economic growth is positively related to aggregate market returns. In addition, our findings indicate that the risk premium has both high- and low-frequency fluctuations and highlight the importance of distinguishing short- and long-run economic growth in macro-asset pricing models.

## 9. Robustly Strategic Consumption–Portfolio Rules with Informational Frictions
### Author(s):
- Yulei Luo
### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
This paper provides a tractable continuous-time, constant absolute risk aversion–Gaussian framework to explore how the interactions of fundamental uncertainty, model uncertainty due to a preference for robustness, and state uncertainty due to information-processing constraints (rational inattention) affect strategic consumption–portfolio rules and precautionary savings in the presence of uninsurable labor income. Specifically, after solving the model explicitly, I compute and compare the elasticities of strategic asset allocation and precautionary savings to risk aversion, robustness, and inattention. Furthermore, for plausibly estimated and calibrated model parameters, I quantitatively analyze how the interactions of model uncertainty and state uncertainty affect the optimal share invested in the risky asset and show that they can provide a potential explanation for the observed stockholding behavior of households with different education and income levels.

## 10. Do Local Capital Market Conditions Affect Consumers’ Borrowing Decisions?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 6 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
This paper uses detailed data from an online peer-to-peer lending intermediary to test whether local access to finance affects consumers’ willingness to pay for loans. After controlling for local economic conditions and borrower credit quality, we find that borrowers who reside in areas with good access to bank finance request loans with lower interest rates. This effect is stronger for borrowers with poor credit and those seeking small loans, suggesting that local access to finance is more important for marginal borrowers. Overall, our findings shed light on how consumers substitute between alternative sources of finance.

## 11. Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution in Consumption in the Presence of Inertia: Empirical Evidence from a Natural Experiment
### Author(s):
- Mudit Kapoor
- Shamika Ravi
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
This paper estimates the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption (σ) by exploiting a natural experiment provided by a change in the Indian banking legislation. The new legislation authorized banks to offer higher interest rates on deposits to citizens above 60 years of age. We find evidence that households exhibit inertia in reoptimization and are sensitive to the timing of the actual change in the interest rate. Households do not respond to the predictable changes in future interest rates induced by the change in the legislation. We incorporate this and estimate the σ to be approximately equal to 2.2.

## 12. A Model of Mental Accounting and Reference Price Adaptation
### Author(s):
- Manel Baucells
- Woonam Hwang
### Published:
- 27 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Consumers possess a mental account that stores the worth of items purchased and yet to be consumed. Reference prices act as the book values of these items. Movements in the account—the comparison between the reference price and the price paid at entry, and the comparison between the benefit of consumption and the reference price at exit—yield hedonic benefits. The reference price is determined by a psychological process of adaptation to the price evoked by the trade. The model is integrative in that it explains a wide array of observed anomalies such as sunk-cost effects, payment depreciation, reluctance to trade, preference for prepayment, and the flat-rate bias. The model also generates new testable implications.

## 13. Resource Allocation Under Demand Uncertainty and Private Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 3 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
We study the effect of multilateral private information on the efficiency of markets where capacity-constrained upstream agents supply a resource to downstream entities facing uncertain end-demands. We analyze two models: a “pooling system,” in which a single downstream principal pools a resource from multiple upstream agents; and a “distribution system,” in which one upstream principal allocates a resource across multiple downstream agents. We show that the presence of multilateral private information does not hinder efficiency in the pooling system. In contrast, in the distribution system, the quantities allocated to downstream agents can exceed, as well as fall short of, their first-best levels. These results shed light on the recently improved performance of U.S. agricultural produce market, and the observed episodes of shortages/oversupplies in flu vaccine and other seasonal markets.

## 14. Market Mechanisms in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 7 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
Online peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) has emerged as an appealing new channel of financing in recent years. A fundamental but largely unanswered question in this nascent industry is the choice of market mechanisms, i.e., how the supply and demand of funds are matched, and the terms (price) at which transactions will occur. Two of the most popular mechanisms are auctions (where the “crowd” determines the price of the transaction through an auction process) and posted prices (where the platform determines the price). While P2P lending platforms typically use one or the other, there is little systematic research on the implications of such choices for market participants, transaction outcomes, and social welfare. We address this question both theoretically and empirically. We first develop a game-theoretic model that yields empirically testable hypotheses, taking into account the incentive of the platform. We then test these hypotheses by exploiting a regime change from auctions to posted prices on one of the largest P2P lending platforms. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that under platform-mandated posted prices, loans are funded with higher probability, but the preset interest rates are higher than borrowers’ starting interest rates and contract interest rates in auctions. More important, all else equal, loans funded under posted prices are more likely to default, thereby undermining lenders’ returns on investment and their surplus. Although platform-mandated posted prices may be faster in originating loans, auctions that rely on the crowd to discover prices are not necessarily inferior in terms of overall social welfare.

## 15. Comment on “Strategic Information Management Under Leakage in a Supply Chain”
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Anand and Goyal [Anand KS, Goyal M (2009) Strategic information management under leakage in a supply chain. Management Sci. 55(3):438–452] propose a horizontal differentiation model to study information leakage and demand signaling in a supply chain. The authors present a composite equilibrium consisting of separating and pooling outcomes in different parameter regions and claim that it satisfies the intuitive criterion. We show that their analysis for the pooling equilibrium has errors and also that all pooling outcomes are actually eliminated by the intuitive criterion. The positive note is that if the undefeated equilibrium or the lexicographically maximum sequential equilibrium refinement is adopted, a similar composite equilibrium will be achieved, which will lead to qualitatively the same results as in the original paper.

## 16. When Do People Prefer Carrots to Sticks? A Robust “Matching Effect” in Policy Evaluation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
For a policy to succeed, it must not only be effective in changing behavior but must also be accepted by stakeholders. Here, we report seven sets of studies demonstrating strong framing effects on the acceptance of equivalent policies. Policies targeting desirable voluntary behavior are preferred when they are framed as advantaging those who act desirably (rather than disadvantaging those who do not). Conversely, policies targeting obligations are preferred when they are framed as disadvantaging those who fail to act desirably (rather than advantaging those who do). These differences in policy acceptance do not result from common causes of framing effects, such as a misunderstanding of outcomes or insufficient deliberation about the implications. Rather, the framing effects we document follow from beliefs about when punishment is and is not appropriate. We conclude with a field experiment demonstrating framing effects in a setting where policy acceptance directly affects respondents’ outcomes.

## 17. The Value of Nothing: Asymmetric Attention to Opportunity Costs Drives Intertemporal Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel account of impatience: People pay more attention to the opportunity costs of choosing larger, later rewards than to the opportunity costs of choosing smaller, sooner ones. Eight studies show that when the opportunity costs of choosing smaller, sooner rewards are subtly highlighted, people become more patient, whereas when the opportunity costs of choosing larger, later rewards are highlighted this has no effect. This pattern is robust to variations in the choice task, to the participant population, and to whether the choices are incentivized or hypothetical. We argue that people are naturally aware of the opportunity costs of delayed rewards but pay less attention to those associated with smaller, sooner ones. We conclude by discussing implications for theory and policy.

### Published:
- 16 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
We propose that an important determinant of judged confidence is the evaluation of evidence that is unknown or missing, and overconfidence is often driven by the neglect of unknowns. We contrast this account with prior research suggesting that overconfidence is due to biased processing of known evidence in favor of a focal hypothesis. In Study 1, we asked participants to list their thoughts as they answered two-alternative forced-choice trivia questions and judged the probability that their answers were correct. Participants who thought more about unknowns were less overconfident. In Studies 2 and 3, we asked participants to list unknowns before assessing their confidence. “Considering the unknowns” reduced overconfidence substantially and was more effective than the classic “consider the alternative” debiasing technique. Moreover, considering the unknowns selectively reduced confidence in domains where participants were overconfident but did not affect confidence in domains where participants were well-calibrated or underconfident.

## 19. Anticipated Regret and Product Innovation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
When a firm introduces a product with new features, some consumers may find it difficult to assess their valuations for these new attributes. Their purchase decisions made under such uncertainty may lead to postpurchase regret. It has been experimentally shown that consumers may anticipate their potential postpurchase regret and make their current choices to mitigate or minimize it. That is, a consumer’s anticipated regret can significantly impact his purchase decision. Given the trend that firms in various markets invoke regret to stimulate sales, this paper analytically explores whether and how anticipated regret affects competing firms’ profits and product innovation. Our analyses reveal that the presence of anticipated regret can increase or decrease firms’ profits, and foster or hinder product innovation depending on whether it makes the consumer segments more or less polarized; in other words, anticipated regret has a nonmonotonic effect on firms’ profits and the entrant’s optimal quality. Therefore, anticipated regret may sometimes create a win-win or a lose-lose situation for both firms. Regardless of whether the impact of anticipated regret on firms’ profits is positive or negative, the magnitude of that impact tends to be higher for the low-quality firm.

## 20. Bidding for Bidders? How the Format for Soliciting Supplier Participation in NYOP Auctions Impacts Channel Profit
### Author(s):
- Scott Fay
- Robert Zeithammer
### Published:
- 17 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
In a name-your-own-price (NYOP) auction, consumers bid for a product or service. If a bid exceeds the concealed threshold price, the consumer receives the product at her bid price. This paper examines how to optimize the interactions between the NYOP retailer and service providers, while, at the same time, managing the bid acceptance rates in order to induce the desired consumer bidding behavior. Channel profit is impacted by how the retailer decides whether or not a given consumer bid will be accepted and, if so, which service provider is chosen to supply a unit of the product to the consumer. We devise a mechanism, the modified second-price auction, which maximizes channel profit.

## 21. Sequential Search with Refinement: Model and Application with Click-Stream Data
### Author(s):
- Yuxin Chen
- Song Yao
### Published:
- 28 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
We propose a structural model of consumer sequential search under uncertainty about attribute levels of products. Our identification of the search model relies on exclusion restriction variables that separate consumer utility and search cost. Because such exclusion restrictions are often available in online click-stream data, the identification and corresponding estimation strategy is generalizable for many online shopping websites where such data can be easily collected. Furthermore, one important feature of online search technology is that it gives consumers the ability to refine search results using tools such as sorting and filtering based on product attributes. The proposed model can integrate consumers’ decisions of search and refinement. The model is instantiated using consumer click-stream data of online hotel bookings provided by a travel website. The results show that refinement tools have significant effects on consumer behavior and market structure. We find that the refinement tools encourage 33% more searches and enhance the utility of purchased products by 17%. Most websites by default rank search results according to their popularity, quality, or relevance to consumers (e.g., Google). When consumers are unaware of such default ranking rules, they may engage in disproportionately more searches using refinement tools. Consequently, overall consumer surplus may deteriorate when total search cost outweighs the enhanced utility. In contrast, if the website simply informs consumers that the default ranking already reflects product popularity, quality, or relevance, consumers search less and their surplus improves. We also find that refinement tools lead to a less concentrated market structure.

## 22. Strategic Communication for Capacity Alignment with Pricing in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 9 Sep 2016
### Abstract:
We study a supply chain comprised of a retailer who sources a product from a manufacturer. The retailer has superior forecast information about market demand, and the manufacturer builds the capacity and sets the wholesale price prior to demand realization. We explore forecast information sharing between the retailer and the manufacturer by means of cheap talk. We show that meaningful forecast information can be shared truthfully only before the manufacturer sets both the capacity and the wholesale price. By sharing the demand forecast with the manufacturer, the retailer faces the trade-offs between inflating the forecast to convince the manufacturer to increase capacity and deflating the forecast to persuade the manufacturer to offer a lower wholesale price. When the value of forecast information sharing is high, the trade-offs are balanced, and incentives are aligned, leading to truthful information sharing. Moreover, we find that larger demand uncertainty can promote credible information sharing and, surprisingly, can benefit both firms. Finally, we demonstrate that under general distributions, in equilibrium, firms share forecasts as a form of range/interval, which has been also implemented in practice.

## 23. Efficient Algorithms for the Dynamic Pricing Problem with Reference Price Effect
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
We analyze a finite-horizon dynamic pricing model in which demand at each period depends on not only the current price but also past prices through reference prices. A unique feature but also a significant challenge in this model is the asymmetry in reference price effect, which implies that the underlying optimization problem is nonsmooth and no standard optimization methods can be applied. We identify a few key structural properties of the problem, which enable us to develop strongly polynomial-time algorithms to compute the optimal prices for several plausible scenarios. We complement our exact algorithms by proposing an approximation heuristic and provide an upper bound on the optimal objective value. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to study the optimal price path and demonstrate the value of dynamic pricing when demands are seasonal. We further compare numerically one of the exact algorithms with the heuristic and offer managerial suggestions.

## 24. Inventory Management Based on Target-Oriented Robust Optimization
### Author(s):
- Yun Fong Lim

### Published:
- 21 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
We propose a target-oriented robust optimization approach to solve a multiproduct, multiperiod inventory management problem subject to ordering capacity constraints. We assume the demand for each product in each period is characterized by an uncertainty set that depends only on a reference value and the bounds of the demand. Our goal is to find an ordering policy that maximizes the sizes of all the uncertainty sets such that all demand realizations from the sets will result in a total cost lower than a prespecified cost target. We prove that a static decision rule is optimal for an approximate formulation of the problem, which significantly reduces the computation burden. By tuning the cost target, the resultant policy can achieve a balance between the expected cost and the associated cost variance. Numerical experiments suggest that although only limited demand information is used, the proposed approach performs comparably to traditional methods based on dynamic programming and stochastic programming. More importantly, our approach significantly outperforms the traditional methods if the latter assume inaccurate demand distributions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through two case studies from different industries.

## 25. A Bayesian Methodology for Systemic Risk Assessment in Financial Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 6 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
We develop a Bayesian methodology for systemic risk assessment in financial networks such as the interbank market. Nodes represent participants in the network, and weighted directed edges represent liabilities. Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network. An R package implementing the methodology is provided.
