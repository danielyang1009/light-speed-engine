### 2. Opacity, Credit Rating Shopping, and Bias
#### Author(s):
- Francesco Sangiorgi
- Chester Spatt
#### Date:
- December 19, 2016
#### Abstract:
We develop a rational expectations model in which an issuer purchases credit ratings sequentially, deciding which to disclose to investors. Opacity about contacts between the issuer and rating agencies induces potential asymmetric information about which ...

### 3. Fantasy and Dread: The Demand for Information and the Consumption Utility of the Future
#### Author(s):
- Ananda Ganguly
- Joshua Tasoff
#### Date:
- October 13, 2016
#### Abstract:
We present evidence that intrinsic demand for information about the future is increasing in expected future consumption utility. In the first experiment, subjects may resolve a lottery now or later. The information is useless for decision making, but the ...

#### Author(s):
- Florian Englmaier
- Andreas Roider
- Uwe Sunde
#### Date:
- October 13, 2016
#### Abstract:
In corporate practice, incentive schemes are often complicated even for simple tasks. Hence, the way they are communicated might matter. In a natural field experiment, we study a minimally invasive change in the communication of a well-established ...

### 5. The Threat of Exclusion and Implicit Contracting
#### Author(s):
- Martin Brown
- Marta Serra-Garcia
#### Date:
- November 3, 2016
#### Abstract:
Implicit contracts can mitigate moral hazard in labor, credit, and product markets. The enforcement mechanism underlying an implicit contract is the threat of exclusion: the agent fears that he will lose future income if the principal breaks off the ...

- Mark T. Leary
- Roni Michaely
#### Date:
- September 29, 2016
#### Abstract:
It is widely documented that managers strive to maintain smooth dividends. Yet, it is not clear if this behavior reflects investors’ preferences. In this paper, we study whether investors indeed value dividend-smoothing stocks differently by exploring the ...

#### Author(s):
- Qi Liu
- Libin Tao
- Weixing Wu
- Jianfeng Yu
#### Date:
- October 11, 2016
#### Abstract:
Numerous studies argue that the market risk premium is associated with expected economic conditions and show that proxies for expected business conditions indeed predict aggregate market returns. By directly estimating short- and long-run expected ...

### 12. A Model of Mental Accounting and Reference Price Adaptation
#### Author(s):
- Manel Baucells
- Woonam Hwang
#### Date:
- October 27, 2016
#### Abstract:
Consumers possess a mental account that stores the worth of items purchased and yet to be consumed. Reference prices act as the book values of these items. Movements in the account—the comparison between the reference price and the price paid at entry, ...

- Giuseppe Lopomo
- Shouqiang Wang
#### Date:
- November 3, 2016
#### Abstract:
We study the effect of multilateral private information on the efficiency of markets where capacity-constrained upstream agents supply a resource to downstream entities facing uncertain end-demands. We analyze two models: a “pooling system,” in which a ...

#### Date:
- September 7, 2016
#### Abstract:
Online peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) has emerged as an appealing new channel of financing in recent years. A fundamental but largely unanswered question in this nascent industry is the choice of market mechanisms, i.e., how the supply and demand of ...

#### Author(s):
- Daniel Read
- Christopher Y. Olivola
- David J. Hardisty
#### Date:
- October 13, 2016
#### Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel account of impatience: People pay more attention to the opportunity costs of choosing larger, later rewards than to the opportunity costs of choosing smaller, sooner ones. Eight studies show that when the opportunity costs of ...

#### Author(s):
- Daniel J. Walters
- Philip M. Fernbach
- Craig R. Fox
- Steven A. Sloman
#### Date:
- December 16, 2016
#### Abstract:
We propose that an important determinant of judged confidence is the evaluation of evidence that is unknown or missing, and overconfidence is often driven by the neglect of unknowns. We contrast this account with prior research suggesting that ...

- Özge Turut
#### Date:
