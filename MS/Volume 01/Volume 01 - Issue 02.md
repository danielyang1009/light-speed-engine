## 1. Computing in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Cuthbert C. Hurd
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
First, there will be a general description of the nature of a computing or data processing machine followed by illustrations of how it is that computers can speed the processing of information. Section II discusses the character of scientific method in order to form a basis for the ideas to be described under Sections III, IV, and V. Section III considers linear equations, with examples being given of their application to management problems. Section IV involves the notion of simulation, together with examples of how this idea can be used in management. Section V includes the design of experiments particularly with respect to obtaining better statistics for use in simulation.

## 2. “Management Science” and the Manager
### Author(s):
- Peter F. Drucker
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
Most of the writing on the new “Management Science,” that is on the application of systematic methodology to the job of managing in the business enterprise, has so far come from the scientists. Understandably it has therefore focused on the finding of areas in business to which the scientist can apply tools and techniques with which he is already familiar, and on the sharpening and development of these tools. The all but universal approach has been: here is a scientific method, here are scientific tools and techniques; let us find applications for them in the business enterprise.

## 3. Elements for a Theory of Teams
### Author(s):
- J. Marschak
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
Recent attempts to analyze organization problems in a scientific manner were stimulated by the classical economic theory of the firm (Walrus, Marshall) and by the newer theories of statistical decision functions (Neymann, Wald), the theory of games (von Neumann and Morgenstern), and the theory of communications (Wiener, Shannon). The Office of Naval Research, and especially its Logistics Branch, has encouraged this development. The task is big and can be carried out only step by step. The first step has been to study a particularly simple form of organization which we call a team.

## 4. Optimal Estimation of Executive Compensation by Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- R. O. Ferguson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
Linear programming, as an optimizing method for handling a mass of interacting variables, has received considerable attention in applications to such problems as production scheduling, logistics, and mobilization studies. But linear programming may also be used in a variety of other ways. This paper is concerned with one such alternative use. It will be shown how, by appropriate adaptations, the methods of linear programming may be used to obtain estimates of parameters when more usual methods, such as “least squares,” are difficult or impossible to apply.

## 5. Mathematical Programming of Portfolio Selections
### Author(s):
- A. D. Martin, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to analyze and explain, by reference to empirical data, some of the recent work done in this area by Dr. Harry Markowitz under the sponsorship of the Cowles Commission (Cowles Commission Discussion Papers in Economics Nos. 294, 2005, and 2019. Also, “Portfolio Selection,” Journal of Finance, March 1952.). This article is divided into four parts. Part I contains a heuristic introduction to the basic problem together with a mathematical statement of Markowitz's theory of portfolio selection and its basic assumptions. Part II contains a discussion of some of the problems involved in formulating probability beliefs for available investment opportunities. In Part III, the selection technique is demonstrated by application to a very simplified case, and many of the problems involved in more complex cases are brought out. The final section contains a summarization and critique of the theory, its limitations, and its possibilities as a guide to practical decision-making.

## 6. Symposium: Management Science Today and Tomorrow—Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Merrill M. Flood
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
Economists and psychologists are interested in the theory of human decision making behavior. So are neurophysiologists and psychoanalysts. So also are statisticians, game theorists, cyberneticians, information theorists, operations researchers and many others among the management scientists.

## 7. Survey of Research on Mathematical Solutions of Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Alex Orden
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
My topic in this panel discussion on management science today is the status of research on mathematical solution of programming problems. The word “programming” refers here to optimal allocation, as in machine loading, or to optimal scheduling of one kind or another. “Optimal allocation” may be taken as referring to static problems, while “optimal scheduling” refers to dynamic problems, varying over time. The static and dynamic problems are, at the present stage of management science development, generally speaking, studied by means of the same techniques.

## 8. Towards an Integrated Framework of Data Analysis
### Author(s):
- Ezra Glaser
### Published:

### Abstract:
Essay delivered, as a symposium paper on “Management Science Tomorrow,” before the first national meeting of the Institute of Management Sciences, Oct. 21–22, 1954.

## 9. Behavioral Management Science
### Author(s):
- Samuel P. Hayes, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
In the management science of tomorrow, I predict, there will be a great growth of these and other techniques whereby practitioners and scientists will inform, stimulate and influence each other. One of the most fruitful functions of this new Institute, in my opinion, would be to put some of its intellect and energy into developing such techniques. One of the most important management sciences of tomorrow could well be the science that joins management science and management.

## 10. Future of Mathematics in Management Science
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
My assignment is to discuss mathematics in the management science of tomorrow. The preceding talks have dealt with potential uses by management of emerging and possible scientific developments. In approaching my assignment I would like to shift the emphasis slightly in order to discuss possible repercussions of a developing science of management on mathematics as well as possible repercussions of mathematical developments for the science of management.

## 12. Management Science, The Journal
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1955
### Abstract:
These remarks are concerned with the policies of the journal of the Institute. A journal not only serves as a basis of communication for its time, but also as a monument of effort for some future age. The singularity of the title Management Science dedicates us to the proposition that a science of human administration is a real possibility. Whatever sort of monument our journal may be for the future, its keystone will consist in this conviction.
