## 2. Static and Dynamic Assignment Models with Multiple Objectives, and Some Remarks on Organization Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1969
### Abstract:
The assignment model of linear programming is here extended to allow for vector optimizations and dynamic interactions between assigned personnel and positions in each of which a variety of possible measures and approaches are explored. Formulations involving people-to-people as well as people-to-position matchings are also examined from the standpoint of organizations in which jobs may be fitted to people or vice versa as well as in weighted combinations. Possible uses of such models for dealing with the problems of placing disadvantsged or handicapped persons are noted, but the analysis stops short of the still further possibilities offered by new types of machine-technology and information systems designs.

## 3. The Analysis of Uncertainty Resolution in Capital Budgeting for new Products
### Author(s):
- James C. Van Horne
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1969
### Abstract:
In this paper, a method is developed for analyzing the resolution of uncertainty over time for the individual new product and for combinations of existing and new products, or the firm's over-all product mix. Probability concepts are employed, and it is shown that new products can be evaluated according to their marginal impact upon the resolution of the uncertainty pattern for the firm's total product mix. The analysis of this dimension is undertaken within a capital-budgeting framework, allowing a GO or NO decision to be reached for the new product under consideration. Information about when uncertainty is expected to be resolved enables management to evaluate more realistically the effect of a new-product decision on the riskiness of the firm's entire product mix. This knowledge is valuable in planning for new products and in balancing the firm's risk over time. As a result, more rational capital budgeting for new products is possible.

### Abstract:
Bell System applications of management science are reviewed, with examples, under three categories: (a) Facilities—providing the physical communications plant, (b) Operations—concerning both the plant and the organization, and (c) Marketing—determining services to be offered and rates.

## 5. The Use of the Compound Poisson in Pert
### Author(s):
- William H. Parks
- Kenneth D. Ramsing
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1969
### Abstract:
The use of the normal or Beta distributions has become well established for PERT applications. The authors question whether the use of these standardized distributions yields the best answers in some cases and submits an alternative method of computing the critical path using a compound poisson distribution. This change requires adapting many of the PERT assumptions to the new distribution.

## 6. A Dialectical Approach to Strategic Planning
### Author(s):
- Richard O. Mason
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1969
### Abstract:
This paper develops a new approach to the planning process. It begins by examining the critical role played by the planner's assumptions. Two criteria for a good planning technique are suggested by this examination: (1) It should expose the assumptions underlying a proposed plan so that management can reconsider them and (2) it should suggest new and more relevant assumptions upon which the planning process can proceed.

## 7. Extensions of Bowman's Theory on Managerial Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- Howard Kunreuther
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1969
### Abstract:
Bowman has developed a theory which claims that a manager makes good decisions on the average but that he may exhibit a high variance in his behavior. This paper proposes three general criteria which must be satisfied for this theory to have validity. These tests are then used to evaluate a production planning model for an electronics firm where the rules are based on “average” past behavior. Several interesting results emerge when comparing the production plans based on an “average” rule with the actual plans for the company. When the manager has limited information regarding future sales, as when he develops his initial production estimates, then a plan based on average behavior performs considerably better than actual initial plans. However, when environmental cues provide reliable information on future sales of specific items (as when revisions are made) then actual decisions are clearly superior to those suggested by an average rule. This case study offers insight into the potential usefulness as well as the limitations of Bowman's hypothesis. Suggestions for future research in this general area conclude the discussion.
