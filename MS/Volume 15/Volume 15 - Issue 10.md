## 1. Free For All—Guest Editorial: Social Change and the “Evaluative Function” in Government
### Author(s):
- Nicholas E. Golovin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
In searches for rational policy alternatives concerning circumscribed sectors of governmental activity it is sometimes difficult to reach satisfactory conclusions without expanding the “universe of discourse.” And, the broader the sector and/or the higher the level of government, the more likely it is that useful results will not be obtained without viewing at least some of the aspects of the problem of interest from a national or more general point of view. Thus, during the writer's involvement with apparently well delimited problems in the management of federal research and development programs, efforts to develop rationales for decisions about program priorities invariably resulted in need to dispose first of questions falling outside the terms of reference for the issues at hand. The concepts of an “evaluative function” and, specifically, of an “evaluative branch” of government, arose in the course of attempts to overcome this difficulty. And, in exploring some of their implications beyond the confines of science and technology, it became apparent that applications promised improvement in governmental and private sector capabilities for dealing, at least theoretically, with a number of socio-economic problems now concerning the several levels of government in the United States.

## 3. Parallel Strategies in Development Projects
### Author(s):
- William J. Abernathy
- Richard S. Rosenbloom
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
It is common in R & D to identify and explore several approaches to a particular objective so that the best approach may be chosen. The outcome of any approach is uncertain; hence, it is difficult to choose the best one at an early date. To deal with this uncertainty, two or more approaches to the objective may be continued in parallel until a clear choice can be made, i.e., a parallel strategy. Such a strategy can provide better information for a decision, maintain options, or hedge against the occurrence of an unsatisfactory outcome.

## 4. Synthesis of Several Techniques
### Author(s):
- Billy E. Goetz
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
Business systems analysis can have many forms and names, accounting, Industrial Dynamics,1 operations research, motion and time study, and budgeting, etc. These should not be considered as separate, but as systems where each can contribute enormously to the power of the others—the integrated whole is immensely greater than the sum of the parts. Each produces an analog of an enterprise system or subsystem, and these analogs simulate the behavior of the system caricatured. I contend that each would gain enormously in power if all were merged into a single analog as against their treatment as separate independent analogs.

## 5. An Application of Chance Constrained Programming to Portfolio Selection in a Casualty Insurance Firm
### Author(s):
- N. H. Agnew
- R. A. Agnew
- J. Rasmussen
- K. R. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
The problem of portfolio selection is discussed with special emphasis on the casualty insurance firm. A single period optimisation model is developed in which expected return is maximized subject to a chance constraint requiring return to be greater than some lower bound with a stipulated probability. It is demonstrated that this approach provides an operational means of selecting a Baumol efficient portfolio. Additional chance constraints are used to maintain the firm's liquidity. The evaluation of optimal portfolios is discussed and the evaluators for the portfolio model are developed. Finally, an example is provided.

## 6. Catalog Advertising Allocation
### Author(s):
- W. D. Sokolick
- Philip H. Hartung
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
The catalog advertising allocation problem is one of allocating space (pages) in a catalog to products. Different allocations of space will have different catalog preparation costs and will produce different total catalog sales. This paper presents a model to forecast the sales results of different space allocations, reports on the empirical validity of the forecasts, and then presents a model to maximize sales subject to a total catalog cost constraint.

## 7. Operational Gaming Simulation with Application to a Stock Market
### Author(s):
- Norman N. Barish
- Frederick H. Siff
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
This paper presents a concept of operational gaming with important new features and describes its implementation. One of these new features is the incorporation in the model of computer generated play whose character is determined by the action of the players as well as computer programmed stochastic characteristics.

## 8. Determination of Warranty Reserves
### Author(s):
- Warren W. Menke
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
Cost of warranty claims for failure of a product is an identifiable business cost. Methods of calculation are presented for determining this cost item for a linear prorata rebate plan and for a lump sum rebate plan where the customer receives a fixed amount for any failures within the warranty period. It is shown that a calculable amount, usually modest for good products, can be allocated by the manufacturer to a warranty reserve fund to cover the expected risks of warranty claims. Additionally, it is shown that the insight gained by a manufacturer about the components contributing to warranty reserve funding can furnish him with new marketing strategies.

## 9. A Computer Aided Decision System
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Ferguson
- Curtis H. Jones
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
The use of on-line, real-time computer-based information systems to augment managerial decision making raises interesting and significant questions. In search of operational answers, the authors have developed and conducted experiments with a time-sharing computer model. By modeling the dynamics of a job shop the authors were able both to make use of and to evaluate academic research in job shop scheduling. The authors have devised a specific apportionment of the problem environment which permits users of their information system to explore the effects of various combinations of heuristics and programmed decision rules. The response of over 300 managers and academicians who have participated in the experiments provides evidence of the practicality of such an approach to multi-dimensional, time-variant problem solving.

## 10. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry A. Stern
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1969
### Abstract:
In spite of the growth of the computer industry, computers have received only grudging acceptances by the management of most businesses. Computers, however, are often completely accepted in an operational capacity, and are widely used for payroll, labor distribution, billing and sales statistics, as well as for more exotic applications such as gasoline or sausage blending. But beyond their use in operations, there seems to be tremendous resistance to the encroachment of the computer into management domains.
