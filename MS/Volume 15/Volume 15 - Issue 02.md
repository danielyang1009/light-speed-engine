## 2. Robustness in Sequential Investment Decisions
### Author(s):
- Shiv K. Gupta
- Jonathan Rosenhead
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
Long-range investment plans, particularly for expansion or decentralization, often consist of a number of separate but interacting investments spaced over a number of years. Where there is appreciable uncertainty about external conditions in the future, it is possible that a “best” scheme based on the state of current knowledge will prove during the course of the intervening years to be less than good. One way of guarding against this danger is to ensure that the early (and therefore irreversible) steps in the investment sequence keep open as many options of “good” schemes as possible. Concepts of robustness and stability are developed. As a practical example of the use of these concepts a case study is presented, which deals with the location of sites for new factories in an industrial expansion program.

## 3. The Formulation of Credit Policy Models
### Author(s):
- Dileep Mehta
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
This study undertakes to apply the statistical technique of sequential decision process to a specific range of problems of (trade) credit management. In particular, the study examines two problems: first, credit extension policy on a specific request or account; and second, construction of indices measuring the effectiveness of such a policy. The end goal is to establish a control system which has heretofore resisted analytical solution.

## 4. An Extension of Lawler and Bell's Method of Discrete Optimization with Examples from Capital Budgeting
### Author(s):
- James C. T. Mao
- B. A. Wallingford
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
The usefulness of integer programming as a tool of capital budgeting hinges on the development of an efficient solution technique. An algorithm based on partial enumeration has been developed by E. L. Lawler and M. D. Bell for solving integer linear programs with 0–1 decision variables; however their algorithm is not general enough to deal with all problems in which the objective function is quadratic. This paper extends Lawler and Bell's method so that it can be generally applied to integer quadratic programs. The new algorithm is illustrated by examples from capital budgeting.

## 5. The Consensus of Subjective Probability Distributions
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
“‘But we can't agree whether A or B is correct,' he concluded, ‘and so we're collecting expert opinions, weighting them appropriately, and programming WESCAC to arbitrate the whole question.’” (John Barth, Giles Goat-Boy, p. 664.)

## 6. Judgment Estimates of the Moments of Pert Type Distributions
### Author(s):
- Joseph J. Moder
- E. G. Rodgers
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of estimating the moments of a statistical distribution from judgment estimates of various percentiles of the distribution and its mode. The results of this study indicate that 5 and 95 percentiles are superior to the 0 and 100 percentiles used in classical PERT; they lead to estimates that are robust to variations in the shape of the distribution, and also there is some experimental evidence which indicates that they can be estimated more accurately from one's “experience.” It was also found experimentally that the single time estimate used in CPM gave a slightly biased estimate of the mean, whereas the three time estimates used in PERT gave unbiased estimates of the mean.

## 7. A Lock-Box Model
### Author(s):
- James McN. Stancill, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
Faced with the problem of trying to reduce investment in accounts receivable, a number of corporate finance managers have directed attention to the problem of undesired “float,” i.e., the dollar amount of checks payable to the subject firm but unavailable for cashing because they are in process of transmittal via the mail system. One of the most direct ways to reduce such undesirable “float” is through the use of what is called a “lock-box” arrangement.

## 8. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1968
### Abstract:
Large data systems are expensive and difficult to construct even where the inputs are well defined. In the following paper, “The Computer—New Partner in Investment Management,” Dr. Arnold E. Amstutz of the MIT Sloan School of Management describes work done on a system, where, although the data was well defined, the effort of understanding how it would be utilized and organized spread over seven years. Essential to the success of the work that Dr. Amstutz describes was the emphasis upon both measurement and structure.
