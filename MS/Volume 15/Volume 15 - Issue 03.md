## 1. Optimal Dividend and Investment Policies for a Self-Financing Business Enterprise
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
For a self-financing business enterprise (or for an underdeveloped economy subject to constraints on the availability of foreign investment funds), three theorems are presented. Each result is based upon the assumption that the firm's investment opportunities follow constant returns-to-scale, and are of the “point input—stream output” type.

## 2. Optimal Cash Balance Levels
### Author(s):
- Nadia Makary Girgis
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
The problem considered in this paper deals with the optimal policies for keeping cash in anticipation of future net expenses. It is an inventory problem in which the inventory level can either decrease or increase, and the decision maker is allowed to change the inventory level in any direction at the beginning of each period. In addition to the usual holding and shortage costs, the problem involves fixed and proportional costs for deciding to change the inventory level. This paper shows the form of the optimal policy if the expected holding and shortage cost is convex and if deciding either to increase or to decrease the inventory level does not involve a fixed cost.

## 3. Difference Equations in Forecasting Formulas
### Author(s):

- A. G. Fowler
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
The deviation of actual sales (or other time-dependent statistics) from a model of sales will give rise to forecasting errors that are enhanced, damped out, or shifted in phase, depending on the particular formulas that are used for forecasting. Following R. G. Brown, P. Winters, and Theil, Nerlove, and Wage, we start from a general set of forecasting formulas, but make fewer assumptions than those authors about deviations from the model, and obtain a more extensive collection of results. In particular, we show how to treat errors not serially uncorrelated, and how to investigate forecasting formulas of order higher than second.

## 4. Optimal Ordering and Rationing Policies in a Nonstationary Dynamic Inventory Model with n Demand Classes
### Author(s):
- Donald M. Topkis
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
We consider the problems associated with an inventory system in which demands for stock are of n classes of varying importance. When demand from a given class arrives one must decide whether to satisfy it or to not satisfy it and conserve stock for possible use later to satisfy demand from a more important class. Conditions are given under which the optimal rationing policy between successive procurements of new stock is determined by a set of critical rationing levels such that at a given time one satisfies demand of a given class only if no demand of a more important class remains unsatisfied and as long as the stock level does not fall below the critical rationing level for that class at that time. Conditions are also given under which the optimal procurement policy at a given time is determined by a single critical level in the usual manner. Further conditions are given which assure that the optimal rationing and procurement policies may be determined myopically.

## 5. A New Approach to Discrete Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- G. Graves
- A. Whinston
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents the theoretical foundations for a new approach to integer programming. On the basis of the theoretical arguments, various specific computational procedures are developed which could be used to solve the integer programming problem. However, definitive computational results are not presented. In future papers we plan to explore the various computational options developed here.

## 6. Application of Combinatorial Programming to a Class of All-Zero-One Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- John F. Pierce
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1968
### Abstract:
Problem-solving procedures based on the methods of combinatorial programming are presented for solving a class of integer programming problems in which all elements are zero or one. All of the procedures seek first a feasible solution and then successively better and better feasible solutions until ultimately one is discovered which is shown to be optimal. By representing the problem elements in a binary computer as bits in a word and employing logical “and” and “or” operations in the problem-solving process, a number of problems involving several hundred integer variables have been solved in a matter of seconds.
