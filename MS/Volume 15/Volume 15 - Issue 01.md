## 1. Optimization and Suboptimization: The Method of Extended Models in the Non-Linear Case
### Author(s):
- F. Bessiere

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
Let us consider some particular optimization problem. Most of ita data is determined by the economic “environment”. However, this environment is evolutive, and may be the subject of an optimization research. The particular problem first considered then appears to be a suboptimization, and its results will be valid only if it is separable from its environment.

## 2. On Decision Theory Under Competition
### Author(s):
- James R. Jackson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
Decision theory treats models in which a decision maker must choose an information function and a decision function, where the former transforms states of nature into messages, the latter transforms messages into actions, and the ultimate payoff depends upon the state of nature, the message, and the action. This paper treats similar models in which nature's role is played by a selfseeking rational opponent. These models fall into the purview of the theory of two-person games, and the main results concern the maximin and minimax theories of these games. The various games treated differ in the assumptions made about the decision maker's ability to probability mix his choices and about his opponent's information concerning these choices. Twenty different sets of assumptions are considered, but it is shown that the maximin and minimax theories of the resulting games are all reducible in substance to those of just three games: (i) in which the decision maker cannot probability mix his choices at all, and his opponent observes both choices; (ii) in which the decision maker can mix arbitrarily, and his opponent observes neither of his choices; or (iii) in which the decision maker can mix decision functions only, and his opponent observes only the information function. These games are represented in terms of matrix games, and the matrices are compressed by the deletion of dominated strategies for the decision maker. Further compressions are obtained for the case in which the cost of information is separable from the payoff resulting from the actions of the decision maker and his opponent. The game matrices are finally reduced to manageable proportions for the further specialized cases in which either the capacity of the decision maker's information channel is significantly limited and information cost is constant, or the capacity of the information channel is large and there is one low—cost “non-message” available. A numerical example is given, and the concluding comments point to directions for further research.

## 3. Probability of Survival as an Investment Criterion
### Author(s):
- Fred Hanssmann
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
Suppose that an investing firm is primarily interested in achieving a specified minimum return critical to its economic survival. Then it seems appropriate to maximize the probability of exceeding the aspiration level. This decision criterion will be applied in the context of several stochastic static investment models with budget constraint. As long as the aspiration level does not exceed the maximum expected return achievable with the given budget, the desired investment strategy must be sought among the efficient solutions in the Markowitz sense. For higher aspiration levels this is no longer true. For the special case of the Markowitz model we show that all investment projects with expected yield not exceeding the aspiration level (of yield) should be rejected. This is a surprising confirmation of a well-known deterministic rule of investment theory and practice in a rather different context.

## 4. Optimal Operations & Investments of the Firm
### Author(s):
- Russell G. Thompson
- Melvin D. George
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
In this paper, a dynamic continuous time model of the firm, encompassing operations and investments, is formulated as an optimal control problem in an activity analysis context. In the model, the objective of the firm is to maximize, subject to various constraints, the discounted value of operating profits less the costs of new capacity and the interest on borrowed funds (or plus the interest on savings) over a fixed decision-making interval plus the discounted value of capacity at the end of the period. The state variables are capacity and debt, and the controls are scale of operation and rate of purchase of new capacity; the final capacity and debt are control parameters. There are several inequality constraints.

## 5. Theory of Investment Behavior and Empirical Analysis of Stock Market Price Relatives
### Author(s):
- Fred B. Renwick
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
This paper examines the hypothesis that “outliers” observed in empirical frequency distributions of share price relatives can be anticipated and explained via the theory of financial analysis. Specifically, price is treated as a ratio estimate. Each term in the estimate is subject to error, and both numerator and denominator of the ratio are considered to be normally distributed. Then deviations from the ideal Gaussian form for the empirical frequency distributions of change in price are explained in terms of fundamental economic variables that interact to determine numerical values for the numerator and denominator of the ratio.

## 6. Discrete Stochastic Programming
### Author(s):
- K. D. Cocks
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
A method is presented for solving linear programming problems where (any number of) the functional, restraint, and input-output coefficients are subject to discrete; probability distributions. The objective function is formulated in terms of variance and/or expectation.

## 7. On (s, S) Policies
### Author(s):
- Ellis L. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
For the infinite horizon, single item inventory problem, assume an ordering cost M(i) + K(j) for changing the stock level from i to j (for example, M(i) + K(j) = c · (j − i) + K), a holding plus shortage cost l(j), and a probability φ (j, k) of demand j − k when the stock level is j. New conditions for optimality of (s, S) policies are given, and a computational method is given. Both the total discounted cost and the average cost criteria are treated. The method is simplified when the demand distribution is Bernoulli or geometric. When, in addition, the costs K(j) = K, and l(x) is −Lx for x > 0, zero for 0 ≦ x ≦ I, for some I ≧ 0, and H(x − I) for x > I, then conditions are given for an optimal policy (s*, S*) to have s* = −1 or S* = I. Further, for the same assumptions but without the integrality restriction on s and S, specific formulas are given for s* and S* when the criterion is average cost; and equations, which can be solved for s* and S*, are given when the criterion is total discounted cost.

## 8. An n Job, One Machine Sequencing Algorithm for Minimizing the Number of Late Jobs
### Author(s):
- J. Michael Moore
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
An algorithm, computationally feasible for large problems, has been formulated for sequencing n jobs through a single facility to minimize the number of late jobs. This algorithm is then extended to solve the problem in which each job is associated with a continuous, monotone non-decreasing deferral cost function. The object is to produce a schedule where the maximum deferral cost incurred is minimal.

## 9. Communications to the Editor—A Feasible Approach to General Purpose Sampling Design
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents an approach to the following problem involving uncertainty: the choice of sample design for the estimation of parameters which are not identified prior to the sample selection. More specificly, the author suggests the use of “contingency planning” as developed in the realm of military systems analysis, to supplement the use of standard sample survey theory.
