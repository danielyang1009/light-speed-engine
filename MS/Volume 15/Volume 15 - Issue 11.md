## 1. A Computer Aided Approach to Employment Service Placement and Counseling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
An employment service ideally should enable workers to maximize their monetary and psychic job satisfactions and employers to maximize their productivity for each dollar or labor cost. Electronic computers can make their greatest contribution to this effort if they are programmed so as to maximize the extent to which the objectives of workers and employers are fulfilled. This paper seeks to develop a formal optimizing approach using functional estimates of the satisfactions and productivities and of the probabilities of job offers and acceptances. Making these concepts operational appears feasible, but substantial research will be needed. The socio-economic payoffs appear to justify the cost of such research. The employment service operations proposed in the article include a man-machine system in which the computer serves as aide to the placement counselor.

## 2. Decision Making in a Complex Environment: The use of Similarity Judgements to Predict Preferences
### Author(s):
- David Klahr
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
Judgments of the relative similarity of pairs of alternatives are used to construct a model of the decision space of a group of college admissions officers. This model is then used to predict the preferences of the officers. The accuracy of the predictions supports the hypothesis that preference judgments are made on the basis of the similarity of given alternatives to an “ideal” alternative. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling procedure is used to construct the space. This procedure yields a dimensional representation based upon very few assumptions about the nature of the similarity measures.

## 3. Statistical Decision Models for Brokering
### Author(s):
- Jerome Bracken
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
Statistical decision models are formulated for a decision situation involving a decision maker who is a broker, a person engaged in bringing together sellers and buyers to make transactions. The objective of the analysis is the determination of a plan in accordance with the broker's subjective estimates which can serve as a guide for optimally allocating his energies.

## 4. Duality in Markov Decision Problems with Countable Action and State Spaces
### Author(s):
- John P. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
The recent literature contains several papers which explore mathematical programming formulations of particular Markov sequential decision problems. Each of these papers deals with finite state and action spaces; thus, the corresponding programming formulations yield dual finite linear programs. In this paper these investigations are extended to include countable action and/or state spaces for finite horison problems. Of particular interest are the duality aspects of the mathematical programming formulations. In addition, employing conditions analogous to fundamental concepts of Haar semi-infinite dual programming, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal rules for countable action spaces. Guided by the semi-infinite duality theory we explore mathematical programming formulations for two cases: 1) Countable action space and finite state space—the result is a pair of dual semi-infinite programs; and 2) Finite action space and countable state space—we obtain a pair of infinite programs. In the latter case we show that no duality gap occurs and obtain duality results comparable to those of finite linear programming.

## 5. A Time-Sharing Queue
### Author(s):
- I. Adiri
- B. Avi-Itzhak
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
The paper investigates in detail a single server single queue time-sharing system with homogeneous Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed service times. The important variables affecting the design and operation of the system were investigated, and the results are given in terms of steady-state expectations and distribution transforms. An attempt is made to demonstrate the influence of various systems's parameters on the overall performance. Special attention is given to optimisation with respect to quantum size. It is hoped that some of the results may serve as guidelines in the design and operation of time-sharing systems.

## 6. Queuing Analysis of Real-Time Computer Processing
### Author(s):
- W. Chang
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
Recently the development of the real-time environment has influenced the design and altered the concepts of computer oriented systems. A priority queuing model was developed to analyse the performance of a simple real-time computer system. The jobs come from remoted stations and form a Poisson process. Each job consists of two tasks: the communication task which is placed in the high priority queue, and a processing task which is executed by the computer on an available basis. The stationary queue length and the waiting time distributions are investigated.

## 7. Optimal Ordering Policies for a Continuous Time, Deterministic Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Falkner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
A deterministic, continuous time, nonstationary inventory model is formulated to find the number of orders, the order quantities, and the times at which orders should be placed which minimize the total cost over a finite time horizon of meeting a given requirements function. Both backlogging and no backlogging are considered. Conditions are given for the existence of an optimal policy with a regeneration point property which permits the order quantities to be calculated from the requirements function. The conditions for an optimal policy permit the use of a purchase cost function providing for quantity discounts. Two examples are considered.

## 8. Statistical Estimation Problems in Inventory Control
### Author(s):
- R. H. Hayes
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
In this paper we define and illustrate the use of the concept of "Expected Total Operating Cost" (ETOC) in dealing with inventory policy estimation when the cost structure is piecewise linear. We show, through examples, that estimates based on classical procedures are often unsatisfactory when viewed in terms of ETOC, and derive improved estimates. Then we look at the problem from a Bayesian point of view and derive the prior distributions (within a particular class) that are implied by the adoption of these superior procedures.

## 9. A Markovian Replacement Model with a Generalization to Include Stocking
### Author(s):
- Sheldon M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
The following model is considered: A machine is inspected at the beginning of discrete time periods and its operating state (condition) is determined. After each inspection a decision upon whether or not to replace the machine at the end of the period must be made. It is shown that under certain conditions on the costs and the transition distributions the optimal policy has a simple form. A generalisation to the case where one is allowed to stock reserve machines is also given.

## 10. A “Variable s” Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Robert G. Sargent
- Hugh E. Bradley
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
This paper develops a linear periodic review inventory model in which the reorder rule is an extension of the “order up to S” or (S, T) policy where S varies as a general linear function of demand and net inventory. Stationary and non-stationary demand processes are considered. Lead time is assumed to be an integral multiple of the review period and, at most, an independent and identically distributed random variable. Analysis of the model includes stability, transient response, steady-state response, and the effects of common nonlinearities.

## 11. Optimal Allocation for a Class of Finite Horizon Processes
### Author(s):
- Alan Seelenfreund
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1969
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to derive a fundamental frame of reference for the analysis of a class of multistage decision problems that have been separately treated in the literature. It is hoped that exposition of the basic structure of these problems in a general setting will provide a convenient point of departure for future investigations. Specific examples of problems in this class are the capital budgeting problem of Dorfman [Dorfman, R. 1963. Regional allocation of investment: Comment. Quart. J. Econom. (Feb.)], the warehouse problem of Dreyfus [Dreyfus, S. 1957. An analytic solution of the warehouse problem. Management Sci.4(1, Oct.)], the price speculation model of Arrow and Karlin [Arrow, K. J., S. Karlin. 1958. Price speculation under certainty. Chapter 13 in Arrow, K. J., L. Hurwicz, H. Uzawa. Studies in Linear and Non-linear Programming. Stanford University Press, Stanford, Calif.] and the work on multistage linear programs by Dantzig [Dantzig, G. B. 1959. On the status of multistage linear programming problems. Management Sci.2(1, Oct.)]. The special results elucidating the structure of optimal solutions to these problems may all be obtained by application of the Linearity Theorem proven in this paper.
