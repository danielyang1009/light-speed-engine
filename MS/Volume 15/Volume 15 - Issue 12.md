## 3. Some New Views on the Payback Period and Capital Budgeting Decisions
### Author(s):
- H. Martin Weingartner
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
The Payback Period has been dismissed as misleading and worthless by most writers on capital budgeting at the same time that businessmen continue to utilise this concept. This paper seeks to identify the problems which businessmen try to solve by use of the payback period, so that better tools can be provided for solving these, since neither the present value nor the internal rate of return does so.

## 4. Simulation and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of New York's Emergency Ambulance Service
### Author(s):
- E. S. Savas
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
Computer simulation was used to analyze the possible improvements in ambulance service that would result from proposed changes in the number and location of ambulances. The cost-effectiveness of several alternatives was examined. A particular alternative was shown to be of considerable value and it was concluded that low-cost improvements in service could indeed be achieved by redistributing ambulances in accordance with this alternative.

## 5. Minimizing Customer Line Items Backordered in Inventory Control
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
This paper considers the theory and application of an alternative measure of stock-out cost in inventory control. Instead of recording the number of units of a product which are backordered, in certain situations it is appropriate to focus on the number or percentage of customer line items (requests for a particular item) which are backordered. By combining an approximate backorder cost per customer line item backordered with the usual ordering and carrying costs, an approximately optimal reorder point (or safety stock) formula is derived. The formula is applied to a stratified sample of 500 products from an actual inventory system, and an estimated 13% reduction in customer line items backordered is obtained with no increase in total inventory investment.

## 6. Fundamental Issues in the Simulation of Human Behavior: A Case in the Strategy of Behavioral Science
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
Every scientific study has its own unique case history. Unfortunately, most scientific papers present a greatly distorted and static image of the true history and sociology of a research project. This paper represents an attempt to report on selected aspects of the actual growth and development of a simulation project, especially as that process affected the development of a novel method for validating simulation models. The paper also represents a philosophical analysis of the concept of simulation, especially as that analysis formed an integral part of the study's development.

## 7. Investment Analysis Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Robert Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
Investment projects are described in this paper as a pattern of uncertain cash flows over time; i.e., as a cash flow pattern over an event tree. Whereas the portfolio problem of selecting projects generally requires simultaneous consideration of all available projects, here we seek sufficient conditions for accepting and rejecting individual projects. These conditions are formulated as mathematical programming problems which are amenable to routine application at subordinate levels of an organization.

## 8. Solving Production Smoothing Problems
### Author(s):
- Jay R. Galbraith
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1969
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the problem of balancing resource capacity utilization against the costs of user delay or inventory investment. Instead of formulating algorithms to solve more classical versions of the problem, this paper describes ways that organisations can drop the cost curve prior to applying an optimizing algorithm. This is done by classifying the techniques and giving examples from organizations which have faced serious smoothing problems. Other organizations can improve their cost performance by adopting some of these techniques.
