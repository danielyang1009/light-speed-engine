## 1. A Stochastic Response Model with Application to Brand Choice
### Author(s):
- David B. Montgomery
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model which is an extension of a class of stochastic response models first proposed by Coleman [Coleman, J. A. 1964a. Models of Change and Response Uncertainty. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.]. In its present form the model applies to the binary response situation. The model postulates a population of respondents who are heterogeneous with respect to their response probabilities. A given respondent may experience changes in his response probability in the intervals between response occasions, but since the actual responses he makes do not effect his response probability, the model is zero order. The paper also presents a variant of the minimum chi square procedure which may be used to estimate and test the model. An application to consumer brand choice data demonstrates that the model is empirically viable. Potential applications to multi-wave voting intentions panels and social-psychological experiments are indicated.

## 2. A Process Model of Budgeting in a Public School System
### Author(s):
- Donald Gerwin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the resource allocation process in public organizations. In particular, the operating budget of a large urban school system is investigated in an effort to discover the manner in which appropriation decisions are made. A computer simulation model is developed which consists of the sequence of operating procedures used by the school system's administrators in making their choices. The model consists of preliminary decisions on departmental requests, decisions on a general salary increase and new debt service, a comparison of revenue forecasts to total expenditures and processes to balance the budget by removing a deficit or distributing a surplus. Preliminary departmental appropriations are influenced by expectations of added revenues and the existence of an informal priority system. A general salary increase is budgeted as the result of a comparison of the existing salary structure with those of certain similar organizations. New debt service is influenced by the financial pressure exerted by the level of working capital in the bond fund. An important factor in removing a deficit is the attempt to use strategies which will not affect existing appropriations. Surpluses when they exist, are distributed in order to prevent certain pressures from building up. The predictions of the model are tested in so far as possible and a sensitivity analysis is conducted on certain parameters estimated from sparse data.

## 3. A Model of Rational Competitive Bidding
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Rothkopf
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
This paper presents a mathematical model of the bidding process that deals explicitly with the uncertainty of the bidders about the value of the subject of the auction. By dealing with this often ignored factor, it obtains equilibrium strategies and profits as a function of the number of bidders, the relative values they attach to the subject of the auction and their accuracy in estimating it. Models are developed for both highest-bid-wins and lowest-bid-wins auctions.

## 4. A Sampling Study of the Properties of Estimators of Transition Probabilities
### Author(s):
- T. C. Lee
- G. G. Judge
- R. L. Cain
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
In this paper, the sampling experiment approach is used to evaluate the performance of alternative estimators that may be employed to estimate the transition matrix for a Markov probability model when only the aggregated data, reflecting the proportion of the sample in each state over a sequence of trials, are known. In addition, the experiments provide some initial information relative to the sampling properties of restricted estimators when time series data are used.

## 5. Algorithms for Stochastic Games with Geometrical Interpretation
### Author(s):
- M. A. Pollatschek
- B. Avi-Itzhak
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
The paper presents a new approach, based on analysis and geometrical interpretation, to the solution of Markov stochastic games. The proposed algorithm, using iterations in policy space, turns out to be a Newton-Raphson type procedure. Several numerical examples are given, covering the terminating and non-terminating cases respectively and illustrating the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with other known algorithms. Special attention is given to Howard's sequential decision problem with discrete and continuous policy spaces.

## 6. Mathematical Programming with Increasing Constraint Functions
### Author(s):
- William P. Pierskalla
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
The mathematical programming problem—find a non-negative n-vector x which maximizes f(x) subject to the constraints gi(x) ≥ O, i = 1,…, m—is investigated where f(x) is assumed to be concave or pseudo-concave and the gi(x) are increasing functions. It is shown that under certain conditions on gi(x), the Kuhn-Tucker-Lagrange conditions are necessary and sufficient for the optimality of x*. It is also shown that the gi(x) are a useful class of functions since, among other properties, they are closed under non-negative addition, under the addition of any scalar, and under multiplication of non-negative members of the class.

## 8. Communications to the Editor—Competitive Bidding with Disparate Information
### Author(s):
- Robert B. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1969
### Abstract:
This paper analyses competitive bidding via sealed tenders for the case in which the bidders have different sources and amounts of information available about the value of the prize. The equilibrium pure strategies are characterized and computational methods are derived. A simple example is solved completely.
