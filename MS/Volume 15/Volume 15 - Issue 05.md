## 1. A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables
### Author(s):
- Frank M. Bass
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
A growth model for the timing of initial purchase of new products is developed and tested empirically against data for eleven consumer durables. The basic assumption of the model is that the timing of a consumer's initial purchase is related to the number of previous buyers. A behavioral rationale for the model is offered in terms of innovative and imitative behavior. The model yields good predictions of the sales peak and the timing of the peak when applied to historical data. A long-range forecast is developed for the sales of color television sets.

## 2. Monoextremal Representations of a Class of Minimax Problems
### Author(s):
- M. D. Canon
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
It is shown that minimax problems with convex-concave payoff and convex inequality constraints can be reduced to solving an equivalent constrained minimization problem. The objective function of the minimization problem is not convex, nor is the set of feasible solutions convex. Nevertheless, it is shown that any point which satisfies the first order necessary conditions for optimality must be a global minimum.

## 3. On a New Class of Combinatoric Optimizers for Multi-Product Single-Machine Scheduling
### Author(s):
- K. O. Kortanek
- W. L. Maxwell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
Many people have proposed objective functions, or optimizers, which guide one to schedule a multi-product single stage production system. In this paper we present a whole new class of optimizers, or solution concepts, which generalizes most of the well-known optimizers to date. Our combinatoric formulations are related to a new class of solution concepts for n-person games developed by Charnes-Kortanek [Charnes, A., K. O. Kortanek. 1967. On a class of convex and non-archimedean solution concepts for n-person games. Technical Report No. 22, Department of Operations Research, Cornell University, and Systems Research Memo No. 172, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, March.]. By constructing a combinatoric linear programming problem, where some of the variables are determined by an arbitrary set of permutations, we encompass classical optimizers in one formulation including such concepts as

## 4. Shortest Route Models for the Allocation of Inspection Effort on a Production Line
### Author(s):
- Leon S. White
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
Two shortest route models for determining where to allocate inspection effort on a production line are developed for the cases where this effort is unlimited or limited in its availability. A production line is defined as an ordered sequence of production stages, each stage consisting of a manufacturing operation followed by a potential inspection station. Items flow through the line in batches and may incur defects at any stage. Defects are assumed to be repairable or non-repairable. The defect generating process at any stage is taken to be an independent Bernoulli process with a known parameter. Two levels of inspection effort may be applied at any stage: no inspection or 100% inspection. Thus, both models are used to determine the stages at which batches are to be 100% inspected. A general cost structure is postulated first for the case where items with repairable defects are immediately repaired and items with non-repairable defects are discarded, and then for the case where all items found to be defective are replaced immediately with non-defectives. An expected cost per batch criterion is used to determine an optimal inspection plan in all cases. Examples are included.

## 5. Stock Rationing
### Author(s):
- Alan Kaplan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
A supplier may distinguish between the demands be receives for an item, attaching greater importance to satisfying some categories of demand than others. This paper discusses use of reserve levels, i. e, stock levels at which to stop issuing in response to lower priority demand. An algorithm which calculates optimum reserve levels is developed. Its effectiveness is compared to use of unsophisticated policies.

## 6. Extensions of the Planning Horizon Theorem in the Dynamic Lot Size Model
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Eppen
- F. J. Gould
- B. Peter Pashigian
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
This paper considers an N period production planning problem in which a sequence of known demands d1, d2,…, dN must be satisfied. The cost of production in period t consists of a setup cost Kt plus a marginal cost per unit ct. The cost of carrying a unit of inventory into period t is ht − 1. An optimal policy is a production plan that satisfies demand at minimum cost.

## 7. Optimal Continuous Review Policies for Two Product Inventory Systems with Joint Setup Costs
### Author(s):
- Edward Ignall
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
Minimum average cost ordering policies for continuously reviewed two product inventory systems with joint setup costs are sought. Disappointly, the optimal policy, even in a simple symmetric case, is not always simple: For some values of cost and demand parameters, a policy that would be difficult to implement is optimal. Markov Renewal Programming is used to find the region in parameter space where a given policy is optimal.

## 8. Optimality of Myopic Inventory Policies for Several Substitute Products
### Author(s):
- Edward Ignall
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
Multiproduct inventory systems with proportional ordering costs and stochastic demands are studied. New conditions are obtained under which a myopic ordering policy (a policy of minimizing expected cost in the current period alone) is optimal for a sequence of periods for all initial inventory levels. An important one of these, the substitute property, holds when the myopic policy is such that increasing the initial inventory of one product does not increase the quantity ordered of any product.

## 9. Observations & Opinions—Management Science and the Teaching of Management
### Author(s):
- Wayne A. Meinhart
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
How much management science should the curricula in our colleges of business administration contain? The hypothesis is advanced that the concept and content of management science should now receive maximal emphasis, and that non-management science courses which purport to teach “management” should be de-emphasized or eliminated. Such a proposition contains general implications for degree programs, course content, and organization structure within colleges of business administration.

## 10. Communications to the Editor—Exponential Forecasting: Some New Variations
### Author(s):
- Garth P. McCormick
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1969
### Abstract:
Exponential forecasting or smoothing models are presented which take into account all combinations of trend and cyclical effects in additive and multiplicative form. Although other authors have hinted that the proposed models existed, no one has ever presented them in comprehensive form. This paper presents the nine possible models in graphical form and summarizes them by one summary formula.
