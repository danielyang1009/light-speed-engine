## 3. Information Retrieval for Media Planning
### Author(s):
- Seymour M. Kwerel
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1968
### Abstract:
A critical problem, continually faced by managers in developing “effective” resource allocation plans, is that only limited partial information is available about the system under consideration on which to base these plans. This is particularly true in planning involving the limited information typically available on the relevant behavior and characteristics of large human populations.

## 4. A Simulation Model of Capital Budgeting Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1968
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation model of capital budgeting under uncertainty. It analyzes the effects of two types of uncertainty which influence the cash flows of the potential investment projects. Techniques of simulation and stochastic linear programming (using Weingartner's Basic Horizon model of capital budgeting) are employed to compute the expected return (with an associated measure of the risk involved) of different portfolios of projects. The manager can then select the portfolio which is closest to his personal risk-return preference. The model provides a practical guide to management in the entire process of project search, portfolio generation, and portfolio evaluation which characterizes the capital budgeting decision.

## 5. An Empirical Study of Computer Maintenance Policies
### Author(s):
- John I. S. Hsu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1968
### Abstract:
This paper reports the findings of the study of maintenance policies for the IBM 1620 system installed at the university's computing center. Three Maintenance policies were investigated by studying the operating characteristics of the system's two functional units, IBM 1620 Processor and IBM 1622 Card-Punch, covering the period of twenty-nine months. Cost minimization approach is used to determine the optimum policy among three alternatives. These three alternatives are: (1) repairs only; (2) scheduled maintenance at a time interval of t hours of operation without failure; (3) performing maintenance procedures at t, 2t, 3t,… regardless of intervening repairs.

## 6. An Approach to Linear Programming with 0–1 Variables
### Author(s):
- Shizuo Senju
- Yoshiaki Toyoda
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1968
### Abstract:
There are many decision making problems in which one seeks to choose the optimal package from a large number of indivisible independent proposals. For instance, jobbing firms have often to choose the most profitable package of orders from hundreds of potential ones under a great many restrictions on available resources, such as working time of different facilities, number of specialists, materials, etc. This article is intended to present a simple approach to obtaining approximate solutions for such problems. The fundamental concept is to make some ordinal scales among proposals. Steps of calculation are illustrated by examples of choosing the optimal mix of orders, one of which involves 60 candidate proposals with 30 restricting conditions. This method may be of great help when (1) the number of candidates and restricting conditions are large; (2) the estimated or raw data on required resources for proposals and their incremental profits contain some errors; and (3) the distribution of incremental profits and required resources of candidates differs greatly, say, week by week, and the limits on resources can be extended in a practical manner by carrying over an inventory of profitable backlog orders, reducing, in effect, the remaining capacity in the future week.

## 7. Note on “Maximizing Insurance Buyers' Utility”
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Hayes
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1968
### Abstract:
In an article entitled “Maximizing Insurance Buyers' Utility” (Management Science, February 1968), Morris Hamburg and William Matlack obtained results which suggested that-under certain rather stringent assumptions about an individual's utility function, the probability distribution of the possible losses he is exposed to, and the mechanism that determines the cost of insurance—not only is it advantageous for him to buy insurance, but the more insurance he buys (i.e., the higher he sets his liability limit) the more advantageous it becomes. On the surface it might appear that this intuitively appealing1 result should be true under less stringent conditions regarding the individual's utility function, and possibly that it might be true for concave utility in general. The purpose of this note is to show that not only is it not true in general for concave utility, it is not even true necessarily for the case considered by Hamburg and Matlack if the individual's total asset position, and the utility he assigns to total assets, is taken into consideration.
