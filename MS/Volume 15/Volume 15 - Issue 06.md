## 3. A Conceptual Framework for Urban Planning Models
### Author(s):
- Maurice D. Kilbridge
- Robert P. O'Block
- Paul V. Teplitz
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
The authors present a framework for the analysis of models which have been designed for, or used in, urban physical and economic planning. The models have been distinguished by their basic characteristics, rather than on the basis of their applications. Four basic characteristics are identified: (1) the subject of the model; (2) its function; (3) its underlying theory; and (4) its method. Besides providing a conceptual framework for the analysis and development of urban planning models, this conceptual scheme serves as the basis of a classification scheme which allows the study and comparison of existing models. Such a system is presented as an illustration of the process of model analysis using this conceptual framework.

## 5. Sixty Years of Queueing Theory
### Author(s):
- U. Narayan Bhat
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
Queueing Theory has been attacked on two fronts. Some theoreticians say that Queueing Theory is closed. Some practitioners feel that there is very little in it for use. In view of this, it seems that after six decades of development it is time for stock taking. It is hoped that a discussion of the problems, achievements and the shortcomings of Queueing Theory will be helpful for both theorists and practitioners by putting things in proper perspective.

## 6. Lease-Buy Planning Decisions
### Author(s):
- Paul A. Weekes
- John C. Chambers
- Satinder K. Mullick
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
A company with a long standing practice of leasing equipment may amass, over a period of time, a complicated structure of leasing arrangements, both long-term and short-term. Due to changes in costs of leasing, purchase prices, etc., there should be frequent evaluations of whether the existing strategy is optimal. The usual approach is to perform a “macro-steady-state” analysis, where cash flows and/or return-on-investment calculations are performed. However, some macro-analyses indicate only which choice is preferable and do not take into account either the possibility of a mixed strategy (own some and lease some) or implementation problems and the resulting costs that occur when converting from one system to another. Furthermore, if there is to be a conversion from leased to owned equipment, additional burdens will be placed on the maintenance department.

## 7. Does “Good Portfolio Management” Exist?
### Author(s):
- Julian L. Simon
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
Using closed-end investment trusts as subject-matter, this paper explores this question: Are some portfolio managers “really” better than others? i.e., are there differences in performance among managers other than those differences due to chance? It also throws some light on whether investors, in the aggregate, act rationally upon the knowledge of performance that is reasonably available to them in the pricing of securities.

## 8. Critique of: “Does ‘Good Portfolio Management’ Exist?”
### Author(s):
- John N. Barineau, III
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
Critique of the paper Simon, Julian L. 1969. Does “Good portfolio management” exist? Management Sci.15(6, February) B-308–B319. Professor Simon addresses two interesting questions on portfolio management and performance of closed-end investment trusts: 1. Do some trust managers actually “outperform” others, or is trust performance only the result of luck or chance? 2. Are the discounts (or premiums) represented in trust share prices in the open market valid indicators of future portfolio performance? Despite some interesting and creative research, the author's work, unfortunately, falls short of providing a really conclusive answer to the first and most important of these questions.

## 9. Critique of: “Does ‘Good Portfolio Management’ Exist?”
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Critique of the paper Simon, Julian L. 1969. Does “Good portfolio management” exist? Management Sci.15(6, February) B-308–B319. In this paper, the author has considered an interesting subject with results, however, that are admittedly inconclusive or even inconsistent. Unfortunately, the cause of such results appears to be due more to problems in research methodology than to unavoidable difficulties inherent in the subject matter.

## 10. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1969
### Abstract:
Not all companies can afford, nor do they need sophisticated computer systems. The need for systems is dependent upon the nature of the business and the technical progress that the individual company and industry has made. It is important to point out that to a large extent the transaction business of most companies has been computerized. All large companies have computerized payroll. Billing is a universally accepted application. Many companies keep a perpetual inventory as part of their transaction files and update their chart of accounts as part of a payments system. Although these are not exotic applications, they represent a first step and a base load of work that computers do well.
