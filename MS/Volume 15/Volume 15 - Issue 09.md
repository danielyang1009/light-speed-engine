## 1. On the use of Information Theory Concepts in the Analysis of Financial Statements
### Author(s):
- Henri Theil
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
Balance sheets and income statements are numerical decompositions of certain total sums: total assets, total liabilities, total sales, and total costs and expenses. The behavior of individual items measured as fractions of the corresponding total is important for the analysis of the company's financial position. It will be argued in this article that certain concepts derived from information theory are useful as summarizing descriptive devices for changes in such fractions as well as for the analysis of differences between companies of the same industry.

## 2. Integer Linear Programming: A Study in Computational Efficiency
### Author(s):
- C. A. Trauth, Jr.
- R. E. Woolsey
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
In this report, twenty-nine integer linear programming problems, raging from very simple to apparently rather difficult, are introduced. The results of running these problems on four different computer codes, involving five distinct algorithms, are presented as both time and iteration data. A brief description of the codes used is also included.

## 3. Discrete Dynamic Programming and Capital Allocation
### Author(s):
- G. L. Nemhauser
- Z. Ullmann
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
Dynamic programming algorithms are developed for optimal capital allocation subject to budget constraints. We extend the work of Weingartner [Weingartner, H. M. 1966. Capital budgeting of interrelated projects: Survey and synthesis. Management Sci.12(7, March) 485–516.] and Weingartner and Ness [Weingartner, H. M., D. N. Ness. 1967. Methods for the solution of the multi-dimensional 0/1 knapsack problem. Oper. Res.15(1, January–February) 83–108.] by including multilevel projects, reinvesting returns, borrowing and lending, capital deferrals, and project interactions. We are able to handle dynamic programming models with several state variables because the optimal returns are monotone non-decreasing step functions. Computational experience with a variety of problems is reported.

## 4. A Backlogging Model and a Multi-Echelon Model of a Dynamic Economic Lot Size Production System—A Network Approach
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
Two dynamic economic lot size production systems are analyzed in this paper, the first being a single product model with backlogging and the second a multi-echelon model. In each model the objective is to find a production schedule that minimizes the total production and inventory costs.

## 5. Time Delay in Minimax Optimization of Unimodal Functions of One Variable
### Author(s):
- John H. Beamer
- Douglass J. Wilde
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
A minimax search plan is developed for locating the maximum of a one dimensional unimodal function when a time delay occurs between the placement of an experiment and the result. The optimal search plans, among all the plans which place only one experiment at each unit of time, are determined for time delays of one and two periods. These plans are optimal in the sense that for a required final interval of uncertainty, they have the largest possible starting interval. Discrete variable (lattice) versions of these plans are also given, as well as plans for when the number of experiments is unknown initially. When more than one experiment can be made at each unit of time, a variant of block search is more efficient.

## 6. Dual Programming Problems as Hemi-Games
### Author(s):
- Enrique Cansado
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
It is proposed here a new and unifying formal framework for duality in optimization problems, relating more closely programs to games, by means of the concepts of “hemi-games” and “quasi-duality”. A new generalization of the idea of La-grange multipliers is also presented.

## 7. An Algorithm for Separable Nonconvex Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- James E. Falk
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 May 1969
### Abstract:
In this paper we present an algorithm for solving mathematical programming problems of the form: Find x = (x1,…, xn) to minimize ∑φi(xi) subject to x ∈ G and l ≤ x ≤ L. Each φi is assumed to be lower semicontinuous, possibly nonconvex, and G is assumed to be closed. The algorithm is of the branch and bound type and solves a sequence of problems in each of which the objective function is convex. These problems correspond to successive partitions of the feasible set. Two different rules for refining the partitions are considered; these lead to convergence of the algorithm under different requirements on the problem functions. Examples are given, and computational considerations are discussed.
