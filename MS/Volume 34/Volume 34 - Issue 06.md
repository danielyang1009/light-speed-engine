## 1. Decision Analysis: Practice and Promise
### Author(s):
- Ronald A. Howard
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
Decision analysis stands on a foundation of hundreds of years of philosophical and practical thought about uncertainty and decision-making. The accomplishments and promise of the field are impressive, yet it has not become commonplace even in very important decisions. While human nature may pose an ultimate limitation, maintaining clarity of concept and exploiting progress in the realms of scope, skill, and efficiency should lead to more widespread use.

## 2. Blacklisting Social Science Departments with Poor Ph.D. Submission Rates
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
In an attempt to reduce the time taken by social science Ph.D. candidates to obtain their degrees, the Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC) of the United Kingdom has decided to withhold funds from social science departments of academic institutions with the poorest Ph.D. submission rates. Institutions with less than one in ten of their Ph.D. students submitting a thesis within four years of registration will be placed on a blacklist. In interpreting the observed submission rates the ESRC appears not to have taken account of the different numbers of registered students in social science departments, which have cohort sizes ranging from 2 to 79. This failure has potentially counter-productive consequences. An empirical Bayes method is proposed that adjusts estimates of submission rates by taking into account the number of students. The method suggests that differences in true unobservable submission rates between institutions are small and thus observable submission proportions alone do not form a good basis for policy action.

## 3. Competitive Maps: The Structure Underlying Asymmetric Cross Elasticities
### Author(s):
- Lee G. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
A special case of three-mode factor analysis is used to portray the systematic structure underlying asymmetric cross elasticities for a broad class of market-share attraction models. Analysis of the variation over retail outlets and weeks reveals competitive patterns corresponding to sales for the major brands in the market as well as patterns reflecting shelf-price competition. Analysis of the brand domain results in a joint space. One set of brand positions portrays how brands exert influence over the competition. The other set of points portrays how brands are influenced by others. The interset distances (angles) provide direct measures of competitive pressures. Maps are formed as spatial representations of each of the competitive patterns discovered.

## 4. Game-Theoretic Optimal Portfolios
### Author(s):

- Thomas M. Cover
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
We show, for a wide variety of payoff functions, that the expected log optimal portfolio is also game theoretically optimal in a single play or in multiple plays of the stock market. Thus there is no essential conflict between good short-term and long-run performance. Both are achieved by maximizing the conditional expected log return.

## 5. Forecasting with a Repeat Purchase Diffusion Model
### Author(s):
- Ambar G. Rao

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
A methodology for forecasting the sales of an ethical drug as a function of marketing effort before any sales data are available and for updating the forecast with a few periods of sales data is presented. Physicians' perceptions of the drug on a number of attributes, e.g. effectiveness, range of ailments for which appropriate, frequency of prescriptions, are used to estimate the parameters of a model originally proposed by Lilien, Rao and Kalish (Lilien, G. L., A. G. Rao, S. Kalish. 1981. Bayesian estimation and control of detailing effort in a repeat purchase diffusion environment. Management Sci.27(May) 493506.). This model conceptualizes the drug adoption process as a repeat purchase diffusion model; sales are expressed as a function of a drug's own and competitive marketing efforts and of word of mouth. The model is first validated in this paper via predictive testing on 19 drugs prescribed by three types of physicians. The forecasting methodology is illustrated using physicians' perceptions on these drugs. Forecasts obtained without any sales data, and updated forecasts using seven periods of sales data are presented, and are encouraging.

## 6. Component Commonality with Service Level Requirements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
This paper extends recent results of Baker et al. (Baker, K. R., M. J. Magazine, H. L. W. Nuttle. 1986. The effect of commonality on safety stocks in a simple inventory model. Management Sci.32 982988.) in understanding the impact of component commonality on stocking levels under service level constraints. A model is formulated for an arbitrary number of products with general joint demand distribution. The results obtained are not all intuitive. While utilizing commonality is beneficial, nothing general can be said about the resulting change in the components' stock levels. When the cost structure is of a particular simple form, though, some interesting general patterns do emerge. We also discuss the case of using a service-level measure where rationing of common components might be required, and characterize the implied rationing rule.

## 7. A Continuous Review Model for an Inventory System with Two Supply Modes
### Author(s):
- Kamran Moinzadeh
- Steven Nahmias
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop an approximate model of an inventory control system in which there exist two options for resupply, with one having a shorter lead time. Because the optimal policy appears to be extremely complex, we consider a reasonable extension of the standard (Q, R) policy to allow for two different lot sizes Q1 and Q2, and two different reorder levels, R1 and R2. Expressions for the expected on hand inventory and the expected backorders are developed and a procedure for determining the policy parameters is given. The model is validated by simulation, and calculations are included which compare the average annual cost with and without emergency ordering.

## 8. A Transportation Problem in Which Costs Depend on the Order of Arrival
### Author(s):
- Eric V. Denardo
- Uriel G. Rothblum
- Arthur J. Swersey
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
This paper describes a problem in which the cost of satisfying the demand at a particular location is a weighted average of the travel times for the items that are supplied. The greatest weight is given to the first-arriving item, with decreasing weights given to each succeeding item. In the case of known demand, the problem is transformed into an equivalent transportation problem. In the case of stochastic demand, the problem is transformed into a transportation problem whose objective is to minimize the sum of a linear function and a convex function of the sum of the flows on selected arcs. This problem is linearized by substituting for the convex function the product of a parameter and a linear term. The parameterized problem is solved by parametric linear programming and by updating the slope.

## 9. A Comparison of Two Elicitation Methods for a Prior Distribution for a Binomial Parameter
### Author(s):
- Umesh Gavasakar
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
This paper compares two methods of elicitation for the hyperparameters of the conjugate beta distribution for a binomial sampling model. The PM (posterior mode) method of Chaloner and Duncan appears to be more sensitive to elicitation errors than does a new method proposed here. This new method uses the device of imaginary results, due to I. J. Good (Good, I. J. 1967. A Bayesian significance test for multinomial distributions. JRSSB29 399431 (with discussion).). An explicit model for elicitation errors is used in a simulation.

## 10. Periodic Versus Can-Order Policies for Coordinated Multi-Item Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Derek R. Atkins
- Paul O. Iyogun
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
The coordinated multi-item inventory problem refers to the problem of managing inventories where there is a joint fixed cost for replenishing plus an item-by-item fixed cost for each item included in the replenishment order. Given that the optimal solution is likely to be too complex, attention has focused on fixed heuristics, and in particular can-order or (s, c, S) policies. This paper makes two contributions. First, a new lower bound on the cost of the optimal policy is proposed in order that the performance of heuristics may be measured. Second, motivated by the lower bound, a simple periodic policy is proposed and shown to be an improvement over can-order policies for many data sets.

## 11. The Value of Pre-Decision Side Bets for Utility Maximizers
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1988
### Abstract:
If an alternative is attractive only at certain wealth levels of a decision maker, typically above some critical level, then there will be occasions when it is better to enter into an independent side bet prior to making a decision, than to accept or reject the alternative outright.
