### Published:

### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to compare the abilities of two competing analytical techniquesmathematical programming and statistical regressionto shed light on the union/nonunion productivity differential in U.S. surface coal mining. The programming approach has the virtues of being nonparametric (and thus extremely flexible) and of being able to provide a decomposition of productivity differentials into three componentsdifferences in technical efficiency, differences in scale efficiency, and differences in congestion. Identification of these three components provides an aid to management in its search for the sources of, and remedies for, productivity gaps. The econometric approach, on the other hand, is neither flexible nor does it provide such a decomposition; its chief virtue lies in the fact that, being stochastic, it allows for the presence of noise and measurement error that plagues most if not all empirical data. Thus, the two approaches have complementary virtues.

## 2. Financial Planning Where the Firm's Demand for Funds is Nonstationary and Stochastic
### Author(s):
- John D. Martin

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
The incentive for a firm to engage in planning (prearranging) for its future financing derives from the interaction of uncertainty concerning the amount and timing of future needs and the cost of negotiating and terminating contracts in capital markets. Three conditions on relative costs and probability distributions are identified under which no financial slack should be raised. If those conditions are not met, then under one set of reasonable assumptions the optimum amount of slack will be more than the largest possible future need. The model allows for surprises which can cause upward or downward (in contrast to EOQ models) revisions in the future regarding the optimal level of slack to continue to carry.

## 3. Estimation Risk and Incentive Contracts for Portfolio Managers
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The fiduciary relationship between portfolio managers and the investors they represent may be viewed as a principal-agent relationship, and therefore we have used the methodology from the agency literature in economics and finance to study the impact of existing compensation arrangements on the conflicts of interest between these two groups. In this paper we employ the assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and of estimation risk concerning beta to develop a model in which portfolio managers can, through effort, choose the parameters of the beta distribution. Our model entails moral hazard because the investor cannot observe the manager's action. Given certain utility functions we show that the presence of estimation risk leads the manager to choose a lower beta portfolio than otherwise and that no first best optimal contract exists. We also show that managerial divergent behavior is related to the divergence in risk preferences between the manager and the investor. By making slightly more stringent assumptions about preferences, we show that there exist some conditions under which the manager will provide more effort but also a riskier portfolio than the investor prefers. Finally we show that the investor will prefer a manager who is less risk averse than the investor.

## 4. Rethinking the Product Portfolio: A Generalized Investment Model
### Author(s):
- Timothy M. Devinney
- David W. Stewart
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
A generalized financial/product portfolio theory is developed, based on the underlying economic factors determining product profitability and risk, for applications involving the firm's product investment decisions. The model developed provides a means for differentiating market related risk and return from firm specific risk and return for each product. Two hypothetical illustrations of the model are described and the managerial implications are discussed.

## 5. Strategies for the Probabilistic Lot-Sizing Problem with Service-Level Constraints
### Author(s):
- James H. Bookbinder
- Jin-Yan Tan
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
We formulate a stochastic-demand version of the single-stage lot-sizing problem with time-varying demand, incorporating a service-level constraint on the probability of a stockout. Three strategies are studied. The static uncertainty strategy, in which lot-sizing decisions for every period must be made at the beginning of period 1, is shown to yield an equivalent deterministic problem with time-varying demands for which optimal or good heuristic solutions exist. The procedure by which this equivalent problem is obtained is computationally simple.

## 6. On a Possible Benefit to Bid Takers from Using Multi-Stage Auctions
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
Each year, multi-stage auctions of one form or another sell or let billions of dollars worth of goods and contracts. Yet despite the significance of such auctions, the existing theory of auctions and competitive bidding fails to explain why a bid taker might prefer a multi-stage auction to a, possibly simpler, single-stage mechanism. In fact, the existing theory tends to overlook multi-stage mechanisms altogether.

## 7. M/G/c Queueing Systems with Multiple Customer Classes: Characterization and Control of Achievable Performance Under Nonpreemptive Priority Rules
### Author(s):
- A. Federgruen
- H. Groenevelt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
This paper considers an M/G/c queueing system serving a finite number (J) of distinct customer classes. Performance of the system, as measured by the vector of steady-state expected waiting times of the customer classes (the performance vector), may be controlled by adopting an appropriate priority discipline.

## 8. A One-Sided Double Screening Procedure Using Individual Unit Misclassification Error
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1988
### Abstract:
A double screening procedure (DSP), which controls for individual unit misclassification error (IME) as well as average outgoing quality (AOQ), for quality control applications is developed. Screening involves selecting items whose performance is within specifications based on observing one or more correlated surrogate (screening) variables in lieu of the performance variable directly. In double screening, two screening variables, which are correlated to a performance variable, are observed sequentially, rather than simultaneously as in a single screening plan (SSP); namely, (l) one screening variable is used first to make one of three decisionsaccept, reject, or undecidedaccording to the magnitude of the individual nonconforming probability (equivalent to the IME for an accepted item); (2) after this first screening, the second screening variable is employed to screen the undecided items. Assuming conditions of normality, formulae for computing the selection ratio (proportion of accepted items) and AOQ are derived for a DSP. The impact of the intercorrelation between two screening variables on the sequencing of a DSP and the performance between an SSP versus DSP are examined. A DSP reduces inspection cost considerably relative to an SSP employing two screening variables. Producer's risk is also diminished at a nominal sacrifice in consumer's risk. Implementation of a DSP requires only the use of several simple formulas and readily available standard normal tables.
