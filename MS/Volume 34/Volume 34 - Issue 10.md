## 1. The Speed and Cost of Industrial Innovation in Japan and the United States: External vs. Internal Technology
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
This study, based on detailed data obtained from carefully selected samples of about 200 Japanese and American firms, seems to be the first comprehensive empirical investigation of the differences between Japan and the United States in innovation cost and time. Whereas the Japanese have substantial advantages in this regard in some industries (notably machinery), they do not seem to have any substantial advantage in others (notably chemicals). Whereas they have great advantages in carrying out innovations based on external technology, they do not seem to have any in carrying out innovations based on internal technology. Japanese firms allocate their resources quite differently than do American firms, a larger percentage of total innovation cost being devoted to tooling and manufacturing equipment and facilities, a smaller percentage being devoted to marketing startup. A large part of America's problem in this regard seems to be due to its apparent inability to match Japan as a quick and effective user of external technology.

## 2. Comparative Invention Performance of Major Industrial Countries: Patterns and Explanations
### Author(s):
- Hans H. Glismann
- Ernst-Jrgen Horn
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
The paper presents an analysis of invention performance, as measured by patenting activities, of six countries (France, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, USSR, West Germany) relative to the United States for 41 SIC industries over the past 20 years. It turns out that non-U.S. countries as a group have increased their (relative) invention performance in all fields of technology, including high technology fields. In a second step hypotheses which can be supposed to explain the relative decline of the United States' patenting activities are discussed and tested. There is strong evidence that catching up processes contributed most to the relative decrease of the United States; there is only little evidence that government interventions regarding research and development activities have had counterproductive effects on invention performance.

## 3. The Adoption of the M-Form Organizational Structure: A Test of Imitation Hypothesis
### Author(s):
- Vijay Mahajan
- Subhash Sharma
- Richard A. Bettis
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
The study of organizational adoption of administrative innovations has been generally guided by the imitation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that, within a relevant population of firms, an innovation is first adopted by a select few innovators who communicate and influence others to adopt it resulting in a predictable diffusion pattern. Using data on the adoption of the M-form organizational structure, this paper reexamines this hypothesis. Based on the reported results, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that organizational adoption of administrative innovations is characterized by a white-noise process. This result brings into question the appropriateness of the imitation hypothesis. Limitations and implications of the results are discussed.

## 4. Reduced System Algorithms for Markov Chains
### Author(s):
- Ram Lal
- U. Narayan Bhat
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
A reduced system is a smaller system derived in the process of analyzing a larger system. In solving for steady state probabilities of a Markov chain, generally the solution can be found by first solving a reduced system of equations which is obtained by appropriately partitioning the transition probability (or rate) matrix. Following Lal (Lal, R. 1981. A unified study of algorithms for steady state probabilities in Makov chains. Ph.D. Dissertation, Department of Operations Research and Engineering Management, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275.), a Markov chain can be categorized as standard or nonstandard depending on the location of an invertible submatrix necessary for an efficient solution in a transition probability (or rate) matrix. In this paper, algorithms for the determination of steady state probabilities are developed by using (i) a backward recursion which is efficient for standard systems and (ii) a forward recursion which is efficient for nonstandard systems. It is also shown that the backward recursion can be used for finding the first passage time distribution and its mean and variance.

## 5. Multiple Shift Workforce Lower Bounds
### Author(s):
- Gerald J. Koop
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
Previous lower bounds on workforce size have been derived from the consideration that the number of working shifts which can be provided by the workers over a given period of time must be at least as large as the number of working shifts required by the staffing demands over that period. None of those bounds incorporates the effect of constraints on the changing of shifts in a multiple shift manpower scheduling problem. This paper utilizes a network model of the problem to model its multiple shift aspect and provide new lower bounds on workforce size. For some common special cases of constraints these lower bounds can be calculated by band. For some common special cases of demands the multiple shift lower bounds degenerate to the single shift lower bounds.

## 6. Event Graph Modelling for Simulation with an Application to Flexible Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- Robert G. Sargent
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
This paper contains numerous extensions and refinements to event graphs which were recently introduced by Schruben for simulation modelling. These new results are integrated with Schruben's work to present a complete description of event graphs and their analysis. A (simple) flexible manufacturing system is modelled via event graphs to illustrate event graph modelling and analysis.

## 7. Managerial Influence in the Implementation of New Technology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
In the implementation of an organizational innovation, managers are usually presumed to influence the extent to which the innovation is adopted and used by their subordinates. However, the findings presented in this paper suggest that the managerial influence is not equally perceived by all subordinates. Rather, certain context-specific characteristics of individual employees mediate the managerial influence. Users of the expert system studied herein who were low in personal innovativeness toward this class of innovations, for whom the subjective importance of the task being computerized was low, whose task-related skills were low or who were low performers in their sales joball these user groups perceived their management had encouraged them to adopt. In contrast, users who rated high on any of these measures did not perceive any management influence in their adoption decision. Moreover, although access to the innovation was in fact highly similar for all users, high performers also were inclined to perceive the system as more accessible than were low performers. These findings suggest that the diffusion of an innovation within an organization perhaps could be viewed as a two-step managerial process. Employees whose characteristics incline them to adopt an innovation will do so without management support or urging if it is simply made available. Employees low on these characteristics will await a managerial directive before adopting. Implications for future research are discussed.

## 8. The Generalized Stein/Rubinstein Covariance Formula and Its Application to Estimate Real Systematic Risk
### Author(s):

- Cheng F. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
This paper generalizes Stein's (Stein, C. 1973. Estimation of the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. Proc. Prague Sympos. Asymptotic Statistics, September 1973.), Rubinstein's (Rubinstein, M. 1973b. A comparative static analysis of risk premiums. J. Bus.46(October) 604615; Rubinstein, M. 1976. The valuation of uncertain income streams and pricing of options. Bell J. Econom. Management Sci.7(Autumn) 407425.), and Losq and Chateau's (Losq, E., J. P. D. Chateau. 1982. A generalization of the CAPM based on a property of covariance operator. J. Financial and Quant. Anal.17(December) 783797.) covariance formula to the case where both variables are functions of multivariate normal random variables. The resulting formula is extremely useful for either implicit functions of, or nonpolynomials of, multivariate normal random variables, such as exponential functions. An application of the use of the generalized Stein/Rubinstein covariance formula to the estimation of real systemic risk is provided to illustrate the results.

## 9. NoteCan a Reduction in Set Up Costs Indeed Increase Total Costs?
### Author(s):
- Yigal Gerchak
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1988
### Abstract:
Zangwill (Zangwill, W. I. 1987. From EOQ towards ZI. Management Sci.33 12091223.) has constructed an example which purports to show that reducing set up costs can increase total cost. We show that this happened as a result of restricting the policies to be of a greedy nature. The expected cost of truly optimal policies is shown not to increase.

### Abstract:
Gerchak's note further elaborates on an example in my paper From EOQ Towards ZI (Zangwill, W. I. 1987. From EOQ towards ZI. Management Sci.33 12091223.). My example is correct. His example is correct also, and I was aware of examples of his type when I wrote the paper as were the referees when they reviewed it. His example makes several additional assumptions which totally change the situation and indeed the viewpoint of reality.
