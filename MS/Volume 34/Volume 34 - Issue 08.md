## 1. Optimal Strategic Pricing of Reproducible Consumer Products

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the strategic pricing of consumer durable products which can be acquired through either purchase or reproduction (e.g., computer software). As copy piracy results in an opportunity loss, its adverse effect on profits needs to be incorporated in strategic decisions such as pricing. Using a dual diffusion model which parsimoniously describes sales and copying, and employing control theory methodology, optimal price trajectories are derived for the period of monopoly. The results indicate that (a) in absence of any protection, skimming pricing strategies are generally optimal, and (b) copy protection is warranted only when sales diffuse much faster than copying and the protection technology does not significantly raise the marginal production cost.

## 2. Determining Optimal Reorder Intervals in Capacitated Production-Distribution Systems
### Author(s):

- William L. Maxwell
- John A. Muckstadt
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
The problem of determining consistent and realistic reorder intervals in complex production-distribution environments was formulated as a large scale, nonlinear, integer programming problem by Maxwell and Muckstadt (Maxwell, W. L., J. A. Muckstadt. 1985. Establishing consistent and realistic reorder intervals in production-distribution systems. Oper. Res.33(6, NovemberDecember) 13161341.). They show how the special structure of the problem permits its solution by a standard network flow algorithm. In this paper, we review the Maxwell-Muckstadt model, provide necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize the solution, and show that the optimal partition of nodes in the production-distribution network is invariant to an arbitrary scaling of the set-up and holding cost parameters. We consider two capacitated versions of the model: one with a single constrained work center, and the other with multiple constrained work centers. For single constraint problems, the invariance corollary provides a simple closed-form solution. For the multiple work center problem, the invariance corollary is exploited in the development of a Lagrange multiplier method of solution. The technique is illustrated by means of a small example problem and a problem taken from a real industrial setting.

### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Some sharp bounds and simple approximations are obtained for the Erlang delay formula and for the Erlang loss formula. One of the results is then used to get a simple analytical solution for the Server Allocation Problem.

## 4. A Nonlinear Optimization Model of Water Allocation for Hydroelectric Energy Production and Irrigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
An optimal decision and control model was developed and used for dual purpose allocation of water from a reservoir. The model was constructed for the Hazbani-Dan Water System in the Upper Galilee (Israel). In this system about half of the Dan River water enters and is stored in a reservoir and is then released via a 70 pipe either to a hydroelectric power station or to agricultural fields for irrigation. The electricity generated is sold to the national electricity utility according to a three-tiered pricing system which is a function of the time in the day and the season.

## 5. Joint Determination of Optimal Inventory and Quality Control Policy
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Peters
- Helmut Schneider
- Kwei Tang
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
Typically the operating policy for the inventory control system for a commodity is developed independent of the operating policy for the quality control system for that commodity and vice versa. In many circumstances, these systems are dependent on one another. A cost model that combines a fixed order quantity inventory control system with a Bayesian quality control system for a lot-by-lot attribute acceptance sampling plan is presented along with an algorithm to obtain the operating parameters for the combined systems. Behavior of the combined systems is investigated, and the costs and operating policy determined using this model are compared with the costs and operating policy determined when there is no integration of the two systems and when there is partial integration of the two systems. There are significant cost savings obtained by using the operating policy developed under the combined systems over the operating policy derived from the separate systems.

## 6. Lagrangian Relaxation Methods for Solving the Minimum Fleet Size Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of finding the minimum number of vehicles required to visit once a set of nodes subject to time window constraints, for a homogeneous fleet of vehicles located at a common depot. This problem can be formulated as a network flow problem with additional time constraints.

## 7. NoteOn the Minimum of a Nonconvex Inventory Function
### Author(s):
- Chandrasekhar Das
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
The paper deals with a nonconvex, bivariate minimization problem arising in a heuristic inventory model of Hadley and Whitin (Hadley, G., T. M. Whitin. 1963. Analysis of Inventory Systems. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ.). An approach is suggested whereby the existence and uniqueness of the solution can be determined even though the model does not fulfill the standard second-order conditions. It is observed that the global minimum for this model can be identified by means of the first-order conditions and the shape of the lead time demand distribution. In particular, the local minimum is also the global minimum for this model when lead time demand distribution is either unimodal or J-shaped.

## 8. NoteOn Making the Illustration Illustrative: A Comment on Banker, Conrad and Strauss
### Author(s):
- Richard G. Frank
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
Hospitals are firms which produce multiple outputs. Taking account of the multiproduct nature of the firm is important for appropriate analyses of hospital technology to be conducted. This paper comments on a recent study which was aimed at comparing two methods of analyzing hospital costs which incorporate multiple outputs and inputs. The comment focuses on how outputs are defined and problems related to aggregation of outputs. Limitations on the ability to interpret results reported by Banker, Conrad and Strauss are identified.

## 9. NoteA Note on Including Ordinal Relations Among Multipliers in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Boaz Golany
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1988
### Abstract:
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) evaluates the efficiency of Decision Making Units without imposing a priori weights on the input and output dimensions involved. This Note extends DEA to situations where ordinal relations among weights corresponding to certain dimensions exist. The extended model is reduced to the original DEA formulation where some of the input and output factors are accumulated. An illustrative example is provided and potential areas of applications are pointed out.
