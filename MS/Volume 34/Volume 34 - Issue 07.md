## 1. Defensive Marketing Strategies: An Equilibrium Analysis Based on Decoupled Response Function Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
The entry of a new product (attacker) into a competitive market is likely to provoke responses from some or all of the existing products (defenders). This paper investigates the development of optimal defensive strategies based on an understanding of the possible reactions of all the defenders to an optimal attack. Following Lane (Lane, W. J. 1980. Product differentiation in a market with endogenous sequential entry. Bell J. Econom.11(1, Spring) 237260.) we assume that N products each enter sequentially with perfect foresight on subsequent entry. Then, based on new technology, an unanticipated attacker enters. The N defenders respond in price but not position according to Lane's model. Once this equilibrium is obtained, advertising and distribution response functions scale sales.

## 2. Strategic Decision Processes in High Velocity Environments: Four Cases in the Microcomputer Industry
### Author(s):
- L. J. Bourgeois, III
- Kathleen M. Eisenhardt
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
How do executives make strategic decisions in industries where the rate of technological and competitive change is so extreme that market information is often unavailable or obsolete, where strategic windows are opening and shutting quickly, and where the cost of error is involuntary exit? How do top management teams divide the decision making responsibility? And how is risk of strategic error mitigated? What we report here is a set of hypotheses induced from a field investigation of four microcomputer firms, where we studied how each of the top management teams went about making major decisions. Our goal was to extend prior work on strategic decision making to what we term high velocity environments. Our results consist of a set of paradoxes which the successful firms resolve and the unsuccessful firms do not. We found an imperative to make major decisions carefully, but to decide quickly; to have a powerful, decisive CEO and a simultaneously powerful top management team; to seek risk and innovation, but to execute a safe, incremental implementation. Despite the apparent paradox, effective firms do all of these simultaneously. These paradoxes are presented in the form of propositions and testable hypotheses.

## 3. An Additive Group Utility for a Fund Manager
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Bordley
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
The additive utility formula developed by Harsanyi specifies how a rational ethical individual acting on behalf of other people ought to behave. Unfortunately the formula is not invariant to arbitrary utility transformations and hence requires interpersonal comparisons of utility. Many economists have also attacked the formula on ethical grounds.

## 4. Algorithms for Scheduling a Single Machine to Minimize the Weighted Number of Late Jobs
### Author(s):
- C. N. Potts
- L. N. Van Wassenhove
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of scheduling n jobs, each having a processing time, a due date and a weight, on a single machine to minimize the weighted number of late jobs. An O(n log n) algorithm is given for solving the linear programming problem obtained by relaxing the integrality constraints in a zero-one programming formulation of the problem. This linear programming lower bound is used in a reduction algorithm that eliminates jobs from the problem. Also, a branch and bound algorithm that uses the linear programming lower bound is proposed. Computational results with branch and bound algorithms that use this and other lower bounds and with a dynamic programming algorithm for problems with up to 1000 jobs are given.

## 5. Mitigating End Effects in the Dynamic Vehicle Allocation Model
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Hughes
- Warren B. Powell
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
A class of network models developed for optimizing the use of a fleet of vehicles can be viewed as time-staged optimization models. Such models which have linear objective functions suffer particularly from end effects, the distortions introduced by employing a finite planning horizon. This paper brings together the end effects literature and the vehicle allocation literature to find a finite linear programming problem that gives an approximation to the first stage optimal solution of the infinite model. In addition, we develop another method of approximation and show that both methods can be formulated as generalized networks. Numerical results are presented for each method for comparison.

## 6. Stock Allocation in a Two-Echelon Distribution System Or What to Do Until Your Ship Comes In
### Author(s):
- Peter L. Jackson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
In this paper, we focus on a single order cycle of a warehouse, serving N retailers where the only shipments allowed during the cycle are from the warehouse to the retailers. For a simple ship-up-to-S allocation policy, we develop both the exact cost model and a computationally tractable approximate cost model for the case of identical retailers, and demonstrate empirically the benefits of centralizing at least a portion of the total system stock.

## 7. The Siting of Emergency Service Facilities with Workload Capacities and Backup Service
### Author(s):
- Hasan Pirkul
- David A. Schilling
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
By the very nature of the demand that they serve, emergency service systems require that timely service be readily available to those who need it. Yet, the distinct possibility exists that the closest facility will be occupied with another call for service, and when this primary responding unit is busy, a secondary or backup facility must be assigned. The need for backup service is most prevalent in heavily used systems, which are also prone to facility workloads that can be excessive if uncontrolled. The effective design of these systems should address the siting of both the primary responding facility and a designated backup unit, as well as reasonable workload limits on these facilities.

## 8. NoteWhen Does Lag Structure Really Matter  Indeed?
### Author(s):
- Alain Bultez
- Philippe Naert
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
Magat et al. (Magat, W. A., J. M. McCann, R. C. Morey. 1986. When does lag structure really matter in optimizing advertising expenditures? Management Sci.32(February) 182193.) have correctly pointed out that a high sales elasticity to advertising adds to the flatness of the advertiser's profit objective. Quite consistently, apparently, they deduce that when the goodwill elasticity is huge, as with the famous Lydia Pinkham's vegetable compound, the misidentification of the distribution of advertising dynamic effects should hardly hit the advertiser's performance. But building on their approach, we show here it is just in such cases that the misspecification of the lag pattern is likely to cause the most severe damages. As those losses appear small, we persist in believing that econometric sophistication of lag structures may not pay much.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1988
### Abstract:
Bultez and Naert (Bultez, A. V., P. A. Naert. 1988. When does lag structure really matter  indeed? Management Sci.34(July).) provide an analytical example and several simulations that show profits to be more sensitive to advertising lag structure misspecification the higher the advertising goodwill elasticity. We explain how this result is consistent with our (Magat, McCann, and Morey [Magat, W. A., J. M. McCann, R. C. Morey. 1986. When does lag structure really matter in optimizing advertising expenditures? Management Sci.32(February) 182193.]) result that a given amount of advertising error induced by misspecification causes greater reductions in profits the lower the advertising goodwill elasticity. We also use their simulation results to identify the pattern of prior advertising used in estimation as an important determinant of when misspecification matters in estimating advertising lag structures.
