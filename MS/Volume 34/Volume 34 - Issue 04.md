## 1. The Effects of Splitting Attributes on Weights in Multiattribute Utility Measurement
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This study examined how weights in multiattribute utility measurement change when objectives are split into more detailed levels. Subjects were asked to weight attributes in value trees containing three objectives which were specified by either three, four, five, or six attributes. The robust finding was that the more detailed parts of the value tree were weighted significantly higher than the less detailed ones. This overweighting bias was found for several weighting techniques, but the techniques that used holistic judgments to derive weights were affected somewhat less than techniques that used decomposed attribute weights. This bias is interpreted in terms of the increased salience and availability of attributes that are spelled out in more detail.

## 2. Mean Lower Partial Moment Valuation and Lognormally Distributed Returns
### Author(s):
- Wayne Y. Lee
- Ramesh K. S. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a capital asset pricing model in a mean lower partial moment framework. Specifically, we show that when partial moments are computed about the expected risky portfolio return, optimal portfolio choice in a mean lower partial framework permits a two-fund portfolio separation between a riskless asset and a market portfolio of risky assets. In this new framework, risk is measured as semideviation (for second degree stochastic dominance), and semivariance (for third degree stochastic dominance). Further, when security returns are lognormally distributed and small risk, this new mean lower partial moment valuation specializes to the mean-logarithmic variance capital asset pricing model.

## 3. Dominance Conditions for Multivariate Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Marco Scarsini
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
Stochastic dominance conditions are given for n-variate utility functions, when k-variate risk aversion is assumed for k = 1, 2, , n. These conditions are expressed through a comparison of distribution functions, as in the well-known univariate case, and through a comparison of random variables defined on the same probability space.

## 4. A Study of User Interface Aids for Model-Oriented Decision Support Systems
### Author(s):
- Brian L. Dos Santos
- Martin L. Bariff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
The growing importance of DSS for both strategy evaluation and end user computing increases the need to provide research-based guidance for the design of user interface aids. This research study addresses the common belief that greater flexibility and choice in software aids will promote improved user performance. For model-based decision support systems, the effects of user vs. system-guided model manipulation, variable vs. exception-based report content, and display of incremental changes vs. actual outcomes on strategy formulation were investigated in a laboratory experiment with 46 undergraduate business students. The findings suggest that a system-guided or a more structured model manipulation strategy and the display of incremental changes significantly improve performance. Thus, for this task context, evidence is presented which runs counter to popular beliefs.

## 5. State-Level Efforts to Transfer Manufacturing Technology: A Survey of Programs and Practices
### Author(s):
- Andrew W. Wyckoff
- Louis G. Tornatzky
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This study analyzed state-level university-based efforts to increase manufacturing productivity through the transfer of technologies, such as robotics and microcomputers, to manufacturing establishments. A survey was conducted by phone interview of 15 state programs that were operating in 1985. Information was gathered on the goals, planning, budgets, marketing, staffing, organizational structure, technical focus, and evaluation practices of the programs.

## 6. Service Constrained (s, S) Inventory Systems with Priority Demand Classes and Lost Sales
### Author(s):
- Morris A. Cohen
- Paul R. Kleindorfer
- Hau L. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model of an (s, S) inventory system in which there are two priority classes of customers. The model treats excess demands as lost sales and can accommodate an arbitrary deterministic lead time. After considering the associated Markov-chain model, an approximate, renewal-based model is derived. This approximation is used to develop a greedy heuristic which minimizes expected costs subject to a fill-rate service constraint. The paper concludes with the results of an extensive numerical test of both the accuracy of the approximation and the performance of the heuristic with respect to the true optimal solution. Results indicate good performance which deteriorates as the fill rate requirement and lead time increase.

## 7. Optimal Order of Servers for Tandem Queues in Light Traffic
### Author(s):
- Betsy S. Greenberg
- Ronald W. Wolff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
We study single-server stations in tandem, in which customers arrive according to a Poisson Process and are to be served at each of two servers. The order of the stations is assumed not to affect the quality of the service customers obtain. Using a light traffic approximation, we select (for various joint distributions of service time) the order of the stations that minimizes expected customer delay.

## 8. The Relationship Between Shareholding Concentration and Shareholder Voting Power in British Companies: A Study of the Application of Power Indices for Simple Games
### Author(s):
- Dennis Leech
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This paper reports an analysis of the relationships between shareholding and voting power distributions in a sample of British companies. It applies two standard approaches to the measurement of power in simple games: the Shapley-Shubik and the Banzhaf power indices. The results indicate that power is more concentrated than ownership in every case. A comparison of the two indices reveals that typically the Banzhaf index gives a more concentrated power distribution. For the Shapley-Shubik index the power ratio for the largest shareholder is accurately described in terms of the size of holding and the concentration of the remainder. The corresponding Banzhaf power ratio is less dependent on these variables. There is no association between power concentration and company size.

## 9. Economic Contests with Incomplete Information and Optimal Contest Design
### Author(s):
- Nirvikar Singh
- Donald Wittman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes contests where contestants have private information about their abilities, and these abilities may be correlated. It differs from previous work chiefly in that it allows for such imperfect correlation, and that it restricts attention to a discrete output space. The latter aspect enables a complete characterization of possible equilibria. The analysis draws special attention to the possibility that equilibrium may involve lower ability contestants choosing higher effort and winning the contest. It is demonstrated that it may be optimal for the contest designer to induce such equilibria, and some conditions for this are derived. Different possible objectives of the contest designer are also discussed.

## 10. A Simple Method of Computing Prediction Intervals for Time Series Forecasts
### Author(s):
- Everette S. Gardner, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
Theoretical approaches to computing prediction intervals require strong assumptions that do not appear to hold in practice. This paper presents an empirical approach to prediction intervals that assumes very little. During model-fitting, variances of the errors are computed at different forecast leadtimes. Using these variances, the Chebyshev inequality is applied to determine prediction intervals. Empirical evidence is presented to show that this approach gives reasonable results. For example, using the 111 series in the M-competition, 95% prediction intervals actually contain 95.8% of post-sample observations.

## 11. NoteOptimal Work-Rest Scheduling with Exponential Work-Rate Decay
### Author(s):
- Stephen E. Bechtold
- DeWitt L. Sumners
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1988
### Abstract:
This note develops optimal multiple rest break models for the case when the decay in work rate is an exponential function of time worked and recovery of work rate potential during rest is a linear function of time rested. While empirical evidence indicates that work rate decay functions tend to be best approximated by either exponential or linear functions, previous multiple rest break models were based upon a linear work rate decay function. Efficient solution procedures are developed which require only the solution of a transcendental equation using Newton's or an equivalent method. Although linear-linear and exponential-linear models are demonstrated to share some important general characteristics, a preliminary analysis indicated that use of linear-linear policies resulted in substantial sacrifices in productive output when relatively high rates of exponential decay were present. The observed losses were exacerbated by higher rates of recovery.
