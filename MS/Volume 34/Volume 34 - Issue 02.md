## 1. Decision Support System Effectiveness: A Review and an Empirical Test
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Despite the increasing popularity of decision support systems (DSS), effectiveness of such systems remains unproven. Past research claiming usefulness of the DSS has relied largely on anecdotal or case data. The relatively few laboratory experiments report mixed results regarding the effects of a decision aid. This study reviews the results of prior investigations and examines the effectiveness of DSS-aided decision makers relative to decision makers without a DSS over an eight-week period. An executive decision making game was used in two sections of a business strategy course. Three-person teams in one section used a DSS while the teams in the other section played the game without such an aid.

## 2. Momentum Accounting and Managerial Goals on Impulses
### Author(s):
- Yuji Ijiri
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
Conventional accounting measures wealth W (assets and liabilities) and accounts for its net change, W(t + 1)  W(t), by means of income W(t), classified into various revenue and expense items. Proposed momentum accounting measures income momentum  = dW/dt (time rate at which income is being earned at a given point in time) and accounts for its net change, (t + 1)  (t), by means of impulses (t). Here the impulses, a term borrowed from the momentum-impulse principle in mechanics, are classified into various factors, internal or external to the enterprise, that contributed to the momentum change. If conventional accounting is viewed as focusing on an odometer of a car, momentum accounting is analogous to focusing on its speedometer and attributing the change in its reading to impulses that are judged to be responsible for the change. This paper proposes impulse-based managerial goals as a substitute for currently popular income-based managerial goals, discussing problems associated with the latter that highlights short-term income achievements and that tends to reward management for the momentum created by their predecessors as it is realized as income by the mere passage of time.

## 3. Modeling Multiattribute Utility, Risk, and Belief Dynamics for New Consumer Durable Brand Choice
### Author(s):
- John H. Roberts
- Glen L. Urban
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a brand choice model to aid in the prelaunch management of a new consumer durable entry in an existing category. The model contributes to theory by integrating the critical phenomena of multiattribute preference, risk, and dynamics in an individual level expected utility framework. The integration is based on established theoretical constructs in utility, Bayesian decision analysis, and discrete choice theory. Measurement and estimation procedures are presented, an application is described, and the managerial relevance of this work as a planning and forecasting tool is examined.

## 4. The Reliability of Subjective Probabilities Obtained Through Decomposition
### Author(s):
- H. V. Ravinder

- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
The use of decomposition as a procedure for improving the consistency of subjective probability encoding is discussed. Using a psychometric measurement model, an expression is developed that describes the random error associated with decomposition estimates as a function of characteristics of the component assessments. Decomposition is compared to direct assessment in terms of the percent change in measurement error that can be attributed to the use of decomposition. Potential benefits of decomposition are specified and recommendations made on how to utilize decomposition as an approach for error control.

## 5. Frames of Mind in Intertemporal Choice
### Author(s):
- George F. Loewenstein
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
Recent research has demonstrated that choices between gambles are systematically influenced by the way they are expressed. Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory (Kahneman, D., A. Tversky. 1979. Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica47(2) 363391.) explains many of these framing effects as shifts in the point of reference from which prospects are evaluated. This paper demonstrates the applicability of the reference point concept to intertemporal choice. Three experiments demonstrate that when people choose between immediate and delayed consumption, the reference point used to evaluate alternatives can significantly influence choice. The first study elicited relative preference for immediate and delayed consumption using three methods, each of which differently framed choices between alternatives offering identical end-state consumption. The conventional discounted utility model predicts that the three methods of elicitation should yield similar estimates of time preference, but preferences were found to differ in accordance with a reference point model. The second and third studies extend and replicate the results from the first, the third using real rather than hypothetical choices.

## 6. Optimizing Resource Acquisition Decisions by Stochastic Programming
### Author(s):
- Daniel Bienstock
- Jeremy F. Shapiro
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
This paper reports on the application of stochastic programming with recourse to strategic planning decisions regarding resource acquisition. A resource directed decomposition method, which simultaneously exploits stochastic programming and mixed integer programming model structures, is proposed. Computational experience with the method applied to fuel contract and plant construction decisions faced by an electric utility is presented.

## 7. Information Cost and Innovation Adoption Policies
### Author(s):
- Richard Jensen
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
A firm's manager must decide whether to adopt an innovation of uncertain profitability or to obtain some information and then decide to adopt or reject the innovation. Obtaining information can involve either waiting to receive some costless information or buying some additional information as well. The optimal policy for this decision problem may not have a reservation property. That is as the probability of success rises from 0 to 1, the optimal policy may be: wait, buy, wait, buy, and adopt. This suggests a complexity in managerial decision-making regarding innovations of uncertain profitability when there are both costless and costly information sources available to the manager.

## 8. Optimally Balancing Large Assembly Lines with Fable
### Author(s):
- Roger V. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
A new algorithm for optimally balancing assembly lines is formulated and tested. Named FABLE, it obtains proven optimal solutions for ten 1000 task lines, which each possess the computationally favorable conditions of an average of at least 6 tasks per work station and a small number of between-task precedence requirements, in less than 20 seconds of IBM 3033U CPU time for each problem. FABLE also performs very favorably on a benchmark group of 64 test problems drawn from the literature, which are of up to 111 tasks each. FABLE finds and proves an optimal solution to the 64 problems in a total of 3.16 seconds of IBM 3090 CPU time.

## 9. NoteA Branch-and-Bound Approach to the Bicriterion Scheduling Problem Involving Total Flowtime and Range of Lateness
### Author(s):

- Parthasarati Dileepan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1988
### Abstract:
This paper considers a bicriterion scheduling problem where a linear combination of two objective functions is considered, with weighting factors used to represent relative importance of the two criteria, i.e., total flowtime and range of lateness. A branch-and-bound solution procedure is designed for the problem. Computational results are also reported.
