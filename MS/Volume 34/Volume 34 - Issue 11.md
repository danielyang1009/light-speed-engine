### Abstract:
Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) is a method for computing a sample path derivative with respect to an input parameter in a discrete event simulation. The IPA algorithm is based on the fact that for certain parameters and any realization of a simulation, the change in parameter can be made small enough so that only the times of events get shifted, but their order does not change. This paper considers the convergence properties of the IPA sample path derivatives. In particular, the question of when an IPA estimate converges to the derivative of a steady state performance measure is studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for this convergence are derived for a class of regenerative processes. Although these conditions are not guaranteed to be satisfied in general, they are satisfied for the mean stationary response time in the M/G/1 queue. A necessary condition for multiple IPA estimates to simultaneously converge to the derivatives of steady state throughputs in a queueing network is determined. The implications of this necessary condition are that, except in special cases, the original IPA algorithm cannot be used to consistently estimate steady state throughput derivatives in queueing networks with multiple types of customers, state-dependent routing or blocking. Numerical studies on IPA convergence properties are also presented.

## 2. Resolving a Conflict Situation with a Reference Outcome: An Axiomatic Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
We formulate an axiomatic model of conflict situations in which there exist two prominent outcomes. One is the traditional conflict outcome, the other is the reference outcome. The latter is an outcome with the following properties: (1) It is Pareto-superior to the conflict outcome, (2) It is not Pareto optimal, (3) All the bargainers agree that the conflict's solution should be Pareto superior to it. We present a solution function for this model. It satisfies uniquely several desirable requirements. The model is an extension of Nash's Bargaining Problem paradigm, and the particular solution function we propose is a variation of the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution.

## 3. Competitive Dealing Strategy and Deal Value Escalation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
This note is an extension of A Mathematical Model for Price Promotions (Kinberg, Rao and Shakun [Kinberg, Yoram, Ambar G. Rao, Melvin F. Shakun. 1974. A mathematical model for price promotions. Management Sci.20 948959.]). That paper derived the revenue maximizing deal value for a firm in a monopolistically competitive, price (quality) partitioned market having two premium brands and consumers whose responses to deals are heterogeneous. This optimal deal value was derived under the assumed condition of no competitive dealing. When competitive dealing was considered, both dealing brands were assumed to offer the same optimal deal value. By extending the work of KRS to include a number of competitors sufficiently large that at least one is dealing in each period, this paper shows that a reactive dealing strategy based on a single optimal deal value produces negative profits and will not produce a stable equilibrium.

## 4. A Sequential Lot Sizing Heuristic with Optimal Average Performance
### Author(s):
- Sven Axster
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
The classical dynamic lot size problem without backlogging is in practice usually solved with the aid of various heuristics. Most heuristics are sequential techniques, i.e. the future demand is considered period for period, and a decision whether to have a set-up or not in a certain period is taken without regarding the future demand. The average performance of a lot sizing heuristic will depend on the demand process. We assume that a typical demand will look like a sequence of independent identically distributed random numbers, and we derive a sequential lot sizing rule with optimal average performance under such circumstances. The optimal decision rule is compared to the Silver-Meal heuristic. We also analyze the situation when the decision rule is allowed to look ahead one period.

## 5. A Light-Traffic Approximation for Single-Class Departure Processes from Multi-Class Queues
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
This paper discusses an approximation for single-class departure processes from multi-class queues: If the arrival rate of one class upon one visit to the queue is a small proportion of the total arrival rate there, then the departure process for that class from that visit should be nearly the same as the arrival process for that class for that visit. This can be regarded as a light-traffic approximation, but only the one class must be in light traffic; the overall traffic intensity of the queue need not be low. As a consequence, in a queueing network if the routing for one class is deterministic, and if the light-traffic condition applies at every queue this class visits, then the arrival and departure processes for this class at each visit to each queue should be nearly the same as its external arrival process. This approximation is explained in terms of different time scales, and is justified here by a limit theorem in a special case. There are important implications for parametric decomposition approximation techniques: the variability parameter partially characterizing the departure process at any visit to any queue of such a low-intensity class should be nearly the same as the variability parameter partially characterizing the arrival process for that class at that visit to that queue. The approximation principle in this form was recently proposed by G. Bitran and D. Tirupati while developing improved parametric-decomposition approximations for low-variability multi-class queueing networks with deterministic routing, which have important, applications in manufacturing. The approximation principle also has important implications for data networks showing how burstiness in originated traffic can pass through heavily shared network facilities where it has relatively little effect and then reappear at the destination.

## 6. Economic Design of Control Charts with Different Control Limits for Different Assignable Causes
### Author(s):
- George Tagaras
- Hau L. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
The use of multiple control limits and multiple corresponding levels of response for processes is an effective way for statistical process control when different assignable causes exist which lead to different out-of-control states of the processes, and different restoration procedures. This paper examines the optimal economic design of such process control charts. The exact mathematical model is developed and the expected cost per time unit function is derived. The costs associated with the statistical process control are minimized by means of an optimization procedure involving a quasi-Newton method and a Fibonacci lattice search. Sensitivity analysis performed on a large number of numerical examples reveals key relationships between model parameters. A comparison between the proposed control chart and an approximate matched single-cause chart shows that the former can be a significant improvement over the latter. Several model extensions and managerial implications are also discussed.

## 7. Modeling Time-Dependent Arrivals to Service Systems: A Case in Using a Piecewise-Polynomial Rate Function in a Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
We consider the use of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process in modeling time-dependent arrivals to service systems. In analyzing a set of actual arrival times corresponding to epochs of calls for on-line analysis of electrocardiograms, we found that approximating the rate function by an exponential polynomial (or exponential trigonometric polynomial) suggested in the literature inadequate. This was caused by the nature of our data which contained frequent cyclic abrupt changes in arrival rates. In this paper, we propose the use a piecewise polynomial to represent the rate function. We present two maximum likelihood estimators for estimating the parameters of the piecewise polynomialone based on arrival times, and another based on aggregated counts, and a numerical method for carrying out the computation. We use a procedure based on thinning for generating arrival times from such a process. For hypothesis testing, these are combined to produce critical values for the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic by a Monte Carlo simulation. While our approach is presented and discussed in the context of a specific case, the results are applicable and observations relevant to many other systems sharing similar patterns of variation.

## 8. Determining Safety Stock in the Presence of Stochastic Lead Time and Demand
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Eppen
- R. Kipp Martin
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of setting safety stock when both the demand in a period and the lead time are random variables. There are two cases to consider. In the first case the parameters of the demand and lead time distributions are known; in the second case they are unknown and must be estimated. For the case of known parameters a standard procedure is presented in the literature. In this paper, examples are used to show that this procedure can yield results that are far from the desired result. A correct procedure is presented.

## 9. NoteComments on A Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Vendor Profits
### Author(s):
- Prafulla N. Joglekar
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
Monahan (Monahan, J. P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits. Management Sci. (June) 720726.) adapted the quantity discount model of inventory theory to the problem of determining an optimal quantity discount schedule from a vendor's point of view, and opened up an important direction of research. However, his one-item, one-customer, one-vendor model is based on several implicit assumptions that must be judged unreasonable. Monahan must account for the vendor's inventory carrying charges and redefine his variable S2. It is shown that a rational vendor's manufacturing frequency would not be identical to the buyer's ordering frequency if the vendor's manufacturing setup costs are substantially larger than the buyer's ordering costs. A numerical example presented in this note also questions the practical usefulness of Monahan's model even after its theoretical inaccuracies axe corrected. Monahan's model may explain discounts that are a fraction of 1% of the price of an item, but it fails to explain commonly observed magnitudes of quantity discounts, such as 10% of the unit price.

## 10. ReplyOn Comments on a Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Vendor Profits
### Author(s):
- James P. Monahan
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1988
### Abstract:
Professor Joglekar is to be thanked for his generally insightful Comments (1988) concerning my paper (Monahan [Monahan, J. P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor points. Management Sci.30(6, June) 720726.). He has in my view correctly assessed the limitations of two important production assumptions I made, assumptions which need to be rethought in any quantity-discount pricing models of the future. Yet, although I find myself in general agreement with Joglekar's comments, I wish to clarify some points concerning the model and its potential applicability.

### Author(s):
- Robin M. Hogarth
- Spyros Makridakis
### Published:

### Abstract:
On p. 673, we stated that we had been refused permission to replicate our study using the Markstrat game (Hogarth & Makridakis [Hogarth, R. M., S. Makridakis. 1981. The value of decision making in a complex environment: an experimental approach. Management Sci.27(1) 93107.]) and questioned whether our results had dampened willingness to conduct this kind of research using Markstrat. These statements were based on a misunderstanding. We sincerely regret their negative implications.
