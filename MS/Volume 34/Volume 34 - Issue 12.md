## 1. Inducing Rules for Expert System Development: An Example Using Default and Bankruptcy Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
With rapidly growing interest in the development of knowledge-based computer consulting systems for various problem domains, the difficulties associated with knowledge acquisition have special importance. This paper reports on the results of experiments designed to assess the effectiveness of an inductive algorithm in discovering predictive knowledge structures in financial data. The quality of the results are evaluated by comparing them to results generated by discriminant analysis, individual judgments, and group judgments. A partial intersection of predictive attributes occurs. More importantly, for all cases tested, the inductively produced knowledge structures perform better than the competing models.

## 2. One-Switch Utility Functions and a Measure of Risk
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
Consider the relative attractiveness to a decision maker of two financial gambles as the wealth of that individual varies. It may seem reasonable that either one alternative should be preferred for all wealth levels or that there exists a unique critical wealth level at which the decision maker switches from preferring one alternative to the other. Decreasing risk aversion is not sufficient for this property to hold: we identify the small class of utility functions for which it does. We show how the property leads naturally to a measure of risk.

## 3. An Object-Oriented World-View for Intelligent, Discrete, Next-Event Simulation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
Concepts from software engineering and knowledge engineering are incorporated into discrete, next-event simulation. The existing, conventional world-view utilized within discrete simulation is reviewed. A construct is presented that makes existing discrete simulation world-views more robust for problems involving endogenous decision-making. The use of knowledge bases and inference engines as mechanisms for modeling such decision making is presented. The result is a simulation world view that is able to simulate systems involving intelligent decision-making entities (actors) whose decisions strongly impact the state of the system.

## 4. Approximating Expected Warranty Costs
### Author(s):
- Edward W. Frees
- Seong-Hyun Nam
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
In this paper, we survey a portion of the literature in the analysis of warranty costs. In order to compare the price of different warranty policies, we review a framework which leads to expressing the expected costs in terms of complex functions arising in renewal theory. These functions and several approximations are discussed. In particular, a straight line approximation performs well.

## 5. Dynamically Updating Relevance Judgements in Probabilistic Information Systems Via Users' Feedback
### Author(s):
- Peter J. Lenk
- Barry D. Floyd
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
A decision maker's performance relies on the availability of relevant information. In many environments, the relation between the decision maker's informational needs and the information base is complex and uncertain. A fundamental concept of information systems, such as decision support and document retrieval, is the probability that the retrieved information is useful to the decision maker's query. This paper presents a sequential, Bayesian, probabilistic indexing model that explicitly combines expert opinion with data about the system's performance. The expert opinion is encoded into probability statements. These statements are modified by the users' feedback about the relevance of the retrieved information to their queries. The predictive probability that a datum in the information base is applicable to the current query is a logistic function of the expert opinion and the feedback. This feedback enters the computation through a measure of association between the current query-datum pair with previous, relevant query-datum pairs. When this measure is based on the proportional matching of multiple attributes, the predictive probabilities have a recursive formula that makes the model computationally feasible for large information bases.

## 6. Selection and Design of Heuristic Procedures for Solving Roll Trim Problems
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Haessler
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the selection and design of heuristic procedures for solving one-dimensional roll trim problems. These are well-defined combinatorial problems which are too large to optimize. Five different roll trim problems from the paper and film industries are described along with the heuristic procedures that have been used successfully to improve the quality of the solutions generated. The paper concludes with some general guidelines for developing industrial-grade heuristic problem solving procedures.

## 7. Computing Block-Angular Karmarkar Projections with Applications to Stochastic Programming
### Author(s):
- John R. Birge
- Liqun Qi
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
We present a variant of Karmarkar's algorithm for block-angular structured linear programs, such as stochastic linear programs. By computing the projection efficiently, we give a worst-case bound on the order of the running time that can be an order of magnitude better than that of Karmarkar's standard algorithm. Further implications for approximations and very large-scale problems are given.

## 8. The Single Machine Problem with a Quadratic Cost Function of Completion Times
### Author(s):

- John J. Liu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
This paper examines a single machine sequencing problem with a quadratic cost function of completion times. A new type of precedence relation is constructed that determines the ordering between adjacent jobs. Each pair of jobs has a critical start time, after which the precedence relation changes direction. These relations are incorporated into a solution procedure that solved 191 out of 200 test problems with job sizes ranging from 15 to 100 without using enumeration methods. Although 9 problems were not solved directly by the procedure, even these were reduced to 10 much smaller problems (of the job sizes 3 and 4) which could easily be solved by inspection.

## 9. Towards a Heuristic Theory of Problem Structuring
### Author(s):
- Gerald F. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1988
### Abstract:
Management science is concerned with understanding and improving action-oriented managerial thought. While it has addressed this concern through decision making research, there is an alternative conceptualizationthe problem solving paradigmthat appears to offer a valuable complementary perspective. This paper develops the foundations of a theory of managerial problem solving. It analyzes the concept of problem structure and proposes a conceptualization satisfying relevant criteria. The concept is used in the development of an informal theory of problem structuring. Several structuring methodologies are assessed and an approach pertinent to real world, managerial problems is proposed.

### Abstract:
In this paper we introduce a piecewise parametric production model that may be used as a reference technology for efficiency gauging. We show that other piecewise reference technologies used in efficiency measuring are obtained as special cases of our model.
