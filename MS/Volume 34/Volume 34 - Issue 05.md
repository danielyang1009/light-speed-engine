## 1. An Experiment in Approval Voting
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The first major experimental comparison of approval voting with regular plurality voting occurred in the 1985 annual election of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). In approval voting a person votes for (approves of) as many candidates as desired, the winner being the candidate with the most votes. By permitting more votes than the number of positions to be filled, approval voting collects more information from the voter than does plurality voting. This can make a difference, for example, when three candidates compete for a single office. In such situations two candidates with wide but similar appeal sometimes split a majority constituency so that, under plurality voting, a minority candidate is elected. By contrast, approval voting is likely to identify the candidate who is most broadly acceptable to the electorate as a whole.

## 2. Lead User Analyses for the Development of New Industrial Products
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
Recently, a lead user concept has been proposed for new product development in fields subject to rapid change (von Hippel [von Hippel, E. 1986. Lead users: A source of novel product concepts. Management Sci.32 791805.]). In this paper we integrate market research within this lead user methodology and report a test of it in the rapidly evolving field of computer-aided systems for the design of printed circuit boards (PC-CAD). In the test, lead users were successfully identified and proved to have unique and useful data regarding both new product needs and solutions responsive to those needs. New product concepts generated on the basis of lead user data were found to be strongly preferred by a representative sample of PC-CAD users. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of this first empirical test of the lead user methodology, and suggest directions for future research.

## 4. Strategic Implications of Darwinian Economics for Selling Efficiency and Choice of Integrated or Independent Sales Forces
### Author(s):
- Erin Anderson
### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
Most managers, when confronted with a difficult strategic decision, would like to know what is the prevailing practice in their industry. Prevailing practice interests managers, in part, because it may indicate which decisions are good, even best. The rationale is Darwinian economics, which proposes that competitive markets operate to force at least an approximation of optimal behavior, because wrong decisions are extinguished by the market mechanism. If so, the bulk of survivors make good business decisions and their collective practice is worth knowing, meaning it should be difficult to improve upon. This paper tests whether prevailing practice represents good decisions. The context is the decision whether to fill a sales district with a company (integrated) sales force or with outside agents (independents). The outcome of the choice is the ratio of sales to the cost of running the sales force, i.e., selling efficiency. A model is described which summarizes industry decisions, and two propositions are developed. Proposition 1, a simple version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule as to when they should integrate. Proposition 2, a contingent version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule in unpredictable selling environments but that conforming to the rule has no impact in predictable environments. The rationale is that firms learn the environment well enough to know when to depart from the rule in predictable settings but not otherwise. The relationship between efficiency and conformity to prevailing practice is examined for 93 sales districts of 11 recognized electronic component manufacturers. The results support proposition 2: the most efficient sales forces conform to prevailing practice and the least efficient deviate, but only in uncertain environments. In more certain environments, conformity and efficiency are unrelated. Implications (such as when it pays to be different) and suggestions for future research are discussed.

## 5. Long Range Process Design and Compatibility Among Operations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
Most processes consist of several operations. Some or all of these operations may have more than one alternative technological method, resulting in an exponential relationship between the number of possible designs and the number of operation alternatives. However, some of these designs may not be feasible because of incompatibilities among operation alternatives. A feasible process design will include one alternative for each operation in such a way that each operation is compatible with every other operation in the design. For identifying these feasible designs, there are two approaches: traditional and morphological. The former relies on trial-and-error, expert judgment, and creative thinking and the latter considers, explicitly or implicitly, every possible design. This paper presents an efficient algorithm with computational results for identifying all feasible designs based on compatibility considerations. The implementation issues, both computational and organizational, are discussed as integral parts of a framework for process design efforts. This framework combines the advantages of both the traditional and morphological approaches and mitigates their disadvantages. It also facilitates interaction between the expert's judgment and the programmed model.

## 6. A New Algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem
### Author(s):
- Silvano Martello
- Paolo Toth
### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
We present a new algorithm for the optimal solution of the 0-1 Knapsack problem, which is particularly effective for large-size problems. The algorithm is based on determination of an appropriate small subset of items and the solution of the corresponding core problem: from this we derive a heuristic solution for the original problem which, with high probability, can be proved to be optimal. The algorithm incorporates a new method of computation of upper bounds and efficient implementations of reduction procedures. The corresponding Fortran code is available. We report computational experiments on small-size and large-size random problems, comparing the proposed code with all those available in the literature.

## 7. Utility Functions for Infinite-Period Planning
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
This paper presents a systematic discussion of decision analysis models for attitudes toward risk when the effects of a public policy choice extend into the distant or unbounded future. Several issues of social risk attitudes are identified and discussed. Conditions on preferences are presented by which value judgments concerning these issues can be included in a formal model for a public policy evaluation.

## 8. NoteOptimal Pricing Policy for the Service Facility Offering a Set of Priority Prices
### Author(s):
- Hanna Alperstein
### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
A profit making service facility that offers a set of different prices for the single service it provides is considered. By paying a higher price, the customer buys into a priority class that shortens his stay in the service system. We determine the optimal number of priority classes and the set of prices that affords the service facility a higher revenue than any other set. Relying on Adiri and Yechiali (Adiri, I., U. Yechiali. 1974. Optimal priority-purchasing and pricing decisions in non monopoly and monopoly queues. Oper. Res.22 10511066.) who demonstrated that the customers' optimal priority-purchasing strategy is of the control limit type, we prove that for every set of M(>1) priority prices that are optimal to the service facility, the control limits of all priority classes equal one except the control limit of the highest priority class that is determined by the parameters of the system. We show that the highest priority class also has a control limit of one when the service facility uses the optimal M and optimal priority prices. Thus full optimality results in implementation of the pure LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) service discipline.

## 9. ReplyConsider the Principal Finding: A Reply to William T. Ross
### Author(s):
- Robin M. Hogarth

### Published:
- 1 May 1988
### Abstract:
By focussing on issues concerning precise relative performance of the human and experimental teams, Ross obscures the major, and a priori surprising result of our study. This is that the experimental teams were not all dominated by the human teams. Replication is the appropriate way to illuminate the substantive issues raised by our study rather than arguments based on ex-post and possibly questionable statistical analyses.
