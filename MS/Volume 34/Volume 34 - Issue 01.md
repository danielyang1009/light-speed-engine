## 1. A Goal Programming/Constrained Regression Review of the Bell System Breakup

### Published:

### Abstract:
The recently implemented court decision to break up Bell (=American Telephone & Telegraph Co.) to accord with U.S. anti-trust laws represents a highly significant policy decision which is proving to be influential in other countries as well as the U.S. The telecommunication industry is of such size and importance that even relatively small economies that might be lost with Bell's breakup as a natural monopoly could involve substantial welfare losses to consumers and producers. Studies commissioned by the U.S. Justice Department that approached this topic by econometric methods reported that the evidence failed to support the contention that Bell was a natural monopoly. Here a goal programming/constrained regression, as developed in the Management Science literature, uses the same functional form and the same data but nevertheless reverses the main findings of the econometric studies in every one of the 20 years covered. This kind of difference in results obtained by two different methods of analysis points up a need for drawing on persons from different disciplines who are capable of checking each other's methodologies when important policy decisions may be influenced by results that depend on the methodologies that these disciplines customarily use. Advantages of doing this are further illustrated by data deficiencies that escape detection by the econometric methods employed in the Justice Department-commissioned studies.

## 2. RejoinderNatural Monopoly and the Bell System: Response to Charnes, Cooper and Sueyoshi
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
Our study of the Bell System cost function shows that it is possible to reject the hypothesis that AT&T was a natural monopoly. Our study is based on a regression analysis of a translog cost function estimated on 19471977 data. Charnes, Cooper, and Sueyoshi (Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper, T. Sueyoshi. 1988. A goal programming/constrained regression review of the bell system breakup. Management Sci.34 126.) claim that they reverse our conclusion when they use goal programming estimators of a translog cost function estimated on exactly the same data that we use. This claim is false. There is no basis for comparing our estimates with their estimates because they, in fact, use different data than we use and estimate a different cost function than we estimate. Moreover, when goal programming estimates and regression estimates based on the same data and similar cost function specifications are compared, they yield similar estimates and produce the same inference about natural monopoly.

## 3. Perturbation Analysis Gives Strongly Consistent Sensitivity Estimates for the M/G/1 Queue
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
The technique of perturbation analysis has recently been introduced as an efficient way to compute parameter sensitivities for discrete event systems. Thus far, the statistical properties of perturbation analysis have been validated mainly through experiments. This paper considers, for an M/G/1 queueing system, the sensitivity of mean system time of a customer to a parameter of the arrival or service distribution. It shows analytically that (i) the steady state value of the perturbation analysis estimate of this sensitivity is unbiased, and (ii) a perturbation analysis algorithm implemented on a single sample path of the system gives asymptotically unbiased and strongly consistent estimates of this sensitivity. (No previous knowledge of perturbation analysis is assumed, so the paper also serves to introduce this technique to the unfamiliar reader.) Numerical extensions to GI/G/1 queues, and applications to optimization problems, are also illustrated.

## 4. Analyzing Simulation Experiments with Common Random Numbers
### Author(s):
- Jack P. C. Kleijnen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
To analyze simulation runs which use the same random numbers, the blocking concept of experimental design is not needed. Instead, this paper applies a linear regression model with a nondiagonal covariance matrix. This covariance matrix does not need to have a specific pattern such as constant covariances. A simple example yields surprising results. The paper proposes a new framework for the error analysis. This framework consists of three factors (namely, common random numbers, replication, model validity), each with three levels.

## 5. Multiproduct Queueing Networks with Deterministic Routing: Decomposition Approach and the Notion of Interference
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Devanath Tirupati
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
Queueing networks have been used to model the performance of a variety of complex systems. Since exact results exist for only a limited class of networks, the decomposition methodology has been used extensively to obtain approximate results. In this paper, we consider open queueing networks with multiple product classes, deterministic routings and general arrival and service distributions. We examine the decomposition method for such systems and show that it provides estimates of key parameters with an accuracy that is not acceptable in many practical settings. Recognizing this weakness, we enrich the approach by modeling a phenomenon previously ignored. We consider interference among products and describe its effect on the variance of the departure streams. The recognition of this effect significantly improves the performance of this methodology. We provide extensive experimental results based on the data of a manufacturer of semiconductor devices.

## 6. Evaluating Project Scheduling and Due Date Assignment Procedures: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):

- Vincent A. Mabert
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
Managers of construction projects, maintenance activities, auditing contracts, software shops, etc. are frequently faced with the task of establishing a new project's due date, which must compete with other projects already in progress or expected (forecasted) to start in the future. The study reported here addresses the problem of establishing due dates for projects which require limited resources, in an environment where new projects arrive continuously and randomly over time. A set of procedures is developed which set each project's due date when it arrives using information about the new project, current projects, and available resources. The due date setting procedures are tested via simulation with four activity scheduling heuristics that control the assignment of resources to specific activities of available projects. A second test demonstrates the performance of the due date procedures, where a portion of arriving projects have their due dates established by external forces beyond management's control. Performance measures of project mean completion time, project mean lateness, project standard deviation of lateness, and total tardiness (sum of all projects' tardy time) were collected for evaluation.

## 7. Optimal Advertising Policies for Diffusion Models of New Product Innovation in Monopolistic Situations
### Author(s):
- Engelbert Dockner
- Steffen Jrgensen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the determination of optimal advertising strategies for new product diffusion models. We consider the introduction of a new consumer durable in a monopolistic market and the evolution of sales is modelled by a flexible diffusion model. Repeat sales and possible entry of rivals are disregarded but we allow for discounting of future revenue streams and cost learning curve. Using standard methods of optimal control theory we characterize qualitatively the structure of an optimal advertising strategy for different versions of the diffusion model.

## 8. NotePrice Indexes to Calculate Real R&D Expenditures
### Author(s):
- Klaus Brockhoff
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1988
### Abstract:
In a recent contribution, Mansfield (Mansfield, Edwin. 1987. Price indexes for R and D inputs, 19691983. Management Sci.33(January) 124129.) published a R&D deflator for American industrial R&D expenditures. A similar deflator is presented here for German industrial R&D expenditures. It is shown that both indexes are closely related to R&D employment. They can also be used to evaluate the relative costs of spending on R&D between countries.
