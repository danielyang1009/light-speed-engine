### Abstract:
We explore opportunities for targeted pricing for a retailer that only tracks weekly store-level aggregate sales and marketing-mix information. We show that it is possible, using these data, to recover essential features of the underlying distribution of consumer willingness to pay. Knowledge of this distribution may enable the retailer to generate additional profits from targeting by using choice information at the checkout counter. In estimating demand we incorporate a supply-side model of the distribution channel that captures important features of competitive price-setting behavior of firms. This latter aspect helps us control for the potential endogeneity generated by unmeasured product characteristics in aggregate data. The channel controls for competitive aspects both between manufacturers and between manufacturers and a retailer. Despite this competition, we find that targeted pricing need not generate the prisoner's dilemma in our data. This contrasts with the findings of theoretical models due to the flexibility of the empirical model of demand. The demand system we estimate captures richer forms of product differentiation, both vertical and horizontal, as well as a more flexible distribution of consumer heterogeneity.

## 2. Price and Delivery Logistics Competition in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We consider a supply chain in which two suppliers compete for supply to a customer. Pricing and delivery-frequency decisions in the system are analyzed by two three-stage noncooperative games with different decision rights designated to the parties involved. The customer first sets the price (or delivery frequency) for each supplier. Then, the suppliers offer the delivery frequencies (or prices) simultaneously and independently. Finally, the customer determines how much demand to allocate to each of the suppliers. We show that delivery frequency, similar to delivery speed in time-based competition, can be a source of competitive advantage. It also allows firms that sell identical products to offer complementary services to the customer because she can lower her inventory with deliveries from more suppliers. In general, higher delivery frequencies lower the value of getting deliveries from the second supplier and therefore intensify price competition. Assuming the cost structures do not change and the suppliers are identical, we show that when the customer controls deliveries, she would strategically increase delivery frequencies to lower prices. The distortion in delivery frequencies is larger and the overall performance of the supply chain is lower when the customer, not the suppliers, controls deliveries. Moreover, the customer is better off under delivery competition, while the suppliers are better off under price competition.

## 3. Supply Chain Management with Guaranteed Delivery
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We consider a two-stage supply chain under centralized control. The downstream facility faces discrete stochastic demand and passes supply requests to the upstream facility. The upstream facility always meets the supply requests from downstream. If the upstream facility cannot meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is optimal. Numerical analysis provides insight into the optimal policies and allows us to compare the supply chains under centralized and decentralized control.

## 4. A New Decision Rule for Lateral Transshipments in Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Sven Axsäter
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
This paper deals with a single–echelon inventory system consisting of a number of parallel local warehouses facing compound Poisson demand. There are standard holding and backorder costs as well as ordering costs at all warehouses. Normally, the warehouses replenish from an outside supplier. However, lateral transshipments between the warehouses are also possible. Such transshipments take no time but incur additional costs. When a demand occurs at a warehouse, the question is whether the whole demand or part of it should be covered by a lateral transshipment from another warehouse. Given a set of alternative decisions, our decision rule minimizes the expected costs under the assumption that no further transshipments will take place. This rule is then used repeatedly as a heuristic. A simulation study illustrates how the suggested technique performs under different conditions.

## 5. Into the Black Box: The Knowledge Transformation Cycle
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
This paper examines how knowledge is integrated in complex technology and product development settings. By framing the task of knowledge integration as a cycle, we highlight the inability of current knowledge transfer theories to explain the consequences that arise from the path-dependent nature of knowledge. We compare the complexity of this knowledge integration task to previous efforts in terms of its novelty and the organizational properties of specialization and dependence that are required. Drawing on evidence from two empirical studies, we outline three stages of the “knowledge transformation cycle,” which addresses the complexity of this integration task. We conclude with the implications of this knowledge transformation cycle on our understanding of knowledge management and organizational learning.

## 6. The Boycott Puzzle: Consumer Motivations for Purchase Sacrifice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
A boycott is never far from a firm's exchanges with its customers. Researchers in marketing need to understand consumer protest behavior, both to aid nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who wish to organize boycotts, and to assist managers who wish to develop appropriate strategic responses. Boycotts, like many other instances of collective action, are subject to free-rider and small-agent problems: there appears to be little or no motivation for an individual to participate. Yet they assuredly occur. We take an economic and psychological approach to the study of boycotts. Our approach is to develop a typology of motivations for consumer boycotts, to embed these motivations explicitly in a dynamic economic model, and thus to offer explanations for the extent of boycott participation.

## 7. Robust Pricing of the American Put Option: A Note on Richardson Extrapolation and the Early Exercise Premium
### Author(s):
- Alfredo Ibáñez
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
This paper presents a detailed analysis of the numerical implementation of the American put option decomposition into an equivalent European option plus an early exercise premium (Kim 1990, Jacka 1991, Carr et al. 1992). It subsequently introduces a new algorithm based upon this decomposition and Richardson extrapolation. This new algorithm is based upon (a) the derivation of the correct order for the error term when applying Richardson extrapolation, which is used to control the error of the extrapolated prices, (b) an innovative adjustment of Kim's (1990) discrete-time early exercise premium, so that these premiums monotonically converge and, therefore, it is appropriate to use them in extrapolation, and (c) the optimal exercise frontier can be quickly computed through Newton's method, permitting the efficient implementation of the decomposition formula in practice. Numerical experiments show that this new algorithm is accurate, efficient, easy to implement, and competitive in comparison with other methods. Finally, it can also be applied to other American exotic securities.

## 8. Virtual Progress: The Effect of Path Characteristics on Perceptions of Progress and Choice
### Author(s):

- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
In goal–oriented services, consumers want to get transported from one well–defined state (start) to another (destination) state without much concern for intermediate states. A cost–based evaluation of such services should depend on the total cost associated with the service—i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further, we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress), consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average progress.

## 9. The Shape of Utility Functions and Organizational Behavior
### Author(s):
- Joost M. E. Pennings
- Ale Smidts
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
Based on measurements among 332 owner-managers, we investigate how the global shape of the utility function (i.e., S-shaped versus concave or convex over the total range of outcomes) relates to choice behavior. We find that the global shape of the utility function differs across decision makers (about one-third of the owner-managers exhibit an S-shaped utility function) and that the global shape is linked to organizational behavior (i.e., the production system employed), a result that does not change when using different methods to identify the decision maker's global shape of the utility function. The decision maker's risk attitude (risk averse or risk seeking) does not affect the choice of the production system. Whereas the degree of risk aversion, based on the local shape of the utility function, may be important in explaining owner-managers' trading behavior (Pennings and Smidts 2000), more structural organizational behavior appears to be linked to the global shape of the utility function.

## 10. Remark on “Appropriateness and Impact of Platform-Based Product Development”
### Author(s):
- James D. Dana
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
When platform-based manufacturing exhibits overdesign costs then platform adoption will lead to a decrease in product line differentiation. In contrast, Krishnan and Gupta (2001) argued that in the presence of overdesign costs and platform economies, platform production always leads to a more differentiated product family. While Krishnan and Gupta analyzed one particular parameterized cost function and define overdesign costs and platform economies narrowly in terms of their parameters, I propose a general definition of overdesign costs and show that platform adoption reduces product differentiation for all cost functions satisfying this definition, regardless of whether or not they exhibit platform economies.

### Author(s):
- Keely L. Croxton
- Bernard Gendron
- Thomas L. Magnanti
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2003
### Abstract:
We study a generic minimization problem with separable nonconvex piecewise linear costs, showing that the linear programming (LP) relaxation of three textbook mixed-integer programming formulations each approximates the cost function by its lower convex envelope. We also show a relationship between this result and classical Lagrangian duality theory.
