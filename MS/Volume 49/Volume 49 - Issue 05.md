### Abstract:
Complexity of communication is one of the important factors that distinguishes multilateral negotiation from its bilateral cousin. We investigate how the communication configuration affects a three-person coalition negotiation. Restricting who can communicate with whom strongly influences outcomes, and not always in ways that current theory anticipates. Competitive frictions, including a tendency to communicate offers privately, appear to shape much of what we observe. Our results suggest that parties with weaker alternatives would benefit from a more constrained structure, especially if they can be the conduit of communication, while those endowed with stronger alternatives would do well to work within a more public communication structure that promotes competitive bidding.

## 2. The Utilization of Competing Technologies Within the Firm: Evidence from Cardiac Procedures
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper examines the role of technological status in determining the rates at which competing techniques are used within a firm. Consistent with prior studies, technological status is measured on the basis of an actor's prior contributions to the body of knowledge concerning a given technique. The empirical analysis considers two treatments for coronary artery disease (CAD), each of which is associated with a distinct professional group within a hospital. These two groups are often characterized as engaging in a “turf war” for patients. After controlling for several factors that might explain technological choice—the clinical severity of patients, the relative quality of the two procedures at a given facility, firm-level financial performance, and other firm-level characteristics—I find that the technological status of the group associated with each technique affects the relative rate at which it is used within a given hospital. Moreover, this effect is strongest for patients at the margin between the two techniques. These results suggest that viewing the choice between competing innovations as a single, firm-level decision may not always capture the true dynamics underlying such a situation.

## 3. Newsvendor Bounds and Heuristic for Optimal Policies in Serial Supply Chains

### Abstract:
We consider the classic N-stage serial supply systems with linear costs and stationary random demands. There are deterministic transportation leadtimes between stages, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. The optimal inventory policy for this system is known to be an echelon base-stock policy, which can be computed through minimizing N nested convex functions recursively. To identify the key determinants of the optimal policy, we develop a simple and surprisingly good heuristic. This method minimizes 2Nseparate newsvendor-type cost functions, each of which uses the original problem data only. These functions are lower and upper bounds for the echelon cost functions; their minimizers form bounds for the optimal echelon base-stock levels. The heuristic is the simple average of the solution bounds. In extensive numerical experiments, the average relative error of the heuristic is 0.24%, with the maximum error less than 1.5%. The bounds and the heuristic, which can be easily obtained by simple spreadsheet calculations, enhance the accessibility and implementability of the multiechelon inventory theory. More importantly, the closed-form expressions provide an analytical tool for us to gain insights into issues such as system bottlenecks, effects of system parameters, and coordination mechanisms in decentralized systems.

## 4. Predicting the Equity Premium with Dividend Ratios
### Author(s):
- Amit Goyal

### Published:
- 1 May 2003
### Abstract:
Our paper suggests a simple, recursive residuals (out-of-sample) graphical approach to evaluating the predictive power of popular equity premium and stock market time-series forecasting regressions. When applied, we find that dividend ratios should have been known to have no predictive ability even prior to the 1990s, and that any seeming ability even then was driven by only two years, 1973 and 1974. Our paper also documents changes in the time-series processes of the dividends themselves and shows that an increasing persistence of dividend-price ratio is largely responsible for the inability of dividend ratios to predict equity premia. Cochrane's (1997) accounting identity—that dividend ratios have to predict long-run dividend growth or stock returns—empirically holds only over horizons longer than 5–10 years. Over shorter horizons, dividend yields primarily forecast themselves.

## 5. Salesforce Compensation Scheme and Consumer Inferences
### Author(s):

- 1 May 2003
### Abstract:
We investigate the salesforce compensation strategy of a firm selling products in a category that several consumers find technically sophisticated, such as electronics or financial products with legal fine print. Consumers are unable to judge the value difference between a baseline product and a product upgrade with add-on features. While the firm and the salespeople are informed of the value of these features, consumers are uncertain. Thus, consumers have to rely on sales assistance to evaluate alternatives. The salesperson decision variables include selling effort and whether to “oversell” the consumer by overclaiming the value of added features. Because sales revenue depends on both the salesperson's selling effort and consumers' valuation of the added features, the salesforce incentive scheme (which can consist of salary, sales commission, or consumer satisfaction-based commission) may induce the short-term oriented salesperson to misrepresent the value of the upgrade. Exaggeration of the value of the added features, however, results in reduced satisfaction levels leading to lower profits for the firm. We show that a salesperson selling products where the value of the upgrade is low prefers to make higher claims when the sales commission rate is sufficiently high. We conjecture that consumers aware of the incentive structure facing the salesperson expect the true value of the add-on feature to be lower than the claimed value. We study the optimal compensation scheme of a firm, which has to communicate her true type and retain its salesforce credibility. We identify the conditions under which a high-upgrade-type firm indicates its true value by altering sales commission rate and satisfaction-based commission rate.

## 6. The Importance of Ordering in Sequential Auctions
### Author(s):
- Wedad Elmaghraby
### Published:
- 1 May 2003
### Abstract:
To date, the largest part of literature on multi-unit auctions has assumed that there are k homogeneous objects being auctioned, where each bidder wishes to win exactly one or all of k units. These modeling assumptions have made the examination of ordering in sequential auctions inconsequential. The aim of this paper is to introduce and highlight the critical influence that ordering can have on the efficiency of an auction. We study a buyer who outsources via sequential 2nd-price auctions two heterogeneous jobs, and faces a diverse set of suppliers with capacity constraints.
