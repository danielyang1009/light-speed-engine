### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze demand postponement as a strategy to handle potential demand surges. Under demand postponement, a fraction of the demands from the “regular” period are postponed and satisfied during a “postponement” period. This permits capacity to be procured to satisfy the postponed demands. A reimbursement per unit is paid to customers whose demands are postponed. The basic idea is that by preempting stockouts through demand postponement, we can reduce overall stockout costs. We formulate and solve a two-stage capacity planning problem under demand postponement. We propose a power range class of distributions to capture the nature of demand surges. We establish the scalability and conjugate properties of the power range distributions under demand postponement, which leads to a tractable analysis of the problem. We analytically solve the problem of determining the optimal regular and postponement period capacities, and the demand splitting rule to minimize the supplier's expected cost. We show that (a) the value of postponement may be significant depending on cost and demand parameters, (b) a postponement strategy may lead to reduced investment in initial capacity, and (c) it may be optimal to do no demand postponement over a range of demands even after observing a higher demand signal. We then relax several model assumptions and provide results for these extensions. We conclude with managerial insights.

## 2. You are Known by the Directors You Keep: Reputable Directors as a Signaling Mechanism for Young Firms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop an analytical model of outside directors' signaling role—a role that is especially important for entrepreneurial firms. We formally demonstrate that in the face of a market failure in which stakeholders refuse to align themselves with new firms, high-quality new ventures may be able to credibly signal their type by appointing reputable directors to their boards. However, this option is not universally feasible. Both directors' reputations and the quality of their information determine the effectiveness of this strategy. In contrast to earlier adverse selection models, we demonstrate that when the middlemen (directors) have incomplete information on firm quality, bad and good firms can coexist in equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the quality of the directors' information determines the mix of good and bad firms in the population of surviving firms. Avenues for future research and normative implications for practitioners are discussed.

## 3. Pricing and Capacity Sizing for Systems with Shared Resources: Approximate Solutions and Scaling Relations
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper considers pricing and capacity sizing decisions, in a single-class Markovian model motivated by communication and information services. The service provider is assumed to operate a finite set of processing resources that can besharedamong users; however, this shared mode of operation results in a service-rate degradation. Users, in turn, are sensitive to the delay implied by the potential degradation in service rate, and to the usage fee charged for accessing the system. We study the equilibrium behavior of such systems in the specific context of pricing and capacity sizing under revenue and social optimization objectives. Exact solutions to these problems can only be obtained via exhaustive simulations. In contrast, we pursue approximate solutions that exploit large-capacity asymptotics. Economic considerations and natural scaling relations demonstrate that the optimal operational mode for the system is close to “heavy traffic.” This, in turn, supports the derivation of simple approximate solutions to economic optimization problems, via asymptotic methods that completely alleviate the need for simulation. These approximations seem to be extremely accurate. The main insights that are gleaned in the analysis follow: congestion costs are “small,” the optimal price admits a two-part decomposition, and the joint capacity sizing and pricing problem decouples and admits simple analytical solutions that are asymptotically optimal. All of the above phenomena are intimately related to statistical economies of scale that are an intrinsic part of these systems.

## 4. The Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem with Linked Lot Sizes
### Author(s):
- Christopher Suerie
- Hartmut Stadtler
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
In this paper a new mixed integer programming (MIP) model formulation and its incorporation into a time-oriented decomposition heuristic for the capacitated lot-sizing problem with linked lot sizes (CLSPL) is proposed. The solution approach is based on an extended model formulation and valid inequalities to yield a tight formulation. Extensive computational tests prove the capability of this approach and show a superior solution quality with respect to other solution algorithms published so far.

## 5. Product Customization and Price Competition on the Internet
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
The Internet provides an unprecedented capability for sellers to learn about their customers and offer custom products at special prices. In addition, customization is more feasible today because of advances in manufacturing technologies that have improved sellers' manufacturing flexibility. We first develop a model of product customization and flexible pricing to incorporate the salient roles of the Internet and flexible manufacturing technologies in reducing the costs of designing and producing tailored consumer goods. We show how a monopoly seller may earn the highest profits by producing both standard and custom products and can raise prices for both types of products as customization and information collection technologies improve.

## 6. Application of the Fast Gauss Transform to Option Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
In many of the numerical methods for pricing American options based on the dynamic programming approach, the most computationally intensive part can be formulated as the summation of Gaussians. Though this operation usually requiresO(NN') work when there areN' summations to compute and the number of terms appearing in each summation isN, we can reduce the amount of work toO(N+N') by using a technique called the fast Gauss transform. In this paper, we apply this technique to the multinomial method and the stochastic mesh method, and show by numerical experiments how it can speed up these methods dramatically, both for the Black-Scholes model and Merton's lognormal jump-diffusion model. We also propose extensions of the fast Gauss transform method to models with non-Gaussian densities.

## 7. A Generalization of Pratt-Arrow Measure to Nonexpected-Utility Preferences and Inseparable Probability and Utility
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Nau
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
The Pratt-Arrow measure of local risk aversion is generalized for the n-dimensional state-preference model of choice under uncertainty in which the decision maker may have inseparable subjective probabilities and utilities, unobservable stochastic prior wealth, and/or smooth nonexpected-utility preferences. Local risk aversion is measured by the matrix of derivatives of the decision maker's risk-neutral probabilities, without reference to true subjective probabilities or riskless wealth positions, and comparative risk aversion is measured without requiring agreement on true probabilities. Risk-neutral probabilities and their derivatives are shown to be sufficient statistics for approximately optimal investment and financing decisions in complete markets for contingent claims.

## 8. Group Decisions with Multiple Criteria
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2003
### Abstract:
We consider a decision problem where a group of individuals evaluates multiattribute alternatives. We explore the minimal required agreements that are sufficient to specify the group utility function. A surprising result is that, under some conditions, a bilateral agreement among pairs of individuals on a single attribute is sufficient to derive the multiattribute group utility. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of an attribute, on an attribute evaluation function, or on willingness to pay. We focus on the case in which each individual's utility function is additive. We show that the group utility can be represented as the weighted sum of group attribute weights and, more remarkably, of attribute evaluation functions. These group attribute evaluation functions are in turn weighted sums of individual attribute evaluation functions.
