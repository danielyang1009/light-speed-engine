### Abstract:
This paper examines services in which customers encounter a gatekeeper who makes an initial diagnosis of the customer's problem and then may refer the customer to a specialist. The gatekeeper may also attempt to solve the problem, but the probability of treatment success decreases as the problem's complexity increases. Given the costs of treatment by the gatekeeper and the specialist, we find the firm's optimal referral rate from a particular gatekeeper to the specialists. We then consider the principal–agent problem that arises when the gatekeeper, but not the firm, observes the gatekeeper's treatment ability as well as the complexity of each customer's problem. We examine the relative benefits of compensation systems designed to overcome the effects of this information asymmetry and show that bonuses based solely on referral rates do not always ensure first–best system performance and that an appropriate bonus based on customer volume may be necessary as well. We also consider the value of such output–based contracts when gatekeepers are heterogeneous in ability, so that two gatekeeper types face different probabilities of treatment success when given the same problem. We show that the firm may achieve first–best performance by either offering two contracts that separate the gatekeeper types or by offering a single contract that coordinates the treatment decisions of both gatekeepers.

## 2. Conceptualizing and Measuring Variety in the Execution of Organizational Work Processes
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Variability in organizational work processes is believed to influence productivity, quality, flexibility, and a host of other aspects of organizational design and management, but this construct has never been clearly conceptualized and measured. This paper introduces the concept of sequential variety, which accounts for variability in the sequence of events or actions that make up a process. This paper also proposes and compares three measures of sequential variety in organizational processes: Average distance (based on optimal string matching), algorithmic complexity, and deviation from uniform, random Markov. These measures are compared and validated using a simulated data set that embodies the range of variation likely to be encountered in empirical studies. All three measures correlate well and provide useful indicators of sequential variety, but the measures based on optimal string matching and deviation from the uniform, random Markov seem likely to be more useful in various potential applications.

## 3. Customer Satisfaction in Virtual Environments: A Study of Online Investing
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Many firms are moving to make virtual interfaces their primary, or even sole, points of customer contact. In this environment, some traditional service quality dimensions that determine customer satisfaction, such as the physical appearance of facilities, employees, and equipment, and employees' responsiveness and empathy are unobservable. In contrast, trust may play a central role here in enhancing customer satisfaction. We model trust as an endogenously formed entity that ultimately impacts customer satisfaction, and we elucidate the linkages between trust and other factors related to the performance of the online service provider and to the service environment. The model is validated using two samples—one comprising 225 online investors of a large online broker, and the other comprising 203 members of the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). The findings suggest that perceived trustworthiness of an online broker is a significant antecedent to investors' satisfaction, and that perceived environmental security and perceived operational competence impact the formation of trust. The results have important managerial implications.

## 4. The Logistics Impact of a Mixture of Order-Streams in a Manufacturer-Retailer System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
We model a supply chain with two retail warehouses that place replenishment orders with a common manufacturing capacity. The two retailers differ in the variability of their order-streams. The order-stream from one retail warehouse is modeled as a Poisson process and from the other as a hyperexponential renewal process. Each retail warehouse uses a base-stock policy to place replenishment orders with the manufacturer. The manufacturer is modeled as a first-come-first-serve, single exponential server queue. We analyze the supply-side impact of this mixture of order-streams received by the manufacturer on both retailers. An exact analysis of this base-model generates closed-form expressions for distributions of the lead-time, outstanding orders, and expected inventory costs for each retailer, and leads to comparative results about the two retailers- performance measures. The base-model is extended to accommodate finished goods at the manufacturer, more than two retailers, and bulk-arrivals. We use the model to suggest managerial insights about the impact of the presence of a high-variability retailer on other retailers who share capacity, the distorting impact of manufacturer finished goods inventory on retailer incentives, and the incentives for retailers to participate in variability-reduction programs in the grocery industry.

## 5. Process Flexibility in Supply Chains
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
Process flexibility, whereby a production facility can produce multiple products, is a critical design consideration in multiproduct supply chains facing uncertain demand. The challenge is to determine a cost-effective flexibility configuration that is able to meet the demand with high likelihood. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the benefits from flexibility in multistage supply chains. We find two phenomena, stage-spanning bottlenecks and floating bottlenecks, neither of which are present in single-stage supply chains, which reduce the effectiveness of a flexibility configuration. We develop a flexibility measure g and show that increasing this measure results in greater protection from these supply-chain inefficiencies. We also identify flexibility guidelines that perform very well for multistage supply chains. These guidelines employ and adapt the single-stage chaining strategy of Jordan and Graves (1995) to multistage supply chains.

## 6. Inferring Infection Transmission Parameters That Influence Water Treatment Decisions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
One charge of the United States Environmental Protection Agency is to study the risk of infection for microbial agents that can be disseminated through drinking water systems, and to recommend water treatment policy to counter that risk. Recently proposed dynamical system models quantify indirect risks due to secondary transmission, in addition to primary infection risk from the water supply considered by standard assessments. Unfortunately, key parameters that influence water treatment policy are unknown, in part because of lack of data and effective inference methods. This paper develops inference methods for those parameters by using stochastic process models to better incorporate infection dynamics into the inference process. Our use of endemic data provides an alternative to waiting for, identifying, and measuring an outbreak. Data both from simulations and from New York City illustrate the approach.

## 7. Subjective Rationality, Self–Confirming Equilibrium, and Corporate Strategy
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Ryall
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
This paper presents a formal theory of subjective rationality and demonstrates its application to corporate strategy. An agent is said to be subjectively rational when decisions are consistent with the available facts and, where these are lacking, with the agent's own subjective assessments. A self–confirming equilibrium arises when agents' subjectively rational actions generate events that are consistent with their own expectations. Equilibrium strategies may be suboptimal because certain counterfactual beliefs may be erroneous and yet fail to be contradicted by events observed in equilibrium. This weakening of the stronger rationality assumptions inherent in many of the more familiar equilibrium ideas appears well suited to applications in strategy. In particular, performance advantage may be sustained by a firm when its subjectively rational competitors persistently employ suboptimal self–confirming strategies.

## 8. Solving the Convex Cost Integer Dual Network Flow Problem

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
In this paper1, we consider an integer convex optimization problem where the objective function is the sum of separable convex functions (that is, of the form ∑(i,j)ϵQF̄ij(wij) + ∑iϵPB̄i(μi)), the constraints are similar to those arising in the dual of a minimum cost flow problem (that is, of the form μi− μj≤ wij, (i,j)∈Q), with lower and upper bounds on variables. Letn= |P|,m= |Q| , andUbe the largest magnitude in the lower and upper bounds of variables. We call this problemthe convex cost integer dual network flow problem. In this paper, we describe several applications of the convex cost integer dual network flow problem arising in a dial-a-ride transit problem, inverse spanning tree problem, project management, and regression analysis. We develop network flow-based algorithms to solve the convex cost integer dual network flow problem. We show that using the Lagrangian relaxation technique, the convex cost integer dual network flow problem can be transformed into a convex cost primal network flow problem where each cost function is a piecewise linear convex function with integer slopes. Its special structure allows the convex cost primal network flow problem to be solved inO(nmlog(n2/m)log(nU)time. This time bound is the same time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem using the cost-scaling algorithm, and is also is best available time bound to solve the convex cost integer dual network flow problem.

## 9. Term Structure of Interest Rates and Implied Market Frictions: The Min–Max Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
It is often assumed that financial markets are frictionless. Bond markets are illiquid and bond prices are observed with errors. The magnitude of these errors leads to violation of no–arbitrage conditions and, consequently, prevents researchers from obtaining an estimate of the term structure (TS) of interest rates. Researchers have had to settle for a second–best estimate of the TS (e.g., obtained via regression) at a cost of an economically unrealistic assumption of symmetric market frictions. The true shape of market frictions, however, is not known and generally is a highly complex issue. A no–arbitrage–based methodology that avoids making detrimental assumptions is developed here. It facilitates empirical investigation of the shape of the market frictions and of the TS that are simultaneously imputed from market data assuming “efficient” market frictions that minimize the maximum net arbitrage. The empirical investigation performed in the Canadian and U.S. markets shows that in both markets the frictions are asymmetric and the estimates of the TS produced via regression and our methodology significantly differ.

## 10. The Data of Levy and Levy (2002) “Prospect Theory: Much Ado About Nothing?” Actually Support Prospect Theory
### Author(s):
- Peter P. Wakker
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2003
### Abstract:
Levy and Levy (Management Science2002) present data that, according to their claims, violate prospect theory. They suggest that prospect theory's hypothesis of an S-shaped value function, concave for gains and convex for losses, is incorrect. However, all the data of Levy and Levy are perfectly consistent with the predictions of prospect theory, as can be verified by simply applying prospect theory formulas. The mistake of Levy and Levy is that they, incorrectly, thought that probability weighting could be ignored.
