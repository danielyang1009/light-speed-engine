## 1. E-Business and Management Science: Mutual Impacts (Part 1 of 2)
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2003
### Abstract:
This begins a two-part commentary on management science and e-business, the theme of this two-part special issue. After explaining the topical clusters that give organization to both parts, we pose two key questions concerning the impact of the emerging digital economy on management science research: What fundamentally new research questions arise, and what kind of research enables progress on them. We sketch the papers appearing in this part from the perspective of both these questions, and offer summary comments on the first question based on the papers in both parts. The principal conclusion is that the digital economy is giving birth to new research questions in three main ways (not all independent): by enabling and popularizing several types of technology-mediated interactions, by spawning large-scale digital data sources, and by creating recurring operational decisions that need to be automated.

### Abstract:
The benefits of dynamic pricing methods have long been known in industries, such as airlines, hotels, and electric utilities, where the capacity is fixed in the short-term and perishable. In recent years, there has been an increasing adoption of dynamic pricing policies in retail and other industries, where the sellers have the ability to store inventory. Three factors contributed to this phenomenon: (1) the increased availability of demand data, (2) the ease of changing prices due to new technologies, and (3) the availability of decision-support tools for analyzing demand data and for dynamic pricing. This paper constitutes a review of the literature and current practices in dynamic pricing. Given its applicability in most markets and its increasing adoption in practice, our focus is on dynamic (intertemporal) pricing in the presence of inventory considerations.

## 3. Internet-Based Virtual Stock Markets for Business Forecasting
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
The application of Internet–based virtual stock markets (VSMs) is an additional approach that can be used to predict short– and medium–term market developments. The basic concept involves bringing a group of participants together via the Internet and allowing them to trade shares of virtual stocks. These stocks represent a bet on the outcome of future market situations, and their value depends on the realization of these market situations. In this process, a VSM elicits and aggregates the assessments of its participants concerning future market developments. The aim of this article is to evaluate the potential use and the different design possibilities as well as the forecast accuracy and performance of VSMs compared to expert predictions for their application to business forecasting. After introducing the basic idea of using VSMs for business forecasting, we discuss the different design possibilities for such VSMs. In three real–world applications, we analyze the feasibility and forecast accuracy of VSMs, compare the performance of VSMs to expert predictions, and propose a new validity test for VSM forecasts. Finally, we draw conclusions and provide suggestions for future research.

## 4. On the Use of Optimization for Data Mining: Theoretical Interactions and eCRM Opportunities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2003
### Abstract:
Previous work on the solution to analytical electronic customer relationship management (eCRM) problems has used either data-mining (DM) or optimization methods, but has not combined the two approaches. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, the eCRM problems of customer analysis, customer interactions, and the optimization of performance metrics (such as the lifetime value of a customer on the Web) can be better analyzed. In particular, many eCRM problems have been traditionally addressed using DM methods. There are opportunities for optimization to improve these methods, and this paper describes these opportunities. Further, an online appendix (mansci.pubs.informs.org/ecompanion.html) describes how DM methods can help optimization-based approaches. More generally, this paper argues that the reformulation of eCRM problems within this new framework of analysis can result in more powerful analytical approaches.

## 5. The Role of the Management Sciences in Research on Personalization
### Author(s):
- B. P. S. Murthi
- Sumit Sarkar
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2003
### Abstract:
We present a review of research studies that deal with personalization and synthesize current knowledge about these areas. We identify issues that we envision will be of interest to researchers working in the management sciences, taking an interdisciplinary approach that spans the areas of economics, marketing, information technology (IT), and operations research. We present a framework for personalization that allows us to identify key players in the personalization process as well as key stages of personalization. The framework enables us to examine the strategic role of personalization in the interactions between a firm and other key players in the firm's value system. We conceptualize the personalization process as consisting of three stages: (1) learning about consumer preferences, (2) matching offerings to customers, and (3) evaluation of the learning and matching processes. This review focuses on the learning stage, with an emphasis on utility-based approaches to estimate preference functions using data on customer interactions with a firm.

## 6. Revenue Management and E-Commerce
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2003
### Abstract:
We trace the history of revenue management in an effort to illustrate a successful e–commerce model of dynamic, automated sales. Our discourse begins with a brief overview of electronic distribution as practiced in the airline industry, emphasizing the fundamental role of central reservation and revenue management systems. Methods for controlling the sale of inventory are then introduced along with related techniques for optimization and forecasting. Research contributions and areas of significant research potential are given special attention. We conclude by looking at how revenue management is practiced outside of the airline industry, its relationship to dynamic pricing, and future directions for the discipline.

### Abstract:
Supply chain management is likely to play an important role in the digital economy. In this paper, we first describe major issues in traditional supply chain management. Next, we focus our attention on the supply chain issues of visibility, supplier relationships, distribution and pricing, customization, and real-time decision technologies that have risen to importance with the prevalence of e-business. We present an overview of relevant analytical research models that have been developed in these areas, discuss their contributions, and conclude with a discussion on future modeling opportunities in this area.

## 8. The Digitization of Word of Mouth: Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms
### Author(s):
- Chrysanthos Dellarocas
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2003
### Abstract:
Online feedback mechanisms harness the bidirectional communication capabilities of the Internet to engineer large-scale, word-of-mouth networks. Best known so far as a technology for building trust and fostering cooperation in online marketplaces, such as eBay, these mechanisms are poised to have a much wider impact on organizations. Their growing popularity has potentially important implications for a wide range of management activities such as brand building, customer acquisition and retention, product development, and quality assurance. This paper surveys our progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that these mechanisms represent. It discusses some important dimensions in which Internet-based feedback mechanisms differ from traditional word-of-mouth networks and surveys the most important issues related to their design, evaluation, and use. It provides an overview of relevant work in game theory and economics on the topic of reputation. It discusses how this body of work is being extended and combined with insights from computer science, management science, sociology, and psychology to take into consideration the special properties of online environments. Finally, it identifies opportunities that this new area presents for operations research/management science (OR/MS) research.

### Abstract:
The Internet is growing rapidly in terms of both use and infrastructure. Unfortunately, demand is outpacing the capacity of the infrastructure, as evidenced by unacceptably long response times. To support current load and further growth, we must address this problem. Several caching strategies have been proposed in the literature; many have been implemented to improve the quality of service on the Web. In this paper, we identify the main causes of delay on the Web, and provide a review of the various caching strategies employed to mitigate these delays. We also survey the application of Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) techniques to caching on the Web. Finally, we identify several open OR/MS research problems related to Web caching.
