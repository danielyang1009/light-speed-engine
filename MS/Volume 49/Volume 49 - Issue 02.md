## 2. Innovation and Strategic Divergence: An Empirical Study of the U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry from 1920 to 1960
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Today, firms employing two distinct survival strategies—(1) innovation and (2) imitation —coexist in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. History indicates that this intraindustry heterogeneity did not exist prior to 1940. This study empirically investigates the origin of this strategic divergence by focusing on changes in firms' R&D inputs and outputs. It finds that some U.S. pharmaceutical firms responded to the opportunity presented by the discovery of antibiotics in the 1940s by investing more in R&D, while many others did not. Over time, the innovators dominated in developing new drugs, and the gap between innovators and imitators steadily increased. These findings also shed light on “the genesis of strategic groups,” a phenomenon that is not yet well understood.

## 3. Relative Performance of Incentive Mechanisms: Computational Modeling and Simulation of Delegated Investment Decisions

### Abstract:
This paper evaluates the relative performances of several well–known and widely–used incentive mechanisms under controlled experimental conditions. The scenario utilized is a delegated investment setting where effort and risk aversions contribute to moral hazard among fund managers. Analytical intractability of the problem requires a computational modeling approach to simulate comparative solutions for specific contracts under different parametric settings. Through a simulation exercise, we consider multiple agents who decide their investment strategy over several consecutive periods. Agents learn about estimation and market uncertainty through repeated realizations of investment returns. In each sequence of periods, a number of different incentive mechanisms based on the agent's communication and/or outcome are considered. Results of the computational experiments are presented. Our results overwhelmingly show the efficacy of the incentive contracts in improving the welfare of the investors. In the presence of an estimation risk, when agents learn from their past performances, the market volatility interacts with the estimation risk that makes risk–sharing arrangements such as limited liability overly important. Paying the agent to assume the risk may no longer lead to the best performance incentives.

## 4. A Bayesian Model for Prelaunch Sales Forecasting of Recorded Music

### Abstract:
In a situation where several hundred new music albums are released each month, producing sales forecasts in a reliable and consistent manner is a rather difficult and cumbersome task. The purpose of this study is to obtain sales forecasts for a new album before it is introduced. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model based on a logistic diffusion process. It allows for the generalization of various adoption patterns out of discrete data and can be applied in a situation where the eventual number of adopters is unknown. Using sales of previous albums along with information known prior to the launch of a new album, the model constructs informed priors, yielding prelaunch sales forecasts, which are out-of-sample predictions. In the context of new product forecasting before introduction, the information we have is limited to the relevant background characteristics of a new album. Knowing only the general attributes of a new album, the meta-analytic approach proposed here provides an informed prior on the dynamics of duration, the effects of marketing variables, and the unknown market potential. As new data become available, weekly sales forecasts and market size (number of eventual adopters) are revised and updated. We illustrate our approach using weekly sales data of albums that appeared inBillboard'sTop 200 albums chart from January 1994 to December 1995.

## 5. The Financial Rewards of New Product Introductions in the Personal Computer Industry

### Abstract:
Based on data from firms in the personal computer industry, we study the effect of new product introductions on three key drivers of firm value: profit rate, profit-rate persistence, and firm size as reflected in asset growth. Consistent with our theoretical development, we find that new product introductions influence profit rate and size; however, we find no effect on profit-rate persistence. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of new product introductions on profit rate stems from a reduction in selling and general administrative expenditure intensity rather than through an increase in gross operating return. Notably, firms decrease their advertising intensity in the wake of a new product introduction. Firm profitability in this industry apparently benefits from new product introductions because new products need less marketing support than older products.

## 6. Old Is Gold? The Value of Temporal Exploration in the Creation of New Knowledge
### Author(s):
- Atul Nerkar
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2003
### Abstract:
In this paper, knowledge creation is considered as a path-dependent evolutionary process that involves recombining knowledge spread over time. The findings of the paper suggest that a balance in combining current knowledge with the knowledge available across large time spans is an important factor that explains the impact of new knowledge. These ideas are empirically tested using patent data from the pharmaceutical industry. Results from the analysis offer support for the hypotheses developed in the paper.

## 7. Probabilistic Error Bounds for Simulation Quantile Estimators

### Abstract:
Quantile estimation has become increasingly important, particularly in the financial industry, where value at risk (VaR) has emerged as a standard measurement tool for controlling portfolio risk. In this paper, we analyze the probability that a simulation-based quantile estimator fails to lie in a prespecified neighborhood of the true quantile. First, we show that this error probability converges to zero exponentially fast with sample size for negatively dependent sampling. Then we consider stratified quantile estimators and show that the error probability for these estimators can be guaranteed to be 0 with sufficiently large, but finite, sample size. These estimators, however, require sample sizes that grow exponentially in the problem dimension. Numerical experiments on a simple VaR example illustrate the potential for variance reduction.

## 8. Note: Optimal Policies for Serial Inventory Systems Under Fill Rate Constraints
### Author(s):
- Sven Axsäter
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2003
### Abstract:
A continuous review serial production/distribution system with discrete compound Poisson demand for the end product is considered. Unmet demand is back-ordered. Production/transportation times are constant. All deliveries from one stage to the next must be multiples of given batch sizes. We consider the problem of minimizing the holding costs under a fill rate constraint. Using recent results by Chen (2000), we show that under a set of restricted but plausible assumptions, the optimal policy is an echelon stock multistage (R, nQ) policy with one of the reorder points varying over time. We provide a simple procedure for the determination of the optimal policy.
