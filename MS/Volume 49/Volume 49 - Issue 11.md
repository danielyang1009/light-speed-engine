## 1. E-Business and Management Science: Mutual Impacts (Part 2 of 2)
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
This concludes a two-part commentary on management science and e-business, the theme of this two-part special issue. After reviewing the topical clusters that give organization to both parts, we sketch the papers appearing in this second part from the perspective of two key questions concerning the impact of the emerging digital economy on management science research: What fundamentally new research questions arise, and what kind of research enables progress on them. We then offer summary comments on the second question based on the papers in both parts. The principal conclusions are that, in meeting the challenges posed by the digital economy, management science researchers are (a) making greater use of parts of economics and computer science/information technology, and (b) exploiting the improving productivity advantages of empirical and methodological work in comparison with theoretical work.

## 2. Managing Online Auctions: Current Business and Research Issues
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
The Internet's computational power and flexibility have made auctions a widespread and integral part of both consumer and business markets. Though online auctions are a multi-billion dollar annual activity, with a growing variety of sophisticated trading mechanisms, scientific research on them is at an early stage. This paper analyzes the current state of management science research on online auctions. It develops a broad research agenda for issues such as the behavior of online auction participants, the optimal design of online auctions, the integration of auctions into the ongoing operation of firms, and the use of the data generated by online auctions to inform future trading mechanisms. These research areas will draw from applied and theoretical work spanning management science, economics, and information systems.

## 3. Combinatorial Auction Design

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
Combinatorial auctions have two features that greatly affect their design: computational complexity of winner determination and opportunities for cooperation among competitors. Dealing with these forces trade-offs between desirable auction properties such as allocative efficiency, revenue maximization, low transaction costs, fairness, failure freeness, and scalability. Computational complexity can be dealt with algorithmically by relegating the computational burden to bidders, by maintaining fairness in the face of computational limitations, by limiting biddable combinations, and by limiting the use of combinatorial bids. Combinatorial auction designs include single-round, first-price sealed bidding, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms, uniform and market-clearing price auctions, and iterative combinatorial auctions. Combinatorial auction designs must deal with exposure problems, threshold problems, ways to keep the bidding moving at a reasonable pace, avoiding and resolving ties, and controlling complexity.

## 4. Costly Bidding in Online Markets for IT Services
### Author(s):
- Eli M. Snir
- Lorin M. Hitt
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
Internet-enabled markets are becoming viable venues for procurement of professional services. We investigate bidding behavior within the most active area of these early knowledge markets—the market for software development. These markets are important both because they provide an early view of the effectiveness of online service markets and because they have a potentially large impact on how software development services are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and transaction behavior, taking into account costly bidding. We then test our model using data from an active online market for software development services, which yields contracts for 30%–40% of posted projects. In its current format, however, the studied market may induce excessive bidding by vendors. Consistent with our theoretical predictions and those of Carr (2003), higher-value projects attract significantly more bids, with lower average quality. Greater numbers of bids raise the cost to all participants, due to costly bidding and bid evaluation. Perhaps as a consequence, higher-value projects are also much less likely to be awarded.

## 5. Note on Online Auctions with Costly Bid Evaluation
### Author(s):
- Scott M. Carr
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
As seen in the data of Snir and Hitt (2003), online service procurement auctions often end without achieving a contract despite active bidding, yet the existing auction literature is silent on why this occurs. One explanation for these unconsummated auctions may be that perfectly acceptable bids are submitted but disregarded because of the cost of assessing the bids' viability and the bidders' capabilities. This note examines this possibility by characterizing optimal and equilibrium bidding and bid-evaluation decisions in the presence of these costs.

## 6. An Inverse-Optimization-Based Auction Mechanism to Support a Multiattribute RFQ Process
### Author(s):
- Damian R. Beil
- Lawrence M. Wein
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
We consider a manufacturer who uses a reverse, or procurement, auction to determine which supplier will be awarded a contract. Each bid consists of a price and a set of nonprice attributes (e.g., quality, lead time). The manufacturer is assumed to know the parametric form of the suppliers' cost functions (in terms of the nonprice attributes), but has no prior information on the parameter values. We construct a multiround open-ascending auction mechanism, where the manufacturer announces a slightly different scoring rule (i.e., a function that ranks the bids in terms of the price and nonprice attributes) in each round. Via inverse optimization, the manufacturer uses the bids from the first several rounds to learn the suppliers' cost functions, and then in the final round chooses a scoring rule that attempts to maximize his own utility. Under the assumption that suppliers submit their myopic best-response bids in the last round, and do not distort their bids in the earlier rounds (i.e., they choose their minimum-cost bid to achieve any given score), our mechanism, indeed, maximizes the manufacturer's utility within the open-ascending format. We also discuss several enhancements that improve the robustness of our mechanism with respect to the model's informational and behavioral assumptions.

## 7. Group Buying on the Web: A Comparison of Price-Discovery Mechanisms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
Web-based group-buying mechanisms are being widely used for both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. We survey currently operational online group-buying markets, and then study this phenomenon using analytical models. We build on the literatures in information economics and operations management in our analytical model of a monopolist offering Web-based group-buying under different kinds of demand uncertainty. We derive the monopolist's optimal group-buying schedule under varying conditions of heterogeneity in the demand regimes, and compare its profits with those that obtain under the more conventional posted-price mechanism. We further study the impact of production postponement by endogenizing the timing of the pricing and production decisions in a two-stage game between the monopolist and buyers. Our results have implications for firms' choice of price-discovery mechanisms in e-markets, and for the scheduling of production and pricing decisions in the presence (and absence) of scale economies of production.

## 8. Measuring the Frictional Costs of Online Transactions: The Case of a Name-Your-Own-Price Channel
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
We study the offers submitted by consumers to a large Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) online retailer. A distinctive feature of this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round, such a strategy would require them to go through many additional online transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction, such as submitting an offer. Thus, in our setting, consumers trade off a direct financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer choice model capturing this trade-off, we use the observed consumer behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers in our sample. We show that, perhaps contrary to the general wisdom, frictional costs in electronic markets are substantial, with median values ranging from EUR 3.54 for a portable digital music player (MP3) to EUR 6.08 for a personal digital assistant (PDA). We find that consumers who have gathered experience with the NYOP channel in previous transactions exhibit lower frictional costs than consumers who use the channel for the first time. Surprisingly, sociodemographic variables do not help to explain the variation in frictional costs.

- Michael D. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
We present a framework and empirical estimates that quantify the economic impact of increased product variety made available through electronic markets. While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains.

## 10. Integrating Long- and Short-Term Contracting via Business-to-Business Exchanges for Capital-Intensive Industries
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2003
### Abstract:
This paper surveys the underlying theory and practice in the use of options in support of emerging business-to-business (B2B) markets. Such options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in integrating long- and short-term contracting between multiple buyers and sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits. Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B transactions. This paper notes broad set of goods and services currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost economics, and we use this framework to provide review and synthesis of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries. The paper concludes with a discussion of implementation challenges and open research questions.
