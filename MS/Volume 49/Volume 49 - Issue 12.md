### Abstract:
Many clinics that offer in vitro fertilization (IVF) have begun to market the following options to couples: (1) an a la carte program where the couple pays $7,500 per attempt regardless of the outcome; or (2) a money-back-guarantee program where the couple pays a $15,000 fee that covers up to three attempts, however, if after three cycles there is no live-birth delivery, then the full $15,000 is refunded.

## 2. Good Reasons Sell: Reason-Based Choice Among Group and Individual Investors in the Stock Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2003
### Abstract:
In this paper, we compare the investment decisions of groups (stock clubs) and individuals. Both individuals and clubs are more likely to purchase stocks that are associated with good reasons (e.g., a company that is featured on a list of most-admired companies). However, stock clubs favor such stocks more than individuals, despite the fact that such reasons do not improve performance. We describe why social dynamics may make good reasons more important for groups than individuals.

### Abstract:
We consider the order-fulfillment process of a supplier producing a customized capital good, such as production equipment, commercial aircraft, medical devices, or defense systems. As is common in these industries, prior to receiving a firm purchase order from the customer, the supplier receives a series of shared forecasts, which are called “soft orders.” Facing a stochastic internal manufacturing lead time, the supplier must decide at what time to begin the fulfillment of the order. This decision requires a trade-off between starting too early, leading to potential holding or cancellation costs, and starting too late, leading to potential delay costs. We collect detailed data of shared forecasts, actual purchase orders, production lead times, and delivery dates for a supplier-buyer dyad in the semiconductor equipment supply chain. Under the assumption that the supplier acts rationally, optimally balancing the cancellation, holding, and delay costs, we are able to estimate the corresponding imputed cost parameters based on the observed data. Our estimation results reveal that the supplier perceives the cost of cancellation to be about two times higher and the holding costs to be about three times higher than the delay cost. In other words, the supplier is very conservative when commencing the order fulfillment, which undermines the effectiveness of the overall forecast-sharing mechanism.

### Abstract:
We study the determinants of contract choice in offshore software development projects and examine how the choice of contract and other factors in the project affect project profits accruing to the software vendor. Using data collected on 93 offshore projects from a leading Indian software vendor, we provide evidence that specific vendor-, client-, and project-related characteristics such as requirement uncertainty, project team size, and resource shortage significantly explain contract choice in these projects. Our analysis suggests that contract choice significantly determines project profit. Additionally, some ex ante vendor-, client-, and project-related characteristics known at the time of choosing the contract continue to significantly influence project profits after controlling for contract choice. We also provide evidence to show that project duration and team size affect project profits.

## 5. Safeguarding Interorganizational Performance and Continuity Under Ex Post Opportunism
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Opportunism is a central construct in exchange theory. Economists contend that despite the firm's best efforts to erect governance structures that reduce opportunism and preserve outcomes, there is always some opportunism that remains once the transaction is in place. Despite this, there are few studies that systematically investigate the safeguarding efficacy of relationship attributes in the presence of such ex post opportunism. In this research, we develop a theoretical framework and provide a longitudinal test of the ability of various relationship safeguards to preserve performance outcomes and future expectations given varying levels of ex post opportunism in the relationship. Our survey results from over 300 buyers and suppliers indicates that given lower levels of opportunism, bilateral idiosyncratic investments and interpersonal trust enhance performance outcomes and future expectations, while goal congruence has no discernable effect. However, at higher levels of opportunism, goal congruence becomes a more powerful safeguard, while interpersonal trust becomes less effective. Bilateral idiosyncratic investments continue to preserve performance outcomes and future expectations even at higher levels of opportunism. Implications for the long-term management of interorganizational alliances are discussed.

## 6. Social Networks in Organizational Emergence: The University Spinout Phenomenon
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2003
### Abstract:
This paper aims to ascertain the influence of social networks in the university spinout phenomenon. With respect to the instrumental role of social networks, it adopts a content contingency perspective pertaining to the role of closure and structural holes, and examines the interaction between relational and structural embeddedness in the academics' network structure. With respect to spinout outcomes, this paper distinguishes between academic exodus and stasis, and differentiates between types of spinouts based on the degree of involvement of the key academics. It also examines networks at the team level of analysis and submits that team-level structural differences exist between the different spinout structures.

## 7. An Interactive Evolutionary Metaheuristic for Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2003
### Abstract:
We propose an evolutionary metaheuristic for multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems that interacts with the decision maker (DM) to guide the search effort toward his or her preferred solutions. Solutions are presented to the DM, whose pairwise comparisons are then used to estimate the desirability or fitness of newly generated solutions. The evolutionary algorithm comprising the skeleton of the metaheuristic makes use of selection strategies specifically designed to address the multiobjective nature of the problem. Interactions with the DM are triggered by a probabilistic evaluation of estimated fitnesses, while memory structures with indifference thresholds restrict the presentation of solutions resembling those that have already been rejected. The algorithm has been tested on a number of random instances of the Multiobjective Knapsack Problem (MOKP) and the Multiobjective Spanning Tree Problem (MOST). Simulation results indicate that the algorithm requires only a small number of comparisons to be made for satisfactory solutions to be found.

### Abstract:
Motivated by a project in health-care management, we study the resource allocation problem in multisite service systems with intersite customer flows. We aim at providing insights to and guidelines for resource allocation in these service systems when some service criterion, such as average waiting time, loss rate, or blocking probability, is a major concern. We develop analytical optimization models and from them we obtain the explicit optimal allocation policy. Our results demonstrate that the optimal resource allocation solution exhibits a structure of “one large and many small.”

## 9. A Comment on “Price-Endings When Prices Signal Quality”
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Stiving (2000) proposes an interesting model to explain price-endings. His analysis shows that even when customer demand increases at 9-ending price points, certain firms that use high prices to signal quality are more likely to set those prices at round numbers. This comment raises two issues about the model. First, it appears that the original paper imposes a condition that has the effect of eliminating a broad range of legitimate separating equilibria from the analyses. Second, it appears that the original model does not include constraints to ensure that the demand for each market segment will be nonnegative. When these constraints on demand are included, one obtains different aggregate demand curves, which leads to different equilibrium prices. Using the revised model and analysis, we find that 71% of the prices end in 9 and only 12% in 0. This contrasts with only 3% ending in 9 and 58% ending in 0 for the original study. Therefore, 9-endings still prevail even though high prices can be used by firms to signal high quality.

## 10. Reply to “A Comment on ‘Price-Endings When Prices Signal Quality’”
### Author(s):
- Mark Stiving
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2003
### Abstract:
Although the comment provides some additional insight, it in no way diminishes the contribution of the original paper. That paper is the first and only theoretical explanation for why firms behave as though they use round prices to signal quality. Further, the paper provides empirical evidence in support of this explanation.
