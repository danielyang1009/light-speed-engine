## 1. Inventory Optimization in the U.S. Petroleum Industry: Empirical Analysis and Implications for Energy Emergency Policy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
Much of the rapid increases in the price of crude oil during two of the last three supply shocks has been attributed to increased private inventory demand stimulated by the expectation of speculative profits. Government intervention in any future disruption is likely to take the form of releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Given that the SPR accounts for but a small fraction of U.S. oil inventories, the reaction of the private sector is critical in evaluating its impact. We incorporate inventory behavior in a model of the world oil market, which is then linked to a short-run macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy. Our model simulations support the view that substantial inventory accumulation accompanies a supply disruption. In the debate over whether the SPR is potentially a potent or impotent resource in an emergency, we lean toward potency. Our model suggests that public releases will not be absorbed in private stockpiles; indeed, their dampening price effects will serve, albeit slightly, to discourage speculative stock build.

## 2. Lead Users: A Source of Novel Product Concepts
### Author(s):
- Eric von Hippel
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
Accurate marketing research depends on accurate user judgments regarding their needs. However, for very novel products or in product categories characterized by rapid changesuch as high technology productsmost potential users will not have the real-world experience needed to problem solve and provide accurate data to inquiring market researchers. In this paper I explore the problem and propose a solution: Marketing research analyses which focus on what I term the lead users of a product or process.

## 3. New Product Strategy in Small Technology-Based Firms: A Pilot Study
### Author(s):

- Edward B. Roberts
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
A pilot test is reported on a method for relating the degree of newness within a firm's portfolio of products and the firm's economic success. The embodied technology and market applications newness is measured in the sequences of 79 products developed and released by a sample of 10 small technology-based companies, each under $50 million in most recent sales. A two-dimensional technology newness/market newness grid is prepared for the product set of each firm, based on the conditions existent at the time of each product's development. Alternative weighting schemes are used to generate a newness index for each firm. The degree of strategic focus is shown to relate directly to corporate growth in that small firms with more restricted degrees of technological and market change in their successive products outperform companies with wide diversity. The evidence suggests, however, that some product newness is better than no newness, and that more technological change can be effectively employed in small company product strategy than market change.

## 4. The Relation Between Research and Development Project Performance and Technical Communication in a Developing CountryAfghanistan
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
This study examines the effects of frequency and centrality of communication on research and development project success. The data used in this study are from 49 government funded R & D projects in Afghanistan during 1979. The results of the multivariate analyses show that frequency of communication is positively correlated with performance for mid and high performing groups, centrality or location of the project within the communications network is negatively related with project performance within the low performance category. The results are consistent with the evidence thus far obtained for developed countries. There appears to be little difference in the effects of centrality and frequency of communication on the performance between research and development projects. This result is not consistent with the available evidence for developed countries. The results of the regressions on the socio-metric data suggest age are negatively correlated with communication centrality. This is due to the particular circumstances found in 1979 in Afghanistan where the older scholars were typically trained in the region while the younger scholars were mostly Western trained. While conceptually this study is indebted to the research concerning developed countries, these results imply that caution is mandated in generalizing the given body of knowledge to developing countries.

## 5. The Marriage Tax
### Author(s):
- Jane M. Fraser
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
The design of tax laws is difficult because we have conflicting goals concerning our tax system. Policy makers often struggle to meet the demands of various groups without knowing exactly what tradeoffs are logically possible or impossible. The relative taxation of married couples and single persons is one area where tax design is difficult. This paper proves that it is impossible to have a tax system that simultaneously (1) is marriage neutral, (2) pools incomes within a married couple, and (3) maintains a nonlinear tax function. The paper explores the logical implications of abandoning any one of these three principles.

## 6. Axiomatic Foundation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process
### Author(s):
- Thomas L. Saaty
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
This paper contains an axiomatic treatment of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The set of axioms corresponding to hierarchic structures are a special case of axioms for priority setting in systems with feedback which allow for a wide class of dependencies. The axioms highlight: (1) the reciprocal property that is basic in making paired comparisons; (2) homogeneity that is characteristic of people's ability for making comparisons among things that are not too dissimilar with respect to a common property and, hence, the need for arranging them within an order preserving hierarchy; (3) dependence of a lower level on the adjacent higher level; (4) the idea that an outcome can only reflect expectations when the latter are well represented in the hierarchy. The AHP neither assumes transitivity (or the stronger condition of consistency) nor does it include strong assumptions of the usual notions of rationality. A number of facts are derived from these axioms providing an operational basis for the AHP.

## 7. Improved Penalties for Fixed Cost Linear Programs Using Lagrangean Relaxation
### Author(s):
- A. Victor Cabot
- S. Selcuk Erenguc
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
The most commonly used penalty in branch and bound approaches to integer programming is the DriebeekTomlin penalty. It has been used successfully in solving fixed cost linear programs by Kennington and Unger and by Barr, Glover and Klingman. It is well known that the DriebeekTomlin penalty can be derived from a Lagrangean relaxation of the integer programming problem. We show, however, that the Lagrangean relaxation for fixed cost problems not only yields the DriebeekTomlin penalty, but two penalties which sometimes dominate it. We show the strength of the new penalties by solving a series of text problems and comparing the number of nodes generated on the branch and bound tree and the total computer time needed to solve each problem.

## 8. True Interest Cost in Municipal Bond Bidding: An Integer Programming Approach
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Nauss
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
Over $47 billion of tax exempt debt issues were sold to the public in 1982. A portion of this total was offered to municipal bond underwriters under a competitive bidding system using the criterion of minimum true interest cost (internal rate of return). The TIC bidding problem may be formulated as a nonlinear integer program. We develop a linearization which is embedded in a special purpose integer linear branch and bound algorithm. Computational results for several actual bidding problems are presented.

## 9. An Adaptive Filter for Estimating Spatially-Varying Parameters: Application to Modeling Police Hours Spent in Response to Calls for Service
### Author(s):
- Stuart A. Foster
- Wilpen L. Gorr
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
The Spatial Adaptive Filter (SAF), introduced in this paper, uses generalized damped negative feedback to estimate spatially-varying parameters for multivariate models. Previous adaptive filters have been designed to estimate time-varying parameters and process data recursively in time sequence. SAF processes all data simultaneously in an iterative algorithm. Monte Carlo studies show that SAF is successful in automatically identifying and estimating step-jump and continuous spatial variation in the parameters of causal variables. A case study on census-tract data from Columbus, Ohio, relating police-vehicle hours spent in responding to calls to socio-economic indicators, has systematic spatial variation in estimated parameters. Independent variables that are significant in inner-city areas of Columbus become progressively less significant in moving to outlying areas.

## 10. Flexible Manufacturing Systems: A Review of Analytical Models
### Author(s):
- J. A. Buzacott
- David D. Yao
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1986
### Abstract:
This paper reviews recent work on the development of analytical models of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs). The contributions of each of the groups concerned with model development are summarized and an assessment is made of the strengths and weaknesses of its modelling approach. A number of directions in which models require extension are outlined, in particular the representation of such aspects of FMS operation as the tool delivery systems, the blocking phenomenon, the transient behavior and the differences between flexible machining systems and flexible assembly systems. Further work is also required on the structure of FMS control and the integration with plant production planning and control.
