### Abstract:
Judgement based forecasts are widely used in practice either alone or in conjunction with computer prepared forecasts. This study empirically examines the improvement in accuracy which can be gained from combining judgemental forecasts, either with other judgemental or with quantitatively derived forecasts. Two judgemental forecasting approaches are used by each of two different groups in a laboratory setting to give four sets of judgemental forecasts for the 68 monthly time series of the M-competition. These are combined either with each other or with forecasts from deseasonalised single exponential smoothing. Combined forecasts are found to be more accurate than single forecasts with the greatest benefit realised at short forecast horizons and for easier (as opposed to harder) forecast series. Averaging was observed to be a far better way of combining judgemental forecasts than a judgemental, nonsystematic combination.

## 2. Bidding for Contracts
### Author(s):
- William Samuelson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
In a competitive procurement, a buyer seeks to institute a bidding and contracting procedure which selects the most efficient firm to undertake the contract while offering terms that promote risk sharing between buyer and contractor. This paper develops a model to analyze formally the trade-off between the objectives of risk sharing and efficient contractor selection.

## 3. Final-Offer Arbitration
### Author(s):
- Donald Wittman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
In final-offer arbitration the two parties to a dispute submit final offers to an arbitrator. The arbitrator then chooses as the binding solution that offer which is closest to his own view of the appropriate outcome. Because the disputants are imperfectly informed about the arbitrator's preferences, final-offer arbitration can be modeled as a game of imperfect information. Interesting questions arise concerning the nature of the optimal strategies and how they are affected by different characteristics of the arbitrator and the disputants.

## 4. A Special Case of Dynamic Pricing Policy
### Author(s):
- Birger Wernerfelt
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
This article studies the implications of experience curves and brand loyalty for optimal dynamic pricing policy. In a continuous time model, we synthesize several results from the literature on open loop equilibria. Specifically, we show that prices should decrease over time for high discount rates and steeper exogenous declines in variable costs. Conversely, the prices should increase over time if experience curves affect fixed costs and if consumers are brand loyal.

## 5. Batch Size and Stocking Levels in Multi-Echelon Repairable Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
In multi-echelon repairable inventory systems with high set-up cost for order and/or high demand rates, the use of batch ordering may be more cost-effective than the common (S  1, S) ordering policy. This paper addresses the issue of determining the optimal order batch size and stocking levels at the stocking locations in such a system. A power approximation is used to estimate the total system stock and backorder levels from which the optimal batch size can be readily determined. A search routine involving one-pass searches are then followed to obtain the stocking levels at the depot and the local sites of the system. This procedure has been evaluated using 900 test cases and has been found to be very effective. The power approximation approach also results in a simple analytical relationship to test whether or not (S  1, S) is an optimal ordering policy for repairable items in a multi-echelon environment.

## 6. A Primal Simplex Approach to Pure Processing Networks
### Author(s):
- Chou-Hong J. Chen
- Michael Engquist
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
Pure processing network problems are minimum cost flow problems in which the flow entering or leaving a node may be constrained to do so in given proportions. In this paper, new theoretical results concerning pure processing networks are developed, and, based on these results, two new primal simplex variants are presented. One of these variants has been implemented and tested against a general purpose linear programming code. A large class of problems is identified for which the specialized code is an order of magnitude faster than the general purpose code.

## 7. Multi-Object Auctions: Sequential vs. Simultaneous Sales
### Author(s):
- Donald B. Hausch
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
Would a seller prefer to sell multiple objects through sequential or simultaneous auctions? Sequential auctions with bids announced between sales seem preferable because the bids may convey information about the value of objects to be sold later. The auction literature shows that this information effect increases the sellers expected revenue. However, there is also a deception effect which develops in the sequential sales. If a bidder knows that his current bid will reveal information about later objects then he has an incentive to underbid. These two opposing effects are studied in a two-signal model. The results show that either effect may dominate the other, leading the seller to sometimes prefer simultaneous sales and to sometimes prefer sequential sales. The winner's curse can explain this ordering.

## 8. Comment on Multi-Object Auctions: Sequential vs. Simultaneous Sales
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
The purpose of this brief comment is to provide some empirical data to support the relevance of the theoretical arguments put forward in Donald Hauschs paper (Hausch, Donald B. 1986. Multi-object auctions: sequential vs. simultaneous sales. Management Sci.32.). There are two different kinds of evidence. One is the results of a small natural experiment that occurred in 1965. The other is the first-hand report by one of us of the considerations taken into account in the design of outer continental shelf (OCS) oil auctions.

## 9. The Use of Categorical Variables in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Rajiv D. Banker
- Richard C. Morey
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
Data Envelopment Analysis has now been extensively applied in a range of empirical settings to identify relative inefficiencies, and provide targets for improvements. It accomplishes this by developing peer groups for each unit being operated. The use of categorical variables is an important extension which can improve the peer group construction process and incorporate on-off characteristics, e.g., presence of drive-in window or not in a banking network. It relaxes the stringent need for factors to display piecewise constant marginal productivities. In so doing, it substantially strengthens the credibility of the insights obtained. The paper treats the cases when the categorical variable can be controllable or uncontrollable by the manager, for the cases of technical and scale inefficiency. The approach is illustrated using real data.

## 10. A Multiobjective Methodology for Selecting Subsystem Automation Options
### Author(s):
- Jonathan F. Bard
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
When designing large-scale systems, managers and engineers must often balance the desire for optimality with the need for analytic tractability. When new technologies are involved the problem may be further complicated by the need to conduct local tradeoffs among risk, cost, and time factors. In order to formally deal with these issues, this paper presents a decomposition scheme in which individual subsystems may be evaluated separately and a representative set of alternatives obtained for each. In the development, a set of multiple objectives is introduced to account for the range of organizational priorities underlying the decision making process. Pareto-optimal solutions are then found with a general purpose parametric programming algorithm and ranked with the help of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The methodology is demonstrated with an example centering on the selection of automation options for the upcoming Space Station, but is general enough to be applicable to the design of any complex system.

## 11. NoteOrdinal Ranking and Intensity of Preference: A Linear Programming Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
Cook and Kress (Cook, Wade D., Moshe Kress. 1985. Ordinal ranking with intensity of preference. Management Sci.31 (1) 2632.) present a model for representing ordinal preference rankings, where the voter can express intensity or degree of preference. The consensus of a set of m rankings is that ranking whose distance from this set is minimal. The consensus problem is then shown to be an integer programming problem with a piecewise linear convex objective function. In the present note we prove that the constraint matrix for this integer problem is totally unimodular. In addition, it is shown that the problem can be expressed as an equivalent integer linear programming problem. These two facts allow us to represent the consensus problem as a linear programming model. To further facilitate an efficient solution procedure to the consensus problem, it is shown that the number of columns in the L.P. model can generally be reduced significantly. Computational results on a wide range of problems is presented.

## 12. NoteA Note on the Reversibility and Duality of Some Tandem Blocking Queueing Systems
### Author(s):
- Benjamin Melamed
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
In a previous paper Yamazaki et al. (Yamazaki, G., T. Kawashima, H. Sakasegawa. 1983. Reversibility of tandem blocking queueing systems. Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.) prove that a certain tandem blocking queueing system and its reversed counterpart have the same capacity (throughput). The purpose of this note is to offer an alternative viewpoint based on a concept of duality. This leads to a more intuitive methodology and provides additional insight into the original and reversed systems.

## 13. NoteThe Managerial Economics of Civil Litigation: A Note
### Author(s):
- Kofi O. Nti
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1986
### Abstract:
In his paper, The Managerial Economics of Civil Litigation, Levy (Levy, F. K. 1985. The managerial economics of civil litigation. Management Sci.31 (March) 323342.) develops a model to determine the optimal expenditures and maximal budgets for a plaintiff and a defendant in a civil suit. He uses a learning process to relate each litigant's probability of success to his level of expenditure. The specific learning process used is a difference equation where the rate of enhancement of probability is a constant fraction of the maximum possible gain. Levy's analysis would have been simpler if he had formulated that learning process as a differential equation.
