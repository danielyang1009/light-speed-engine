### Author(s):

### Abstract:
An empirical analysis indicates that the order of entry of a brand into a consumer product category is inversely related to its market share. Market share is modeled as a log linear function of order of entry, time between entries, advertising, and positioning effectiveness. The coefficients of the entry, advertising, and positioning variables are significant in a regression analysis on an initial sample of 82 brands across 24 categories. These findings are confirmed by predictions on 47 not previously analyzed brands in 12 categories. Managerial implications for pioneers and later entrants are identified.

## 2. On the Minimum Violations Ranking of a Tournament

### Abstract:
This paper examines the problem of rank ordering a set of players or objects on the basis of a set of pairwise comparisons arising from a tournament. The criterion for deriving this ranking is to have as few cases as possible where player i is ranked above j while i was actually defeated by j in the tournament. Such a situation is referred to as a violation. The objective, therefore, is to determine the Minimum Violations Ranking (MVR). While there are situations where this ranking would be allowed to contain ties among subsets of objects, we will concern ourselves herein with linear ordering (no ties). A series of examples are given where this requirement would seem to be appropriate. In order to put the MVR problem into proper perspective we introduce the concept of a distance on the set of tournaments. A set of natural axioms is presented which any such distance measure should obey, and it is proven that in the presence of these axioms a unique such measure exists. It is then shown that the MVR problem is equivalent to the minimum distance problem, which can be represented in several formsin particular as a problem of determining the minimum feedback edge set in a graph and as a mixed integer generalized network problem. This opens up a wide scope of possible solution procedures for the MVR problem. An optimal algorithm is presented along with computational results. In addition, various heuristics are discussed including an improved heuristic referred to as the Iterated Kendall method.

## 3. Uncertainty, Experience and the Winner's Curse in OCS Lease Bidding
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
This paper presents an empirical test of the major hypothesis of the currently-accepted bidding models in two regions of differing tract value uncertainty. The most significant result is an empirical verification that the more bidders that bid on a particular parcel in the face of great uncertainty, the lower the bid levels of individual firms that participate given all else is constant. No such relationship was observed, however, in the sale where there was previous bidding experience and prior ownership of closely related tracks. Prior models have not been able to identify the inverse relationship because of a bias that occurs when only positive bids are employed in these models and the use of data where previous experience reduces uncertainty. In the analysis of the competitive bidding situation, we use a two-stage procedure which adjusts for this selection bias by allowing for the incorporation of information from the dichotomous bid/no-bid decision in the modeling of bid level.

## 4. Unstable Weights in the Combination of Forecasts
### Author(s):
- Heejoon Kang
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
The weights used in the combination of forecasts are shown to be very unstable. They are generally so unstable that the combined forecasts often do not perform better than some of the individual forecasts or a simple average of the forecasts in practice. The instability is found from a series of Monte Carlo experiments as well as from the nominal GNP forecasts from four well-known macro forecasters. The Monte Carlo experiments also show that when the underlying models are known, a composite forecast from a composite model is generally more accurate than the combination of the individual forecasts. A simple average is shown to be the best technique to use in practice, because the weights in the combination are so unstable.

## 5. The Bias of Schedules and Playoff Systems in Professional Sports
### Author(s):
- Howard J. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
We examine the method used for seeding teams in professional sports leagues after the regular season has ended. In particular, we are interested in which teams are in the playoffs and which of these playoff teams get the home field advantage and/or a first round bye. We show that the regular season schedule is biased against good teams (since teams are separated into divisions) and that in addition to the current schedules and their inherent biases the playoff systems add more bias against good teams (since division winners are typically ranked higher than nondivision winners). The amount of bias in various cases is presented. Furthermore, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a schedule to be completely unbiased. Using this condition we develop schedules which maximize intradivision rivalries while maintaining no bias.

## 6. A Stochastic Inventory Model Incorporating Intra-Year Purchases and Accounting Tax Incentives
### Author(s):
- Gary C. Biddle
- R. Kipp Martin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
It has been observed that firms alter year-end inventory policies in response to accounting tax incentives. This study proposes a stochastic ordering policy model which quantifies these effects. An innovative feature is its use of two decision variables: an initial order-up-to-level at the beginning of each year and a desired year-end inventory level. The ability to place a second order after demand has been assessed allows for an explicit consideration of the effects of tax incentives on order quantity decisions. Separate formulations are developed for the two most widely-used inventory accounting methods, LIFO and FIFO. The model provides new implications for choices between LIFO and FIFO, the forms of optimal ordering policies under each and for year-end inventory levels. A procedure is given for calculating the optimal FIFO policy. Calculating optimal LIFO policies is very difficult so myopic approximate policies are given which bound the optimal policy.

## 7. A Sequencing Problem with Release Dates and Clustered Jobs
### Author(s):
- Marc E. Posner
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
This paper considers a one-machine scheduling problem where the objective is to minimize the sum of weighted completion times subject to release dates. A polynomial time algorithm is developed for the case when the jobs are clustered. The jobs in each cluster must be processed sequentially and the clusters are ordered. The insights developed are used in an efficient heuristic for the weighted completion time problem without clusters. Also, a class of release date problems is described for which the heuristic finds an optimal solution.

## 8. Multiattribute Bayesian Acceptance Sampling Plans Under Nondestructive Inspection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
A methodology for determining optimal sampling plans for Bayesian multiattribute acceptance sampling models is developed. Inspections are assumed to be nondestructive and attributes are classified as scrappable or screenable according to the corrective action required when a lot is rejected on a given attribute. The effects of interactions among attributes on the resulting optimal sampling plan are examined and show that: (1) sampling plans for screenable attributes can be obtained by solving a set of independent single attribute models, (2) interactions of scrappable attributes on screenable attributes and conversely result in smaller sample sizes for screenable attributes than in single attribute plans, and (3) interactions among scrappable attributes result in either smaller sample sizes, lower acceptance probabilities or both, relative to single attribute plans. An iterative subproblem algorithm is developed, which is effective in finding near optimal multiattribute sampling plans having a large number of attributes.

## 9. A Two-Moment Approximation for the Mean Waiting Time in the GI/G/s Queue
### Author(s):
- Toshikazu Kimura
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
We provide a simple two-moment approximation formula for the mean waiting time in a GI/G/s queue. This formula has the form of a certain combination of the exact mean waiting times for the D/M/s, M/D/s and M/M/s queues, and hence it can be easily calculated by using some queueing tables. The quality of the approximation is tested by comparing it with known solutions in particular cases.

## 10. NotePatience is a Virtue in a Simple Model of Repetitively Joining a Queue
### Author(s):
- Colin E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
Each of n members of a finite customer population must weigh the rewards of service completion against the cost of waiting in a single exponential server queuing system. After completing service, a customer may re-enter the system. In attempting to maximize average return per unit time over an infinite horizon each customer must make a single decision, a choice of arrival rate which must then be used to determine the time until re-entry whenever the customer finishes being served.

## 11. NoteA Remark on Optimality of Control Limit Rules
### Author(s):
- Antonn Leanovsk
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1986
### Abstract:
A system with a single activated unit subject to Markovian deterioration is considered. It is shown by a numerical example that the optimality of control limit rules is not sufficient for the validity of two assertions of the paper by P. Kolesar (Kolesar, P. 1966. Minimum cost replacement under Markovian deterioration. Management Sci.12 (9, May) 694706.).
