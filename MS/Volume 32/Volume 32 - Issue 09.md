### Abstract:
Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (Payne, J. W., D. J. Laughhunn, R. Crum. 1984. An experimental study of multiattribute risky choice. Management Sci.30 13501361.) found that managers were multiattribute risk averse for gains, but multiattribute risk prone for losses, a pattern that is inconsistent with both the additive and the multiplicative multiattribute utility models. In this paper we develop the reference risk-value (RRV) model, which is simple in structure yet capable of representing the kinds of multiattribute reference effects observed by Payne et al. We also report the results of two experiments that compare the descriptive validity of the RRV model with that of the additive and multiplicative utility models. Experiment 1 involved choices between risky multiperiod cash flows; Experiment 2 choices between risky job alternatives described by change in salary and change in type of work. In Experiment 1, subjects were multiattribute risk averse for gains, but multiattribute risk neutral for losses. In Experiment 2, subjects were multiattribute risk averse for both gains and losses, but significantly more so for losses. Because both experiments produced significantly different multiattribute risk preferences for gains than losses, both favor the RRV model over the widely used additive and multiplicative models. However, because the patterns of multiattribute risk preferences for gains and losses were strikingly different in the two experiments, these results argue against any direct generalization of the reflection effect to a multiattribute context.

## 2. A Model for the Distribution of the Number of Bids on Federal Offshore Oil Leases
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Not all Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) federal oil leases receive the same number of bids. Indeed, while some leases receive over a dozen bids, many others receive no bids at all. This leads to uncertainty in the number of bids a lease will receiveuncertainty of potential concern to both bidders and bid takers.

## 3. A Multiplier Adjustment Method for the Generalized Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- Marshall L. Fisher

- Luk N. Van Wassenhove
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
We describe a branch and bound algorithm for the generalized assignment problem in which bounds are obtained from a Lagrangian relaxation with the multipliers set by a heuristic adjustment method. The algorithm was tested on a large sample of small random problems and a number of large problems derived from a vehicle routing application. Computation times were reasonable in all cases and the branch and bound trees generated had nearly two orders of magnitude fewer nodes than for competing algorithms. Although comparison of running times on different machines is difficult, the multiplier adjustment method appears to be about one order of magnitude faster than the best previously existing algorithms for this problem.

## 4. Optimal Residence Times for a Batch Biomass-to-Methane Conversion System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Biomass conversion processes have the potential for satisfying approximately 25% of the national demand for methane gas. At the present time, very little analytical work has been done to optimally design and operate the production facilities associated with these processes. This study was motivated by the high cost of these systems and the attendant need for efficient operation. While in storage, biomass decays (exponentially) over time, and gas production declines (exponentially) with time. The basic operational problem is to determine the optimal residence times for batches in the anaerobic digester to maximize total production over a fixed planning horizon. This paper provides analysis to characterize the form of the optimal policy and presents an efficient algorithm for obtaining the solution. An example problem, based upon realistic biomass and digester data, is used to illustrate the algorithm as well as the behavior of the optimal solution.

## 5. The Channel Intermediary Selection Decision: A Model and an Application
### Author(s):
- V. Kasturi Rangan

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Distribution channel design is a complex decision involving (a) the strategic choice of the appropriate channel structure, and (b) the tactical selection of the appropriate intermediaries. This paper presents a decision framework and a model to aid management in the tactical selection of the channel intermediaries and the target markets they should serve. The proposed model-based decision approach is illustrated with an actual industrial marketing application. The optimal intermediary network selected by the model is compared to an intuitive network recommended by sales management.

## 6. Value Functions for Infinite-Period Planning
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Cost-benefit and risk analysis studies that model tradeoffs between the present and the distant future by means of present value discounting have been criticized for according the future, and thus future generations, far too little importance. This paper presents an alternative means of modeling tradeoffs between different periods that accords the future far more importance than present value discounting, and that is no more difficult to apply. The paper also presents a means of modeling the preference issue of concern for equity or stability between different periods.

## 7. The Multiregion Dynamic Capacity Expansion Problem: An Improved Heuristic
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of determining a schedule of capacity expansions for m producing regions and a schedule of shipments from the regions to n markets so as to meet market demands over a T-period planning horizon at minimum discounted capacity expansion and shipment costs. The proposed algorithm permits capacity expansion costs to be arbitrary nonnegative increasing functions of the expansion amounts, but the shipment (and production) costs are restricted to be proportional to the amounts shipped. The algorithm does not require market demands to be increasing over time. The cost functions are allowed to be nonstationary and the possibility of imports is considered. The proposed heuristic algorithm improves on feasible solutions by simultaneously reassigning several capacity expansions to different regions and/or time periods. A look-ahead feature prevents the algorithm from becoming myopic and a self-learning feature dynamically updates computational parameters. The heuristic algorithm was tested on both randomly generated and real-life based problems with m  15, and n  15 and T  25. The test problems had increasing market demands, capacity expansion costs specified in the form of a concave power function or a fixed charge plus linear function, stationary costs (aside from a constant discount factor), and no imports. Results indicate that for the class of problems tested, the heuristic algorithm is computationally efficient and provides solutions that are closer to optimum than those obtained by previous algorithms.

## 8. Optimal Capacity Expansion Planning When There are Learning Effects
### Author(s):
- Randall S. Hiller
- Jeremy F. Shapiro
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Production and capacity expansion decisions are difficult to analyze when there is learning. Later production is less costly, and maybe more profitable, but the company must endure high initial production costs. Mixed integer programming models are presented for optimizing coordinated production and capacity expansion plans in the face of such learning effects. An illustrative model is developed, optimized, and the types of strategies it selects are discussed.

## 9. Incorporating Learning Curve Analysis into Medium-Term Capacity Planning Procedures: A Simulation Experiment
### Author(s):
- Timothy L. Smunt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to determine the type of company which can benefit from incorporating learning curve analysis into its medium-term capacity planning procedures and the effect of information aggregation on learning curve capacity projections. The research into these two issues uses a simulation study that describes the relevant production and information characteristics. Four production characteristic variables are investigated: (1) average learning rate, (2) run-time variance, (3) learning rate mix, and (4) run-time distribution. A fifth variable, level of data aggregation, is an information characteristic and is also investigated.

## 10. A Generalized Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Supplier's Profits
### Author(s):
- Hau L. Lee
- Meir J. Rosenblatt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
In this paper, the joint problem of ordering and offering price discount by a supplier to his sole/major buyer is analyzed. The objective is to induce the buyer to alter his order schedule and size so that the supplier can benefit from lower set up, ordering, and inventory holding costs. We generalize the quantity discount pricing model of Monahan (Monahan, J. P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits. Management Sci.30 (6) 720726.) to: (1) explicitly incorporate constraints imposed on the amount of discount that can be offered; and (2) relax the implicit assumption of a lot-for-lot (or order-for-order) policy adopted by the supplier. An algorithm is developed to solve the supplier's joint ordering and price discount problem.

## 11. Forecasting Error Evaluation in Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Production-Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
The impact of forecasted demand and forecast error, introduced in the Master Production Schedule, upon Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Systems is investigated. A computerized simulation was built to examine several questions. Results indicate that forecasting error, especially the mean error, does impact MRP system inventory costs and shortages; the greater the forecast error the greater the shortages. An exception to this general relationship was that a slight forecast BIAS may improve MRP system performance, which was the case for systems studied herein. Lot-sizing rules and product structure (bill of material structure) were also found to impact total MRP system inventory costs and shortages. The more complicated the MRP structure, the greater the differentiation among lot-sizing rules and the greater the cost impact of forecast errors. A good lot-sizing rule appears to be the period order quantity rule. However, as the forecast error level gets higher, it becomes difficult to select the better lot-sizing rule. Based on this study, suggestions are presented for the production manager's consideration, especially the inventory-production control manager.

## 12. Detection of Nonstationarity in Hydrologic Time Series
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1986
### Abstract:
Detection of changes in hydrologic time series due to intervention by man or natural causes is an important problem. Although intervention analysis has been used in the recent past to analyze nonstationary hydrologic time series, the necessity to specify a model of change and an initial time at which the time series has started to change are obvious disadvantages of intervention analysis. An alternative to intervention analysis is a method which is based on spectral characteristics and an exponential moving average model.
