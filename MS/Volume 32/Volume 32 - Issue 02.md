### Published:

### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a resource planning and allocation model for a mental-health community-support system. The intent of the model is to provide a tool to system managers and planners to support resource planning and allocation decision-making. More and more, mental health care is being delivered by a variety of community-based service agencies instead of single, comprehensive institutions. The service needs of a client population are continually changing, and depend upon the relative functioning of the population, which depends upon the efficacy of the services provided. The availability of resources is becoming scarcer, and is more closely scrutinized. Consequently, the system manager must attempt to apply the available resources as effectively as possible.

## 2. The Intellectual Development of Management Information Systems, 19721982: A Co-Citation Analysis
### Author(s):
- Mary J. Culnan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
Researchers in all academic disciplines benefit from an understanding of the intellectual development of their field. This understanding is essential for conducting studies which build systematically on prior research. The purpose of this study is to document the intellectual development of the ideas represented by published research in Management Information Systems (MIS) based on an author co-citation analysis. The resulting mapping is intended to serve as a benchmark for future assessments of MIS as a field as well as a means for documenting the emergence of new research specialties. The study sought to identify (1) the subfields which constitute MIS research, (2) the reference disciplines of these subfields, (3) the diffusion of the ideas represented by these subfields to other disciplines, and (4) which of these subfields represent active areas of current MIS research. Nine invisible colleges, or informal clusters of research were uncovered. These nine empirically defined conceptual groupings collectively define the intellectual foundations of MIS as well as the forces currently shaping MIS research. Four of the clusters represent early MIS research themes which are still popular, based on subsequent citation patterns. Despite the centrality of the concept of the organization to widely-accepted definitions of MIS, the results suggest that MIS research is not well-grounded in organization theory nor have MIS research results been widely diffused in the organizational literature. Suggestions for developing a better link between MIS and organizational theory are presented based on the concept of organizational effectiveness.

## 3. Patents and Innovation: An Empirical Study
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
To what extent would the rate of development and introduction of inventions decline in the absence of patent protection? To what extent do firms make use of the patent system, and what differences exist among firms and industries and over time in the propensity to patent? These questions are in need of much more study. This paper, which reports the results of an empirical investigation based on data obtained from a random sample of 100 U.S. manufacturing firms, provides new findings bearing on each of these questions.

## 4. When Does Lag Structure Really Matter in Optimizing Advertising Expenditures?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
A paper by Bultez and Naert in the May 1979 issue of Management Science tentatively concludes that profits are relatively insensitive to misspecification of the lag structure of advertising. We examine the conditions under which a firm's profits are most likely to be sensitive to the misspecification of the lag structure. Our analysis indicates how this sensitivity is related to (a) the form of the true lag structure, (b) the demand function, (c) the cost function, and (d) the firm's discount rate.

## 5. A Market Entry Timing Model for New Technologies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
A central issue in new product development and planning is the market timing/entry decision. An entry too early may risk pushing an under-developed product into the marketplace, with possible negative results; however, a product/technology may sacrifice sales if entry is delayed too long.

## 6. A Variable Buffer-Size Model and Its Use in Analyzing Closed Queueing Networks with Blocking
### Author(s):
- Rajan Suri
- Gregory W. Diehl
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
We present a model which enables efficient analysis of certain types of closed queueing networks with blocking due to limited buffer spaces. The networks analyzed are those in which the limited buffers occur in tandem subnetworks. A new model, with variable buffer-size, is introduced as a conceptual tool to model part of a tandem network with blocking, using only product-form submodels. Using this model we iteratively solve for the whole network. The technique is illustrated first for a simple system with tandem queues, and then for more complex systems. The method is compared with exact solutions or simulations, and found to be reasonably accurate. The method is easily implemented using standard software for closed queueing networks. Given the complexity of the blocking problem, our approach offers a simple and efficient alternative to exact analysis.

## 7. A Homogeneous Industry Model of Resource Allocation to Basic Research and Its Policy Implications
### Author(s):
- Prafulla Joglekar
- Morris Hamburg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
In a recent paper we showed that unaided industry allocation to basic (inappropriable) research is suboptimal and that in stimulating this allocation, provision of government seed money is generally counterproductive, while the provision of matching subsidies is not cost-efficient. Here we consider a special case of the model developed in the earlier paper (i.e., we now consider a homogeneous industry) and investigate the effects of several relevant factors upon an industrys allocation of resources to basic research. An extensive numerical example is presented that helps to verify and to interpret the model in realistic terms. Our findings question the validity of a number of popular beliefs about the need for government support of basic research in various types of industries. For example, contrary to popular belief, the greater the risk aversion displayed by member firms in an industry, the lesser may be the need for government support of its basic research. Also, the larger the number of firms in an industry the greater may be the need for government support of that industry's basic research.

## 9. NoteNaive Diversification and Portfolio RiskA Note
### Author(s):
- Ron Bird
- Mark Tippett
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
A number of authors have used the portfolio standard deviation to model the risk reduction advantages of naive diversification. Other authors have pointed out that when risk is modelled by the portfolio's variance the modelling process becomes much simpler and is computationally more efficient. In this note we derive an exact parametric relationship between portfolio standard deviation and size and thus highlight the dangers of using the standard deviation in conjunction with O.L.S. regression techniques to model the risk reduction advantages of naive diversification. It is then shown that past empirical studies which have used this methodology are deficient.

## 10. NoteComment on A Perturbation Scheme to Improve Hillier's Solution to the Facilities Layout Problem
### Author(s):
- Bharat K. Kaku
- Gerald L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
This note points out that three of the facilities layout problems solved by Picone and Wilhelm (Picone, C. J., W. E. Wilhelm. 1984. A perturbation scheme to improve Hillier's solution to the facilities layout problem. Management Sci.30 12381249.) are different from the test problems given in Nugent, Vollmann and Ruml (Nugent, C. E., T. E. Vollmann, J. Ruml. 1968. An experimental comparison of techniques for the assignment of facilities to locations. Oper. Res.16 150173.). Comparison with results obtained by other researchers to these test problems is, therefore, not valid.

## 11. NoteA Perturbation Scheme to Improve Hillier's Solution to the Facilities Layout Problem: A Clarification
### Author(s):
- Christopher J. Picone
- Wilbert E. Wilhelm
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1986
### Abstract:
Solutions to Nugent's plant location problems may be improved by using square plant shapes. These improved results were inadvertently reported by Picone and Wilhelm (Picone, C. J., W. E. Wilhelm. 1984. A perturbation scheme to improve Hillier's solution to the facilities layout problem. Management Sci.30 12381249.) as solutions to Nugent's problems, which involve rectangular plants. Hopefully, this clarification will stimulate research to define optimal relationships between plant shape and layout.
