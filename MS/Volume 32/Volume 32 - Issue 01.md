## 1. Research Opportunities in the Decision and Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- John D. C. Little
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
The National Science Foundation established the Decision and Management Sciences Program (DMS) in 1982. Healthy and growing, DMS is likely to affect OR/MS significantly, not only by providing funds for basic research, but also through its vision of a combined theoretical and empirical science of operational and managerial processes, and by its policy of bringing together different disciplines within the program. An NSF workshop held in Dallas in April 1984 sought to identify research opportunities in the decision and management sciences. Promising areas, many of them inviting cross-disciplinary research, appear in the development of measurement-based models for operational processes (both natural and designed and including organizational and managerial activities), choice theory (individual and group choice, values, judgment, and risk behavior), decision support, and the treatment of complexity. Increased knowledge in any of these areas would be likely to have a valuable long-run impact on management practice.

## 2. Optimal Strategic Petroleum Reserve Policies: A Steady State Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
A simple model is presented which allows us to determine the optimal size, fillup, and drawdown rates for a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) under a variety of supply and demand conditions. The optimal policy variables are determined by minimizing an analytic expression which we derive for the expected insecurity cost rate to the U.S. due to uncertainty in supply of imported oil.

## 3. A Comparative Application of Data Envelopment Analysis and Translog Methods: An Illustrative Study of Hospital Production
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
This paper compares inferences about hospital cost and production correspondences from two different estimation models: (1) the econometric modeling of the translog cost function, and (2) the application of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). While there are numerous examples of the application of each approach to empirical data, this paper provides insights into the relative strengths of the estimation methods by applying both models to the same data.

## 4. Subjective Probability and the Prisoner's Dilemma
### Author(s):
- John G. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
The paradox involved in sequences of Prisoner's Dilemma games is due to the fact that game theoretic definitions of optimality rarely coincide with any natural meaning of the word. Decision makers should incorporate their beliefs and experience into any mathematical analysis of the games. Once this has been done, via subjective probabilities, use of the cooperative move in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games can often be justified. The paper provides a simple algorithm for determining an optimal strategy, once the decision maker's subjective probabilities have been specified.

## 5. Lottery Equivalents: Reduction of the Certainty Effect Problem in Utility Assessment
### Author(s):
- Mark McCord
- Richard de Neufville
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
This note describes a simple procedure for assessing utility functions which avoids many difficulties of the standard techniques. The conventional methods suffer from at least three drawbacks; they (1) generate utility functions that depend on the probability levels used; (2) chain responses from one question to the next, so that any bias is propagated and even magnified; and (3) change ranges and reference points constantly, introducing range effects and other distortions. Noting the evidence linking the dependence of utility functions on the certainty effect, our method: (1) compares lotteries with other lotteries rather than certain amounts; (2) does not chain responses; and (3) consistently uses elementary lotteries which control for range and reference points. Experimental work supports the proposed procedure.

## 6. An Interactive Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Multiple Criteria Optimization
### Author(s):
- Odile Marcotte
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
We present a new interactive algorithm for multiple criteria optimization. The algorithm is of the branch-and-bound type, and differs from previous interactive algorithms in several ways. First, the field of application is wider because it applies to two important classes of multiple criteria decision problems: those for which the feasible set is convex and those for which the feasible set is discrete. Secondly, the algorithm does not require a great deal from the decision maker; he is merely required to indicate his preference between two vectors whenever the algorithm so demands.

## 7. The Dynamics of Plant Layout
### Author(s):
- Meir J. Rosenblatt
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
The problem of plant layout has generally been treated as a static one. In this paper, we deal with the dynamic nature of this problem. Both optimal and heuristic procedures are developed for this problem and are based on a dynamic programming formulation. The use of one of these approaches depends on the ability to solve the static problem efficiently. Finally, we briefly discuss the issue of extending the planning horizon, and how to resolve system nervousness when previously planned layouts need to be changed.

## 8. A Study of Organizational Effectiveness and its Predictors
### Author(s):
- Kim Cameron
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
Some authors have argued that research on organizational effectiveness should cease. This study demonstrates why organizational effectiveness studies are crucial in certain types of organizations, and it points out how many of the weaknesses and criticisms of past investigations can be addressed. The results of this study of 29 organizations indicate that certain managerial strategies are strongly associated with high static scores and with improving effectiveness over time. Managerial strategies, in fact, were found to be more important than structure, demographics, finances, and other factors. Proactive strategies and those with an external emphasis are more successful than internal and reactive strategies. Managerial strategies that are multifaceted are more likely to lead to effectiveness than monolithic strategies.

## 9. Optimal and Heuristic Procedures for Component Lot-Splitting in Multi-Stage Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- Jaya P. Moily
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
Component lot-splitting considerations, in which the lot-size of a component item may cover only a fraction of its parent item's lot-size, have been ignored in the literature when determining lot-sizes of items in multi-stage manufacturing systems. In this paper, a multi-stage lot-sizing problem is formulated under a specified component lot-splitting policy for the case of noninstantaneous production of items and constant demand for the end item. Optimal and heuristic solution procedures for the formulated problem are provided, including experimental results of comparison between these procedures. It is shown that considerable cost savings can result if the component lot-splitting approach is employed under favorable conditions in multi-stage manufacturing environments. In addition, reduced inventory levels are achieved which translate into lower working capital requirements and a less cluttered shop floor. The heuristic procedure is recommended as an acceptable alternative to the optimal procedure if the number of items in the multi-stage system is large or if inventory carrying and setup/order costs cannot be accurately estimated. Further, component lot-splitting considerations may be ignored if production rates of facilities in the system are in balance. Finally, a methodology for application of the component lot-splitting policy where the end item demand is time-varying is discussed.

## 10. Piecewise Loglinear Estimation of Efficient Production Surfaces
### Author(s):
- Rajiv D. Banker
- Ajay Maindiratta
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1986
### Abstract:
Linear programming formulations for piecewise loglinear estimation of efficient production surfaces are derived from a set of basic properties postulated for the underlying production possibility sets. Unlike the piecewise linear model of Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (Banker R. D., A. Charnes, W. W. Cooper. 1984. Models for the estimation of technical and scale inefficiencies in data envelopment analysis. Management Sci.30 (September) 10781092.), this approach permits the identification of increasing marginal products, and estimation of the classical S-shaped production functions. Methods are also provided for estimating technical inefficiencies and other production characteristics, such as rates of substitution and transformation, marginal products, returns to scale and most productive scale sizes on the basis of observed production data. The results of a simulation study are reported to illustrate the usefulness of this estimation method in empirical applications when there are a priori reasons to expect increasing marginal products in some regions of the production function. A modified model is provided to extend this analysis to the situation of non-competing outputs addressed by the bi-extremal model of Banker, Charnes, Cooper, and Schinnar (Banker R. D., A. Charnes, W. W. Cooper, A. Schinnar. 1981. A bi-extremal principle for frontier estimation and efficiency evaluation. Management Sci.27 (December) 13701382.).
