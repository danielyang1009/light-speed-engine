## 2. Determining Organizational Effectiveness: Another Look, and an Agenda for Research

### Abstract:
Concern with the effectiveness, productivity, efficiency or excellence of organizations is a subject that has motivated the writings of economists, organization theorists, management philosophers, financial analysts, management scientists, consultants, and practitioners. It has served as a unifying theme for over a century of research on the management and design of organizations, yet the empirical research has not contributed to the development of a universal theory of organizational effectiveness. In this paper we review the extent to which the components of a contingent behavioral theory of organizational effectiveness already exist, one that incorporates the paradoxes and tradeoffs inherent in real life organizations. We consider the problem of effectiveness measurement, and we propose a research approach utilizing a strategy of engineering organizational effectiveness which could lead to an inductive, applied, empirically-based theory of contingent organization design. In this context the engineering of organizational effectiveness has a dual purpose. For the organizations and their managers participating in the research, it refers to understanding, constructing and managing organizational activities in given contexts so as to achieve and maintain improved performance as measured by one or more situationally-determined criteria. In addition, to provide the empirical basis from which induction can proceed, the engineered events must be structured and implemented in such a way so as to facilitate theory construction and testing.

## 3. Effectiveness as Paradox: Consensus and Conflict in Conceptions of Organizational Effectiveness
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Attention to the subject of organizational effectiveness has been increasing in the last several years as popular management books have extolled management excellence, almost two million jobs have been lost due to poor U.S. competitiveness, and economic conditions have put pressure on organizations to become more accountable with their resources. However, despite its popularity, much confusion continues in the organizational literature regarding the definition, circumscription, and appropriate criteria for assessing effectiveness. In this paper, I summarize what areas are becoming consensual among most writers on effectiveness, and I point out continuing areas of disagreement and conflict. The five statements summarizing consensual characteristics of effectiveness and the three statements summarizing areas of continuing conflict point out that agreement about effectiveness is mainly an agreement to disagree. Conflicts center mainly on the incompatibility and inappropriateness of commonly selected criteria. The main theme of the paper, however, is a discussion of an inherent, but largely ignored, characteristic of effectiveness in organizationsthe paradoxical nature of effectiveness criteria. This discussion illustrates that the most effective organizations are also those characterized by paradoxesi.e., contradictions, simultaneous opposites, and incompatibilities. Taking account of this characteristic helps explain one reason why so much confusion and disagreement continues to surround effectiveness, and it uncovers a new set of research questions that can guide future investigations. Some suggestions are provided for how research on paradoxes in effectiveness might be pursued in the future.

## 4. Organizational Information Requirements, Media Richness and Structural Design
### Author(s):
- Richard L. Daft
- Robert H. Lengel
### Published:
- 1 May 1986
### Abstract:
This paper answers the question, Why do organizations process information? Uncertainty and equivocality are defined as two forces that influence information processing in organizations. Organization structure and internal systems determine both the amount and richness of information provided to managers. Models are proposed that show how organizations can be designed to meet the information needs of technology, interdepartmental relations, and the environment. One implication for managers is that a major problem is lack of clarity, not lack of data. The models indicate how organizations can be designed to provide information mechanisms to both reduce uncertainty and resolve equivocality.

## 5. The Decision-Making Paradigm of Organizational Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1986
### Abstract:
This paper introduces and explicates the decision-making paradigm of organizational design. We argue that the domains of existing design paradigms are declining in scope, and that the nature of current and future organizational environments requires use of a design paradigm that responds to the increasing frequency and criticality of the decision-making process. In particular, we argue that the decision-making paradigm is applicable when the organizational environments are hostile, complex, and turbulent.

## 6. Central Problems in the Management of Innovation
### Author(s):
- Andrew H. Van de Ven
### Published:
- 1 May 1986
### Abstract:
Innovation is defined as the development and implementation of new ideas by people who over time engage in transactions with others within an institutional order. This definition focuses on four basic factors (new ideas, people, transactions, and institutional context). An understanding of how these factors are related leads to four basic problems confronting most general managers: (1) a human problem of managing attention, (2) a process problem in managing new ideas into good currency, (3) a structural problem of managing part-whole relationships, and (4) a strategic problem of institutional leadership. This paper discusses these four basic problems and concludes by suggesting how they fit together into an overall framework to guide longitudinal study of the management of innovation.

## 7. Inertia, Environments, and Strategic Choice: A Quasi-Experimental Design for Comparative-Longitudinal Research
### Author(s):
- Elaine Romanelli
- Michael L. Tushman
### Published:
- 1 May 1986
### Abstract:
This paper develops a research design for examining the relative influence of managers and environments on organizational activity over time. We outline three basic models of organization evolution: (1) an inertial model, which emphasizes constraints on evolution imposed by early patterns of exchange; (2) an external control model, which posits change in organizational activities that is guided by changes in environmental conditions over time; and (3) a strategic management model, which emphasizes the role of senior executives in choosing patterns and domains of competitive activity.

## 8. Virtual Positions and Power
### Author(s):
- Kenneth D. Mackenzie
### Published:
- 1 May 1986
### Abstract:
This paper discusses a class of natural organizational phenomena called virtual positions and links them to the enactment of power. Virtual positions involve three or more persons from different parts of an organization working together on a recurring (and usually major) task process. A virtual position is contrasted to a regular position in which an incumbent performs a set of task processes. There is no regular position for the task processes performed by a virtual position. Instead the set of individuals act as if they are a composite position. There are two types of virtual positions: regulated and unregulated. Regulated virtual positions usually take the form of committees, standing committees, and task forces. Unregulated virtual positions involve task processes which have been neither rationalized nor integrated with the Organizational Architecture.
