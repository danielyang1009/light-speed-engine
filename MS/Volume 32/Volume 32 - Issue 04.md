## 1. The Use of Screening in Policy Analysis
### Author(s):
- Warren E. Walker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
In most policy analysis studies there are a large number of alternative policies and a large number of impacts to be considered. Time and budget constraints make it impossible to calculate all the impacts for all of the alternatives. As a result, such studies include some process for reducing the number of alternatives to be examined in detail. The process is often implicit and nonscientific (e.g., only the decisionmaker's three favorite alternatives are considered).

## 2. Safety Stocks in MRPSystems with Emergency Setups for Components
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
Material Requirements Planning or Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) systems originally were designed for a deterministic environment. Often, however, demand for finished products is uncertain and some type of buffering mechanism is necessary to provide desired levels of service. When the schedule is replanned each period, as typically is done, variability of demand may manifest itself in the form of early or emergency production runs. Safety stock may serve to avert some or most of these emergency production runs. We have developed a heuristic algorithm which is shown to provide extremely good guidelines for setting safety stock levels.

## 3. A Comparison of Strategies to Dampen Nervousness in MRP Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
This research examines the effectiveness of alternative strategies for dealing with the problem of order instability, or nervousness, which occurs in Material Requirements Planning systems. Nervousness can be particularly disruptive in multi-level production processes where a change in order size or timing at one level can result in changes at other levels.

## 4. A Comparative Evaluation of Heuristic Line Balancing Techniques
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
In this paper, we report on a computational experiment designed to assess the efficacy of 26 heuristic decision rules which group work tasks into work stations along an assembly line such that the number of work stations required is minimized. The heuristic decision rules investigated vary from simple list processing procedures that consider a single attribute of each work task for assignment, to procedures which are optimal seeking, but which have had their search terminated through the imposition of a limit on the amount of computation time that can be devoted to each search. Also included are heuristic decision rules which backtrack in an attempt to locate an improved solution, and decision rules which probabilistically search for improved solutions. Our investigation differs from those reported previously, in that the objective in balancing each line is to determine the minimum number of work stations for a given limit on the time available for assembly at each work station (the cycle time). Previous approaches have investigated the problem of determining the minimum cycle time for a given line length. We also compare the results obtained with the optimal solution for a subset of the problems investigated. Both problems which have appeared in the open literature and problems which have been solved for the first time are included. Because a portion of our results differ from those reported previously, we suggest why these differences have occurred. Guidelines are also given to those balancing industrial assembly lines on the choice of the heuristic decision rule to use whether one is attempting to obtain a minimum station balance given a limit on the time available for assembly at each work station, or whether one is attempting to minimize the time devoted to assembly at a work station given a limit on the number of work stations available.

## 5. A Cost-Based Methodology for Stochastic Line Balancing with Intermittent Line Stoppages
### Author(s):
- Fred N. Silverman
- John C. Carter
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
This paper examines the effect of stochastic task times on the total operating costs of a continuously paced assembly line under the assumption that the line is stopped whenever at least one work station requires more time than allotted. A comprehensive stochastic cost function is integrated into an efficient balancing algorithm to enable an approximately minimum cost balance to be obtained. An experiment was conducted to determine the cost savings resulting from using the stochastic method as compared to two deterministic methods. The stochastic method of this paper produced lower cost balances in most cases studied.

## 6. Scheduling with Multiple Performance Measures: The One-Machine Case
### Author(s):
- Rosser T. Nelson

- Richard L. Daniels
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
Most scheduling research has considered optimizing a single performance measure (criterion). In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling jobs on a single machine when the desirability of a schedule is evaluated using more than one performance measure. The procedures developed here can be used to construct trade-off curves among selected performance measures. The importance of the trade-off curve is that it provides the complete set of possibly optimal solutions for any objective function (cost function) involving only the selected performance measures. With this information, a manager can concentrate on selecting the most preferred schedule from the set.

## 7. The Ability of Nash's Theory of Cooperative Games to Predict the Outcomes of Buyer-Seller Negotiations: A Dyad-Level Test
### Author(s):
- Scott A. Neslin
- Leonard Greenhalgh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
This research develops and implements a dyad-level procedure for testing whether the outcomes of buyer-seller negotiations correspond to settlements prescribed by Nash's theory of cooperative games. The procedure entails a multivariate statistical test in which some parameters are estimated by simulation, while others are provided directly from the assessment of negotiator utility functions by means of conjoint analysis. The procedure is applied to an experiment in which subjects participated in a realistic role-playing exercise that replicated the purchase of television advertising time. Results indicate that at the 0.01 significance level, 57.8% of the dyads can be rejected as not having achieved Nash solutions. These results, and their implications for marketing practitioners as well as future research, are discussed.

## 8. Forecasting Data Published at Irregular Time Intervals Using an Extension of Holt's Method
### Author(s):
- David J. Wright
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1986
### Abstract:
In practice many data series contain observations at irregular times whereas most forecasting methods are restricted to the case of equal time intervals between data points. This paper provides extensions of Single Exponential Smoothing and Holt's Method to the case of irregularly spaced data and shows them to be highly efficient computationally. The new methods are applied to six published series, and their performance is analyzed via four error measures with respect to changes in the smoothing parameters.
