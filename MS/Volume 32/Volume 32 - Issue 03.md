## 1. Forecasting When Pattern Changes Occur Beyond the Historical Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
Forecasting methods currently available assume that established patterns or relationships will not change during the post-sample forecasting phase. This, however, is not a realistic assumption for business and economic series. This paper describes a new approach to forecasting which takes into account possible pattern changes beyond the historical data. This approach is based on the development of two models: one short, the other long term. These models are then reconciled to produce the final forecasts by setting certain parameters as a function of the number, extent, and duration of pattern changes that have occurred in the past. The proposed method has been applied to the 111 series used in the M-Competition. Post-sample forecasting accuracy comparisons show the superiority of the proposed approach over the most accurate methods in the M-Competition.

## 2. Optimal Timing of Account Audits in Internal Control
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Morey
- David A. Dittman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
This paper calculates the minimum required frequency between audits of a given type to meet prespecified accuracy goals for a given type of account. Both 100 percent, as well as sampling type audits are addressed. The effectiveness of a given audit type includes the mean and standard deviation of any residual error that may remain in the account after the audit has been performed and after account balances have been adjusted. The accuracy goals consist of the maximum accumulated error that is considered by management to be tolerable between audits, and the prescribed likelihood that this tolerance level will not be exceeded. The model assumes that certain parameters of the error process have been estimated, but no distributional information is required. Closed form, easy to use, lot-size type formulae are derived which calculate the required frequency (or upper bounds) between audits. The model also provides insights as to the relative cost-effectiveness of various types of audits.

## 3. A Parametric Approach to Stochastic Dominance: The Lognormal Case
### Author(s):
- Yoram Kroll
- Haim Levy
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
Mixing the risky asset with the riskless asset. Levy and Kroll have developed stochastic dominance rules with borrowing and lending (SDR). These rules can be easily applied to discrete distributions (e.g., ex-post data). However, an infinite number of comparisons is involved when the distributions under consideration are continuous. This study suggests a method for applying the SDR criteria to continuous distributions where, in general, a small number of comparisons is involved. For some distributions (e.g., lognormal) the SDR relationship is stated in terms of the distributions' parameters, and hence only one comparison is required. These SDR relationships enable us to establish the lognormal efficient frontier.

## 4. Using Order Statistics to Estimate Real Estate Bid Distributions
### Author(s):
- Keith C. Brown
- Deborah J. Brown
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
In order to determine an optimum sales strategy for a property it is useful to estimate the distribution of bids which will be received for the property. The more accurate the estimate of the distribution, the higher the expected return will be from following the optimal strategy. This paper presents a technique for estimating the parameters of that distribution based on order statistics. It also describes how a posted list price might affect the sale price data used in this estimation technique, and how the technique can be modified to deal with this type of censored data.

## 5. Expert Resolution
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
This paper discusses some current issues in the combination of probabilities and serves as an introduction to a series of four papers and a rejoinder relating to a paper by Morris (Morris, P. A. 1983. An axiomatic approach to expert resolution. Management Sci.29 2432.) on an axiomatic approach to expert resolution. The axiomatic approach and the modeling approach to expert resolution are discussed, and some comments on practical issues are given.

## 6. Another Look at an Axiomatic Approach to Expert Resolution
### Author(s):
- Dennis V. Lindley
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
Morris proposed a set of axioms for combining experts probability assessments. It is here argued that one of these axioms is unsatisfactory. Its use leads to a conflict between the discrete and continuous cases which disappears in a coherent approach.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Morris (Morris, P. A. 1983. An axiomatic approach to expert resolution. Management Sci.29 2432.) develops an axiom system for combining expert judgments by means of a processing rule. It is shown that the axioms are self-contradictory.

## 8. Calibration and the Aggregation of Probabilities
### Author(s):
- Robert T. Clemen
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
In order to avoid the task of assessing a complicated likelihood function, Morris uses an axiomatic approach to develop a multiplicative rule for aggregating a decision maker's and an expert's probabilities. An essential shortcoming of the multiplicative rule is that it does not allow the decision maker to model his beliefs about the dependence between his assessment and the expert's. The root of the problem lies in the fact that the decision maker must calibrate the expert's information. When the calibration is done properly, the decision maker is forced to tackle the task which Morris proposes to avoid.

## 9. Calibration and the Expert Problem
### Author(s):
- S. French
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
A decision maker needs to give his subjective probability for a single event of interest, A. Being aware that he has little substantive knowledge of the factors affecting A, the decision maker asks an expert for advice. The expert gives his subjective probability for A. In the light of this information, how should the decision maker form his subjective probability? In particular, does it matter to the decision maker whether the expert is a well-calibrated probability assessor? In this paper these questions are explored and it is suggested that concepts such as calibration and refinement cannot usefully be defined independently of the decision maker.

## 11. Delays for Customers from Different Arrival Streams to a Queue
### Author(s):
- Susan L. Albin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
In a queue with several different arrival streams, in general, the expected delay for customers from one stream is not equal to the expected delay for customers from the other streams. Two approximations are presented here for the expected delay for customers from a particular arrival stream in an arrival process that is the superposition of independent renewal processes. Both approximations yield errors less than 10 percent, on average, when compared to simulation estimates. One approximation, extended from Holtzman (Holtzman, J. M. 1982. Mean delays of individual streams into a queue: the GIi/M/1 queue. Applied Probability-Computer Science: The Interface, I, Proc. Conf. in Boca Raton, 417430.), yields better results for very sparse arrival streams and the other, empirically derived, is easier to calculate. These approximations are useful in comparing the expected delays for customers from different arrival processes to a single queue and for customers with different routes through a network of queues.

## 12. Preemptive Scheduling of Uniform Machines by Ordinary Network Flow Techniques
### Author(s):
- A. Federgruen
- H. Groenevelt
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of scheduling n jobs, each with a specific processing requirement, release time and due date on m uniform parallel machines. It is shown that a feasible schedule can be obtained by determining the maximum flow in a network, thus permitting the use of standard network flow codes. Using a specialized maximum flow procedure, the complexity reduces to O(tn3) operations when t is the number of distinct machine types. Previous algorithms solve the feasibility problem in O((m + log n)(m2n3 + n4)) operations. In addition to the feasibility problem, we describe algorithms for the maximum lateness criterion. Here we develop a bound which compares even more favorably to the best previous bound. We also show how other criteria with respect to the amount of work completed on each job prior to its due date or the amount of work scheduled in each of a sequence of periods can be optimized by similar path augmenting techniques.

## 13. The Multi-Item Capacitated Lot Size Problem: Error Bounds of Manne's Formulations
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Hirofumi Matsuo
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
We discuss an approximation scheme for the multi-item lot size problem. It is based on an optimal basic solution of a linear programming problem derived from the original problem. The approximate solution is obtained by taking a linear convex combination of the optimal solution of the linear programming problem. We express error bounds of the approximation as a function of some parameters that can be easily estimated in practice. When set-up times are positive, the approximation may result in an infeasible solution. We take the same approach to show that the infeasibility of the approximation is small. The analysis is extended to a variable capacity problem with overtime. As an auxiliary result, we provide a bound on the duality gap of the Lagrangian dual problem.

## 14. Extending Planning Languages to Include Optimization Capabilities
### Author(s):

- J. Lordeman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
Planning languages and spreadsheet systems are very popular, and the number of new users is increasing dramatically. On larger computers, IFPS, System W, and FCS-EPS are among the most widely used systems; while on personal computers, Multiplan and 1-2-3 enjoy great popularity. Currently, such languages operate mainly as simulators, evaluating specific cases. In this paper, we propose methodology which is useful in designing an optimization capability for these languages. This capability permits the user to designate certain model variables as decisions, constraints, and the objective. Upper and lower limits on the decisions and constraints are also specified. The optimization interface then diagnoses the problem as linear or nonlinear, computes first partial derivatives needed by the solution algorithms, and invokes the appropriate solver. Information regarding the optimal solution is obtained using the reporting and graphics capabilities of the planning language. Sensitivity analysis and what if features permit easy modification of the problem for further analysis.

## 15. Analysis and Generalisation of a Multivariate Exponential Smoothing Model
### Author(s):
- A. C. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1986
### Abstract:
The multivariate exponential smoothing model of Enns, Machak, Spivey and Wrobleski is examined and it is found that its structure is such that it can be estimated by using techniques designed for a univariate exponential smoothing model. Similarly forecasts can be made using algorithms for the univariate model. The model can therefore be handled very easily. A more general univariate time series model, which can include polynomial trends and seasonal factors, is then set up and a multivariate generalisation, analogous to the multivariate exponential smoothing model, is introduced. It is shown that this model can also be handled using algorithms designed for the univariate case.
