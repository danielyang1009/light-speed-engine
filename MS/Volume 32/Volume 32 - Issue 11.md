### Abstract:
This paper describes a study of Navy recruiter productivity at the individual recruiter level. Timeseries of monthly contract production by each of 345 recruiters who served for six months or more during the period May 1977December 1978 formed the basis of the study. A wide variation in job tenure was observed in this data with some recruiters beginning their normal three-year tour of duty, and others in their second or third years. Two key empirical findings are reported here:

## 2. Chief Executive Personality and Corporate Strategy and Structure in Small Firms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
An empirical investigation of 97 firms was conducted to determine the relationships that three aspects of the chief executive's (CEO's) personality have with the strategies, structures, decision making methods and performance of their firms. CEO flexibility was associated with niche strategies, simple, informal structures, and intuitive, risk-embracing decision making. CEO need for achievement was related to broadly focussed, marketing-oriented strategies, formal and sophisticated structures, and proactive, analytical decision making. Executives with an internal locus of control pursued more product innovation, were more future oriented, and tailored their approaches to the circumstances facing their firms. The relationships between personality and organizational characteristics were found to be by far the strongest in small firms and also somewhat more significant in dynamic environments. Flexibility and locus of control related to corporate performance under certain conditions; need for achievement did not.

## 3. The Effects of the Sample Size, the Investment Horizon and Market Conditions on the Validity of Composite Performance Measures: A Generalization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
In our previous study, the empirical relationship between Sharpe measure and its risk proxy was shown to be dependent on the sample size, the investment horizon and market conditions. This important result is generalized in the present study to include Treynor and Jensen performance measures. Moreover, it is shown that the conventional sample estimate of ex-ante Treynor measure is biased. As a result, the ranking of mutual fund performance based on the biased estimate is not an unbiased ranking as implied by the ex-ante Treynor measure. In addition, a significant relationship between the estimated Jensen measure and its risk proxy may produce a potential bias associated with the cumulative average residual technique which is frequently used for testing the market efficiency hypothesis. Finally, the impact of the dependence between risk and average return in Friend and Blume's findings is also investigated.

## 4. The Adoption of Radical and Incremental Innovations: An Empirical Analysis
### Author(s):

- Jane E. Dutton
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
This paper proposes and empirically tests whether different models are needed to predict the adoption of technical process innovations that contain a high degree of new knowledge (radical innovations) and a low degree of new knowledge (incremental innovations). Results from a sample of 40 footwear manufacturers suggest that extensive knowledge depth (measured by the number of technical specialists) is important for the adoption of both innovation types. Larger firms are likely to have both more technical specialists and to adopt radical innovations. The study did not find associations between the adoption of either innovation type and decentralized decision making, managerial attitudes toward change, and exposure to external information. By implication, managers trying to encourage technical process innovation adoption need not be as concerned about modifying centralization of decision making, managerial attitudes and exposure to external information as would managers trying to encourage other types of innovation adoption, e.g., innovations in social services where these factors have been found to be important. Instead, investment in human capital in the form of technical specialists appears to be a major facilitator of technical process innovation adoption.

## 5. Concepts and Applications of Backup Coverage
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
Backup coverage, the second coverage of a demand node, is suggested as a decision criterion in modelling the location of emergency services on a network. The efficient handling of stochastic demand by vehicles which can respond to only one call at a time may require backup coverage in areas of high demand as a means to maintain a more uniform level of service. This new criterion is applied in the context of the classic covering models, the Location Set Covering Problem and the Maximal Covering Location Problem. First coverage as defined in these models is traded off against backup coverage in the present work. Other efforts which incorporate additional levels of coverage are reviewed. We also show how to extend these models to third as well as subsequent coverage. Based on an example problem we show that significant levels of backup coverage may possibly be provided within a system without substantial loss of first coverage.

## 6. Expected Utility, Penalty Functions, and Duality in Stochastic Nonlinear Programming
### Author(s):
- Aharon Ben-Tal
- Marc Teboulle
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
We consider nonlinear programming problem (P) with stochastic constraints. The Lagrangean corresponding to such problems has a stochastic part, which in this work is replaced by its certainty equivalent (in the sense of expected utility theory). It is shown that the deterministic surrogate problem (CE-P) thus obtained, contains a penalty function which penalizes violation of the constraints in the mean. The approach is related to several known methods in stochastic programming such as: chance constraints, stochastic goal programming, reliability programming and mean-variance analysis. The dual problem of (CE-P) is studied (for problems with stochastic righthand sides in the constraints) and a comprehensive duality theory is developed by introducing a new certainty equivalent (NCE) concept. Motivation for the NCE and its potential role in Decision Theory are discussed, as well as mean-variance approximations.

## 7. Sequencing Capacity Expansion Projects in Continuous Time
### Author(s):
- A. W. Neebe
- M. R. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
We consider a problem of sequencing capacity expansion projects with a continuous demand function specified over a given time horizon. Each type of expansion project has a specified integer capacity and an associated cost which is nonincreasing with respect to the time at which the project is brought on stream. The problem is to determine the sequence of expansions to provide sufficient capacity to meet demand at minimum cost. A formulation is presented and its relaxation leads to a shortest route problem. The sequencing problem is solved using a branch and bound procedure with Lagrangean relaxation providing bounds. A particularly effective heuristic is also developed. Computational results are given.

## 8. Decision Rules and Transactions, Organizations and Markets
### Author(s):
- Helmy H. Baligh
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
Organizations and markets are defined as sets of people who are connected together by the logical orders of decision rule and transaction respectively. Super organizations are defined as sets of organizations connected by decision rules. The logical order is the basis of an arrangement of people or organizations. These concepts are developed in an unambiguous manner, and used to produce analytically useful definitions of pure and hybrid classes. The concepts are shown to be of value in the analysis of organizations and markets. The concept of the decision rule is used to define static organization structures, and to define dynamic task processes in them. Generalizations about organizations and markets are developed and put together to get new ones. Two classification schemes in the literature are simplified by a redefinition of their classes in terms of decision rules only. This not only integrates two seemingly different schemes, but it illustrates how useful the concept of the decision rule could be in analyzing and generalizing about organizations, other arrangements of persons, and arrangements of arrangements of persons.

## 9. Reducing Social Context Cues: Electronic Mail in Organizational Communication
### Author(s):
- Lee Sproull
- Sara Kiesler
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
This paper examines electronic mail in organizational communication. Based on ideas about how social context cues within a communication setting affect information exchange, it argues that electronic mail does not simply speed up the exchange of information but leads to the exchange of new information as well. In a field study in a Fortune 500 company, we used questionnaire data and actual messages to examine electronic mail communication at all levels of the organization. Based on hypotheses from research on social communication, we explored effects of electronic communication related to self-absorption, status equalization, and uninhibited behavior. Consistent with experimental studies, we found that decreasing social context cues has substantial deregulating effects on communication. And we found that much of the information conveyed through electronic mail was information that would not have been conveyed through another medium.

## 10. NoteOn A Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Vendor Profits
### Author(s):
- Avijit Banerjee
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1986
### Abstract:
Monahan (Monahan, James P. 1984. A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits. Management Sci.30 (June) 720726.) develops a model for establishing an optimal quantity discount schedule from a vendor's viewpoint. In this note we show that this model is limited to the case where the vendor buys from another supplier. Incorporating vendor's inventory carrying costs, we develop a generalized version of Monahan's model and demonstrate its equivalence with the joint economic lot size approach suggested by Banerjee (Banerjee, Avijit. 1986. A joint economic lot size model for purchaser and vendor. Decision Sci.17 (Summer) 292311.).
