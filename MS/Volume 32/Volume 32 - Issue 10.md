### Abstract:
Business Portfolio Planning techniques often suggest that firms should invest in industries with high profitability, high growth, or other attractive characteristics. Critiquing this view, we suggest that the same factors which lead to high profitability in an industry may cause its inefficient participants to earn lower profits. Higher growth, on the other hand, may benefit inefficient firms while reducing the gains of efficient competitors. The paper offers theory and evidence to support this view of performance dependencies for the special case of diversified firms.

## 2. Strategic Factor Markets: Expectations, Luck, and Business Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Much of the current thinking about competitive strategy focuses on ways that firms can create imperfectly competitive product markets in order to obtain greater than normal economic performance. However, the economic performance of firms does not depend simply on whether or not its strategies create such markets, but also on the cost of implementing those strategies. Clearly, if the cost of strategy implementation is greater than returns obtained from creating an imperfectly competitive product market, then firms will not obtain above normal economic performance from their strategizing efforts. To help analyze the cost of implementing strategies, we introduce the concept of a strategic factor market, i.e., a market where the resources necessary to implement a strategy are acquired. If strategic factor markets are perfect, then the cost of acquiring strategic resources will approximately equal the economic value of those resources once they are used to implement product market strategies. Even if such strategies create imperfectly competitive product markets, they will not generate above normal economic performance for a firm, for their full value would have been anticipated when the resources necessary for implementation were acquired. However, strategic factor markets will be imperfectly competitive when different firms have different expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. In these settings, firms may obtain above normal economic performance from acquiring strategic resources and implementing strategies. We show that other apparent strategic factor market imperfections, including when a firm already controls all the resources needed to implement a strategy, when a firm controls unique resources, when only a small number of firms attempt to implement a strategy, and when some firms have access to lower cost capital than others, and so on, are all special cases of differences in expectations held by firms about the future value of a strategic resource. Firms can attempt to develop better expectations about the future value of strategic resources by analyzing their competitive environments or by analyzing skills and capabilities they already control. Environmental analysis cannot be expected to improve the expectations of some firms better than others, and thus cannot be a source of more accurate expectations about the future value of a strategic resource. However, analyzing a firms skills and capabilities can be a source of more accurate expectations. Thus, from the point of view of firms seeking greater than normal economic performance, our analysis suggests that strategic choices should flow mainly from the analysis of its unique skills and capabilities, rather than from the analysis of its competitive environment.

## 3. Emergency Government Interventions: Case Study of Natural Gas Shortages
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
We present a framework, decision models, and supporting methods to improve government's decisions on a class of intervention problems. The example used is on natural gas shortages. We provide three decision models that move progressively from regulated market mechanisms as a means of gas allocation to nonprice-based directives as shortages become more serious. A critical aspect of this framework is government's timing in switching decision models and changing levels of decision variables. We provide new results on chance constraints that enable time series forecasting as the basis for triggering intervention decisions. In particular, we show that the forecasted regression quantile function for the underlying stochastic process of a chance constraint is the deterministic equivalent for the constraint. Lastly, we evaluate some government decisions on the 1976/77 natural gas shortage in Ohio by applying our methods in a simulation of the conditions of that time. One finding is that some of the emergency actions taken were probably unnecessary.

## 4. An Analysis of Risk and Return in the Defense Market: Its Impact on Weapon System Competition
### Author(s):
- Willis R. Greer, Jr.
- Shu S. Liao
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
With growing austerity pressures from the Administration, Congress, and the general public, the Government's procurement policy has called for increased use of dual-source competition as a means of reducing acquisition costs. In practice, however, this policy has produced mixed results. The cause seems to be an inadequate understanding of the peculiarities of competition in the Government's market. This paper examines the risk and return available in the defense market, and relates it to the industry's propensity to compete. The results show that intelligent observation of the industry's capacity utilization rate would contribute to the development of a more efficient acquisition policy.

## 5. A Tight Linearization and an Algorithm for Zero-One Quadratic Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Warren P. Adams
- Hanif D. Sherali
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the solution of linearly constrained zero-one quadratic programming problems. Problems of this kind arise in numerous economic, location decision, and strategic planning situations, including capital budgeting, facility location, quadratic assignment, media selection, and dynamic set covering. A new linearization technique is presented for this problem which is demonstrated to yield a tighter continuous or linear programming relaxation than is available through other methods. An implicit enumeration algorithm which uses Lagrangian relaxation, Benders' cutting planes, and local explorations is designed to exploit the strength of this linearization. Computational experience is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed linearization and algorithm.

## 6. A Comparison of Heuristics for Scheduling Projects with Cash Flows and Resource Restrictions
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Russell
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
The problem addressed in this paper is the scheduling of activities in a project to maximize net present value given cash inflows, outflows, and resource restrictions. Although optimization procedures exist for small problems of this type, they generally cannot solve large-scale problems and may not be widely available. Six heuristic scheduling rules are compared on 80 test problems. The test problems include large-scale engineering construction projects as well as 50 resource constrained problems from the literature.

## 7. Quality Improvement and Learning in Productive Systems
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Fine
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
Recent interest in product quality suggests that effort devoted to improving the quality of manufactured products may reduce unit costs. This conjecturethat improving quality can lower costschallenges the traditional assumption that unit costs increase with increased quality assurance activities and has significant implications for quality management.

## 8. A Branch and Bound Approach for Machine Load Balancing in Flexible Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- Mohammed Berrada
- Kathryn E. Stecke
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is an integrated system of computer numerically controlled machine tools connected with automated material handling. A set of production planning problems for FMSs has been defined (Stecke [Stecke, Kathryn E. 1983. Formulation and solution of nonlinear integer production planning problems for flexible manufacturing systems. Management Sci.29 (3, March) 273288.]), and this paper considers one called the loading problem. This problem involves assigning to the machine tools, operations and associated cutting tools required for part types that have been selected to be produced simultaneously. The part types will be machined during the upcoming production period (say, of one to three weeks duration on average) and according to a prespecified part mix. This assignment is constrained by the capacity of each machine's tool magazine as well as by the production capacities of both the system, and each machine type. There are several loading objectives that are applicable in a flexible manufacturing situation. This paper considers the most commonly applied one, that of balancing the workload on all machines.

## 9. A Single Product Cycling Problem Under Brownian Motion Demand
### Author(s):
- R. G. Vickson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
This paper treats a continuous review, single product stochastic cycling problem with demand modelled as a Brownian motion process. A broad class of production policies is admitted: they may be nonstationary, non-Markovian, or, in fact, almost arbitrary. Control theory is used to show that, within this wide class of policies, a simple, stationary, two-number policy is optimal for the average cost minimization problem. This policy switches production on when it is currently off and net inventory reaches a low critical level, or switches it off when it is on and net inventory reaches a high critical level. Simple methods are developed for obtaining the optimal critical levels numerically. Examples are developed comparing the results with those given by Graves and Keilson for a different demand process having the same mean and variance per unit time.

## 10. Binding Versus Final-Offer Arbitration: A Combination is Best
### Author(s):
- Steven J. Brams
- Samuel Merrill, III
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
A new procedure is proposed for settling disputes which combines binding arbitration (BA) and final-offer arbitration (FOA). Unlike either of the two pure procedures, combined arbitration (CA) induces the two parties to converge in making their final offers.

## 11. NoteA Note on Economic Models for R&D Project Selection in the Presence of Project Interactions
### Author(s):
- Paula M. Goldstein
- Howard M. Singer
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
In their paper, Economic Models for R&D Project Selection in the Presence of Project Interactions, Fox, Baker, and Bryant (Fox, G. E., N. R. Baker, J. L. Bryant. 1984. Economic models for R and D project selection in the presence of project interactions. Management Sci.30 (July) 890902.) proposed a model that included benefit interactions, called present value (PV) interactions, between R&D projects. Several computational errors in this paper invalidated the illustrative example which sought to demonstrate that ignoring the PV interactions could result in both nonoptimal project selections and resource allocations. However, a single correction yields an example that supports the authors' central premise. Furthermore, we believe that the model itself can prove useful in real applications.

## 12. NoteAn Improved Conditional Monte Carlo Technique for the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem
### Author(s):
- Veena G. Adlakha
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1986
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation procedure for estimating the distribution function of the shortest path length in a network with random arc lengths. The method extends the concept of conditional Monte Carlo utilizing special properties of the Uniformly Directed Cutsets and the unique arcs. The objective here is to reduce the sampling effort and utilize known probability information to derive multivariate integrals of lower dimension. The experimental results show that the proposed method is substantially cost effective and performs better than traditional Monte Carlo and conditional methods.
