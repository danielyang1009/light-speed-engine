## 1. A Survey of Exact Algorithms for the Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem
### Author(s):
- lker Baybars
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
In this survey paper we discuss the development of the simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP); modifications and generalizations over time; present alternate 0-1 programming formulations and a general integer programming formulation of the problem; discuss other well-known problems related to SALBP; describe and comment on a number of exact (i.e., optimum-seeking) methods; and present a summary of the reported computational experiences. All models discussed here are deterministic (i.e., all input parameters are assumed to be known with certainty) and all the algorithms discussed are exact. The problem is termed simple in the sense that no mixed-models, subassembly lines, zoning restrictions, etc. are considered.

## 2. Financial Futures Hedging Via Goal Programming
### Author(s):
- Ramesh Sharda
- Kathryn D. Musser
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
This paper presents multiperiod, multiple objective goal programming as an alternative to the more conventional hedge ratio approaches to financial futures hedging. The described model offers the potential benefits of: (i) simultaneous achievement of multiple hedge-related objectives (i.e., minimization of transactions and margin opportunity costs; regulation of cash flow, and maximization of profits accruing from both the cash and futures positions); and (ii) periodic modification and updating of the futures position, as suggested by actual, observed prices and interest rates, throughout the hedging period.

## 3. Search Theory and the Manufacturing Progress Function
### Author(s):
- John F. Muth
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
A theory based upon random search within a fixed population of technological possibilities is used to explain the manufacturing progress function. The theory is consistent with the power function relation between unit costs and cumulative output that has frequently been observed. It is also consistent with initial rates of improvement smaller than those predicted later by the power function relation, the eventual cessation of cost reduction, and an irregularity of improvements. Existing theories in the literature either fail to agree with the main empirical phenomena or else assume precisely what they attempt to explain.

## 4. Arbitrating a Dispute: A Decision Analytic Approach
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
Many collective decision-making and bargaining situations can be described through the set of the feasible joint evaluations of all conceivable settlements. Attention should then be restricted to that subset (Pareto-optimal frontier) from which no joint gains are possible. Hence, the focal issue becomes which element of the Pareto-optimal subset should be chosen as a solution to the dispute. This paper proposes an arbitration procedure to address this issue. The proposed approach, decision-analytic in its nature, is inspired by LaValles (LaValle, I. H. 1978. Fundamentals of Decision Analysis. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York.) allocation-function approach (which is not specific on how to obtain an allocation function) and by Eliashberg and Winkler's (Eliashberg, J., R. L. Winkler. 1981. Risk sharing and group decision making. Management Sci.27 (November) 12211235.) work (which does not accommodate probability differences within the group). After the new approach is presented, its implications are examined for some likely scenarios and examples are considered.

## 5. Inventory Service-Level Measures: Convexity and Approximation
### Author(s):
- Paul Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
We argue that standard approximations for two often-used inventory service-level measures may perform poorly in many situations. Then we confirm the long-standing conjecture that the (relatively) exact formulas for these quantities are convex functions of the relevant control variables. Both results suggest the exact expressions should be seriously considered in practical work.

## 6. The Effect of Commonality on Safety Stock in a Simple Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
- Michael J. Magazine
- Henry L. W. Nuttle
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
We examine the effects of component commonality on optimal safety stock levels in a two-product, two-level inventory model. The criterion is to minimize system safety stock subject to a service level constraint. Although our model is specialized, its analysis provides insights not available in other multilevel inventory models.

## 7. Heuristics for Multilevel Lot-Sizing with a Bottleneck
### Author(s):
- Peter J. Billington
- John O. McClain
- L. Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
In this paper we present a heuristic method, based on Lagrangian relaxation, for multilevel lot-sizing when there is a single bottleneck facility. A series of Lagrangian relaxations (one for each item in the product structure) is imbedded in a branch and bound procedure. The objective is to find a production schedule that fits within available capacity at minimum cost. The method has two solution phases, dual and primal. In the dual phase of the procedure, implied costs of setups and production are determined based on a tentative schedule. The primal phase is repeated with these new prices and we iterate to reach a good solution.

## 8. A Generalized Network Formulation of the Pairwise Comparison Consensus Ranking Model
### Author(s):
- Jonathan Barzilai

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
One of the best known and most widely referenced models for representing ordinal preferences is that due to Kemeny and Snell (Kemeny, J. G., L. J. Snell. 1962. Preference ranking: an axiomatic approach. Mathematical Models in the Social Sciences. Glnn, New York, 923.). This model is designed to accommodate pairwise comparison data with an l1 norm used to measure voter disagreement. While this model possesses many of the necessary properties for a social choice function, solution procedures developed to date have been capable of handling only small problems due to the difficulty of modelling the transitivity requirements of an optimal consensus ranking. This paper shows how the consensus formation problem for strict linear orderings can be modelled as a generalized network. Since efficient computer codes already exist for handling this special structure, this approach will permit the solution of much larger problems than has been the case previously.

## 9. Game Theory and Cost Allocation Problems
### Author(s):
- S. H. Tijs
- T. S. H. Driessen
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
Problems of allocating joint costs in a reasonable way arise in many practical situations where people decide to work together to save costs. Cost allocation methods based on game theoretical concepts take into account the strategic aspects of cost allocation situations. We give a survey of cost allocation methods based on the nucleolus and the Shapley value, and introduce also a new one, the so-called cost gap allocation method which is based on the -value. It is shown that for some large subclasses of cost allocation problems this new cost allocation method coincides with old separable cost methods proposed in the thirties by the Tennessee Valley Authority and also with the separable costs-remaining benefits (SCRB) method. Properties of this cost gap allocation method are also treated.

## 10. A Game Theoretic Approach to Collections and Disbursements
### Author(s):
- Yair E. Orgler
- Yair Tauman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
Many firms use lock boxes serviced by local depository banks in an attempt to reduce collection float. Likewise, an increasing number of large firms use controlled disbursing to pay their bills, in order to increase and control their disbursement float. Almost all the literature treats the lock box location problem and the disbursement bank location problem separately.

## 11. Searching for Positive Returns at the Track: A Multinomial Logit Model for Handicapping Horse Races
### Author(s):
- Ruth N. Bolton
- Randall G. Chapman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1986
### Abstract:
This paper investigates fundamental investment strategies to detect and exploit the public's systematic errors in horse race wager markets. A handicapping model is developed and applied to win-betting in the pari-mutuel system. A multinomial logit model of the horse racing process is posited and estimated on a data base of 200 races. A recently developed procedure for exploiting the information content of rank ordered choice sets is employed to obtain more efficient parameter estimates. The variables in this discrete choice probability model include horse and jockey characteristics, plus several race-specific features. Hold-out sampling procedures are employed to evaluate wagering strategies. A wagering strategy that involves unobtrusive bets, with a side constraint eliminating long-shot betting, appears to offer the promise of positive expected returns, even in the presence of the typically large track take encountered at Thoroughbred racing events.
