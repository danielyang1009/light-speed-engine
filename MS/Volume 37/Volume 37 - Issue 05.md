## 1. Interaction of Judgemental and Statistical Forecasting Methods: Issues & Analysis
### Author(s):
- Derek Bunn

### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
This paper reviews several of the current controversies in the relative value of judgemental and statistical forecasting methods. Where expert, informed judgemental forecasts are being used, a critical analysis of the evidence suggests that their quality is higher than many researchers have previously asserted, and circumstances favourable to this are identified. The issue of the interaction of judgemental and statistical methods is, however, identified as a more worthwhile line of inquiry, and research in this area is reviewed, differentiating approaches aimed at synthesising both of these inputs.

## 2. Mean-Absolute Deviation Portfolio Optimization Model and Its Applications to Tokyo Stock Market
### Author(s):
- Hiroshi Konno

### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a portfolio optimization model using the L1 risk (mean absolute deviation risk) function can remove most of the difficulties associated with the classical Markowitz's model while maintaining its advantages over equilibrium models. In particular, the L1 risk model leads to a linear program instead of a quadratic program, so that a large-scale optimization problem consisting of more than 1,000 stocks may be solved on a real time basis. Numerical experiments using the historical data of NIKKEI 225 stocks show that the L1 risk model generates a portfolio quite similar to that of the Markowitz's model within a fraction of time required to solve the latter.

## 3. Accounting Implications of Corporate Diversification
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
This study investigates the direct effects of corporate diversification on accounting reports, and the implications of these effects for accounting research. The study shows that firms which diversify into unrelated areas of business devote a larger proportion of their capital investments to acquisitions and are, therefore, characterized by smaller differences between replacement-cost and historical-cost values of assets than undiversified firms. The implications of these findings, as well as other operating characteristics of diversified firms, for the following areas of accounting research are subsequently examined.

## 4. Optimal Linear Opinion Pools
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
Consider a decision problem involving a group of m Bayesians in which each member reports his/her posterior distribution for some random variable . The individuals all share a common prior distribution for  and a common loss function, but form their posterior distributions based on different data sets. A single distribution of  must be chosen by combining the individual posterior distributions in some type of opinion pool. In this paper, the optimal pool is presented when the data observed by the different members of the group are conditionally independent given . When the data are not conditionally independent, the optimal weights to be used in a linear opinion pool are determined for problems involving quadratic loss functions and arbitrary distributions for  and the data. Properties of the optimal procedure are developed and some examples are discussed.

## 5. Deriving and Analysing Optimal Strategies in Bayesian Models of Games
### Author(s):

- J. Q. Smith
### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
Wilson (1986) gives a backwards induction algorithm for sequentially obtaining the optimal next move in a repeated Bayesian game. In this paper we show how to identify the form of an optimal solution of such a game by a graphical procedure. By means of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, we illustrate how Wilson's algorithm can be enhanced using the derived analytic form of the solution to produce an explicit optimal strategy. We can then determine not only how P1 should play on all subsequent moves of the game, but also use ideas of Bayes rationality to discuss whether a given model of P2's reactions is realistic.

## 6. Sequencing to Minimize Work Overload in Assembly Lines with Product Options
### Author(s):
- Candace Arai Yano
- Ram Rachamadugu
### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
We address the problem of sequencing jobs, each of which is characterized by one of a large number of possible combinations of customer-specified options, on a paced assembly line. These problems arise frequently in the automotive industry. One job must be launched into the system at equal time intervals, where the time interval (or cycle time) is prespecified. The problem is to sequence the jobs to maximize the total amount of work completed, or equivalently, to minimize the total amount of incomplete work (or work overload).

## 7. A Crane Scheduling Problem in a Computer-Integrated Manufacturing Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
This paper addresses a crane scheduling and machine layout problem in a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Environment. A single crame is used to move all the Work-in-Process (WIP) in the system. The overall system objective is to maximize the yield rate subject to the flow time limit of the WIP. We formalize the problem, and analytically and empirically show that cyclic scheduling provides a near optimal solution, which is superior to dispatching rules. First, we illustrate the optimality and benefits of cyclic scheduling in a simple environment. Then, for multiple-product problems, we show that for a given sequence, finding the minimum cycle time becomes the maximum cost circular network flow problem in a graph. Based on the insights developed, a heuristic for sequencing product types in a cycle is derived that approximately minimizes the cycle time over all sequences. Finally, computational experiments are reported and various assertions made in the paper are empirically verified.

## 8. Information and Profitability Estimates: Modelling the Firm's Decision to Adopt a New Technology
### Author(s):
- Terence A. Oliva
### Published:
- 1 May 1991
### Abstract:
This paper uses a response surface based on catastrophe theory to examine the interaction of information and profitability estimates on the firm's adoption of a new technology or innovation. As such, the paper builds on the conceptual ideas behind McCardle's (1985) work. An illustrative example using simulated data is presented to indicate how one might operationalize the key constructs for the purpose of estimating the model.
