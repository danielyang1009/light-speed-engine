## 2. Dynamic Bargaining with Transaction Costs
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Cramton
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
A buyer and seller alternate making offers until an offer is accepted or someone terminates negotiations. The seller's valuation is common knowledge, but the buyer's valuation is known only by the buyer. Impatience to reach an agreement comes from two sources: the traders discount future payoffs and there are transaction costs of bargaining. Equilibrium behavior involves either immediate trade, delayed trade, or immediate termination, depending on the size of the gains from trade and the relative bargaining costs. This contrasts with the pure discounting model where termination never occurs, and the pure transaction cost model where delayed trade never occurs.

## 3. Final-Offer Arbitration Under Incomplete Information
### Author(s):
- William F. Samuelson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
In recent years, final-offer arbitration (FOA) has become an increasingly frequent means of resolving labor disputes in the private and public sectors. The present paper models FOA when each disputant has private information bearing on the true value of the case. The model characterizes the disputants' equilibrium offer behavior and examines arbitration performance. The main conclusion is that FOA outcomes are crudely responsive to the underlying merits of the case. In its favor, FOA can be expected to be less costly to administer than arbitration procedures that attempt to extract perfect information.

## 4. Problem Restructuring in Negotiation
### Author(s):
- Katia P. Sycara
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
To achieve movement towards a negotiated settlement, it is often necessary to restructure the problem under negotiation. Problem restructuring can lead to changed perception of the issues by the parties, thus breaking deadlocks and increasing the parties' willingness to compromise. We present a framework and mechanisms for problem restructuring based on the goals and goal relationships of the negotiating parties as well as means of manipulating the parties' utility estimates. In addition, previous negotiations are a source of heuristic advice in the restructuring task. The restructuring approach has been implemented in the PERSUADER, a computer program that acts as a labor mediator in labor management disputes. To achieve its task, the PERSUADER negotiates separately with each party, company and union, to guide them in reaching agreement.

## 5. Restructurable Representations of Negotiation
### Author(s):

- Zbig Koperczak
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
The paper introduces restructurable modelling of negotiation aimed at supporting decision situations with an evolving structure. The theoretical framework of such models is presented by means of a rule-based formalism. This framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative models, and the use of multiple procedures for solving the negotiation problem, adjusting the solution, and restructuring the problem representation. A hypothetical example of a house purchase is given to illustrate the discussion. The implications of the study for future directions of research on negotiation modelling and support are presented.

## 6. Airline Buyout: Evolutionary Systems Design and Problem Restructuring in Group Decision and Negotiation
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
We discuss problem restructuring involving evolution of the problem representation in group decision and negotiation support systems. We develop the evolutionary systems design (ESD) approach to restructuring involving a heuristic controls/goals/values referral process and other domain-independent methodological knowledge, such as constraint relaxation, contingency planning, coalition formation and flexible goal target. These ideas are applied to multiple problem restructuring in a scenario motivated by labor-management negotiations and buyout in the airline industry, in particular, a composite of negotiations at Eastern Airlines, TWA and UAL.

## 7. The Judgment Policies of Negotiators and the Structure of Negotiation Problems
### Author(s):
- Jeryl L. Mumpower
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
The structure of negotiation problems refers to characteristics of their feasible settlement spaces and efficient frontiers. These characteristics are determined by the joint distribution of negotiators' utilities across possible settlements. Variations in negotiators' judgment policies (i.e., how they judge the utility of potential settlements) may result in distinctly different negotiation problem structures. Depending on the structure of the negotiation problem, settlements that are efficient, maximize joint utility, and minimize inequality are sometimes possible, sometimes not. When such settlements are possible, different strategies may be necessary, to reach them. They sometimes can be reached only by a compromise strategy in which the disputants split their differences on each issue, sometimes only by a horsetrading strategy involving trade-offs among extreme values on issues, sometimes by either, and sometimes by neither strategy. Settlements on the efficient frontier that yield equal utility to both negotiators will sometimes leave both relatively well satisfied, sometimes not. When equal-valued settlements yield low levels of utility, negotiators are likely to feel dissatisfied and may presume that the other negotiator must be comparatively better satisfied. Even seemingly simple negotiation problems often pose a high degree of cognitive complexity. In the face of uncertainty about the nature of the problem structure, negotiators may resort to simple bargaining tactics (e.g., incrementally offering concessions on the issue for which the marginal rate of loss of utility is least). For many commonly encountered problem structures, such tactics lead toward satisfactory settlements, but not always. Analyses of the judgment policies of negotiators and resultant negotiation problem structures will contribute to better understanding of negotiation processes and help to inform the design of negotiation support systems.

## 8. Information Technology for Negotiating Groups: Generating Options for Mutual Gain

### Abstract:
The study of negotiating groups, whether distributive between competing parties (i.e., win-lose) or integrative between essentially friendly parties from the same organization (i.e., win-win), remains important. While much previous research in this area has focused on key analytical issues such as evaluating proposed options, much less research has addressed the equally important initial stage of negotiation: generating options for mutual gain. In general, groups do this poorly, as there are many obstacles that inhibit successful option generation. Recent advances in computer technology provide additional approaches that can be used to support option generation as one component in an overall Negotiation Support System. This paper presents an integrated series of laboratory and field studies that investigated various aspects of computer-supported option generation for groups that meet at the same place and time. The use of anonymity to separate personalities from the issues and promote more objective evaluation was found to improve option generation in some circumstances, particularly those with increased criticalness and/or power differences among the participants. Larger groups were found to be more effective than smaller groups, several smaller groups combined, and nominal groups. We present several implications for theory development and system design and use, as well as a tentative model for computer-supported group option generation.

## 9. Computer Support of Groups: Theory-Based Models for GDSS Research
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan Rao
- Sirkka L. Jarvenpaa
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1991
### Abstract:
Empirical research in the area of computer support of groups is characterized by inconsistent results across studies. This paper attempts to reconcile the inconsistencies by linking the ad hoc reasoning in the studies to existing theories of communication, minority influence and human information processing. Contingency models are then presented based on the theories discussed. The paper concludes by discussing the linkages between the current work and other recently published integrations of empirical GDSS research and theories of GDSS.
