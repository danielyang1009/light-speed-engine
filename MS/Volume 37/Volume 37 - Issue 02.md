## 1. Software Piracy: An Analysis of Protection Strategies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
Software piracy by users is generally believed to harm both software firms (through lower profits) and buying customers (through higher prices). Thus, it is thought that perfect and costless technological protection would benefit both firms and consumers. The model developed here suggests that in some circumstances, even with significant piracy, not protecting can be the best policy, both raising firm profits and lowering selling prices. Key to the analysis is joining the presence of a positive network externality with the fact that piracy increases the total number of program users. The network externality exists because consumers have an incentive to economize on post-purchase learning and customization costs.

## 2. Optimal Sequencing and Resource Allocation in Research and Development Projects
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The main purpose of this study is to construct a suitable research and development (R&D) model which would facilitate the analysis of activity sequencing and resource allocation in R&D projects. In the proposed model, essential characteristics of R&D projects are incorporated. Namely, the activities and the technological specifications of the project are selected dynamically, and the stopping time of the R&D process is introduced as a decision variable to be determined endogeneously. We characterize the collection of optimal sequencing of R&D activities that would maximize the expected net present value of the project, and we evaluate the possibility of incorporating various learning aspects into the model. We further analyze a resource allocation problem associated with the R&D model. It is shown that in certain cases one can efficiently implement a greedy-optimal resource allocation procedure for increasing the expected net present value of the R&D project.

## 3. Advertising Cost Interactions and the Optimality of Pulsing
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Whether pulsing, other than chattering, can be optimal is an important concern to both advertising practitioners and marketing scientists. In this paper, we explicitly incorporate various types of costs to a one-state advertising model to analyze the effect of these costs on the optimal advertising policy. We prove that the interaction of fixed and pulsing costs does make pulsing optimal under a reasonable condition. This result not only identifies an important factor that leads to the optimality of pulsing, but also generalizes the finding obtained by Sasieni (1971).

## 4. New Organizational Forms for Enhancing Innovation: The Case of Internal Corporate Joint Ventures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
Organizations have increasingly turned to alternative organizational forms such as joint ventures and internal corporate ventures to enhance innovation. The present study examines the use of a similar, newly-developing organizational form for purposes of innovation; namely, the internal corporate joint venture (ICJV), which has characteristics of both traditional joint ventures and internal corporate venturing. This study presents an industry-specific analysis of innovation across 53 ICJV's (hospital/physician group combinations), using qualitative and quantitative analyses to identify those factors most strongly associated with the degree of innovativeness in these new organizations. The empirical findings suggest three factors most significantly associated with innovation in the ICJV's in our sample: (1) age similarity among organizational members, (2) the sponsoring organization's orientation towards innovation, and (3) ICJV participation in integrative activities with the sponsoring organization. The study concludes by suggesting that greater attention be devoted to studying nested innovation, i.e., innovation within a new organizational form that is itself an administrative innovation.

## 5. Modeling a Multiprocessor System with Preemptive Priorities
### Author(s):

- Kumar S. Narayanan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
Consider a system with N processors and two job types with one having preemptive priority over the other. Arrivals are Poisson and service times are exponential. We present two approaches for modeling the system. The difference between the two lies in the order with which we list the numbers of jobs of each type in the system in the state definition. Although both approaches yield matrix-geometric solutions, their implications for computation are significantly different. The first approach has attractive structural properties and an easily solvable rate matrix, but the system of equations at the boundary is most often prohibitively large. The second approach, while not amenable to any easy computation of its rate matrix, renders itself to an efficient solution at the boundary, and provides a basis for waiting time analysis for low priority jobs. In the paper, we present an efficient implementation of state reduction for solving the stationary probabilities associated with the boundary states. We give a numerical example to highlight various issues in the computer solution.

## 6. Arc Reduction and Path Preference in Stochastic Acyclic Networks
### Author(s):
- Jonathan F. Bard
- James E. Bennett
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
The paper presents a heuristic for determining the path that maximizes the expected utility of a stochastic acyclic network. The focus is on shortest route problems where a general, nonlinear utility function is used to measure outcomes. For such problems, enumerating all feasible paths is the only way to guarantee that the global optimum has been found. Alternatively, we develop a reduction algorithm based on stochastic dominance to speed up the computations. Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the approach. In all, 70 test problems comprising 20 to 60 nodes are randomly generated and analyzed. The results indicate that the heuristic produces significant computational saving as the size of the network grows, and that the quality of the reduced network solutions are better than those obtained from the original formulation.

## 7. An Information Processing Model of a Police Organization
### Author(s):
- B. W. Simms
- E. R. Petersen
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
A model has been developed to study economic decision making in police organizations. The conceptual viewpoint taken is that police organizations are information processing systems, with activities connected in a communication network. The resulting model is process-oriented, and organizational decisions are analyzed by studying how the police force senses, learns about, and solves a stream of criminal events. Search theory is used to model the information processing activities and to study the value of unit memory, communication between units and the coordination of two or more units. A computer model links the units and activities in a simulation of the police force organization. Examples based on a municipal police force are used to highlight the concepts of the model building approach. The implementation of the computer model using police force data is reported.

## 8. The Maximal Covering Location Problem with Capacities on Total Workload
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1991
### Abstract:
The Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) has been the focus of considerable attention both in research and practice for some time, and numerous extensions have been proposed to broaden its appeal and enhance its applicability. In this paper, we are concerned with the addition of workload limits on the facilities. While not generally difficult to formulate, these capacity constraints make the model substantially more difficult to solve, as well as create certain pathological results, particularly in the assignment of uncovered demand to facilities. First we discuss these pathologies and extend the capacitated MCLP to address them. Then, we present an efficient solution procedure that is applicable to both simple and extended problem formulations. Finally, results of extensive tests on the solution procedure are presented and a real-world scale example is solved to explore the implications of the model.
