## 1. Measuring the Long-Term Effects of Public Policy: The Case of Narcotics Use and Property Crime

### Published:

### Abstract:
The effects of treatment and legal supervision on narcotics use and criminal activities were assessed by applying newly developed time-series methods that disentangle the long-term (permanent) and the short-term (temporary) effects of intervention. A multivariate systems approach was used to characterize the dynamic interplay of several related behaviors at a group level over a long period of time. Five variablesabstinence from narcotics use, daily narcotics use (or addiction), property crime, methadone maintenance treatment, and legal supervisionwere derived by aggregating information from over 600 narcotic addiction histories averaging 12 years in length. Because of the long assessment period, age was also included as a control variable.

## 2. The Efficiency of One Long Run Versus Independent Replications in Steady-State Simulation
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
We evaluate the efficiency of one long run versus independent replications in steady-state discrete-event simulation, assuming that an initial portion of each replication will be deleted to allow the process to approach steady state. We provide supporting evidence in favor of one long run, but we also show that multiple replications can be more efficient. The advantage of one long run increases if the amount deleted increases or if the covariance function decreases more quickly (assuming it is nonnegative and decreasing). Thus, assuming that the amount deleted depends on the way the process approaches steady state, one long run tends to be efficient when the covariance function decays rapidly compared to the rate the process approaches steady state. We also discuss ways to determine the initial portion to delete. We consider the case of an exponential covariance function in detail, and use it as a basis for approximations. We also consider the M/G/ queueing model and reflected Brownian motion, the latter as an approximation for the G/G/1 queueing model. For these models starting at the origin, one long run is efficient, but a moderate number of independent replications is essentially equally efficient. In agreement with Kelton and Law (1984), for such examples our analysis only rules out many replications of very short runs.

## 3. Nondeterministic Polling Systems
### Author(s):
- Mandyam M. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
A nondeterministic polling system is considered in which a single server serves a number of stations. The service discipline at each station is, consistently, either nonexhaustive, semiexhaustive, gated, or exhaustive. If the server polls a station i which uses either the nonexhaustive or the semiexhaustive service discipline, then the next station polled is station j with probability pij if there was service at station i. The service time at station i is a random variable which may depend on the station polled next. If no service is performed at station i, then the next station polled is station j with probability eij. The time to switch between stations i and j is a random variable which may depend on whether service was performed at station i or not.

## 4. Strategic Interpolative Design of Dynamic Manufacturing Systems Layouts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
This paper presents a proactive strategic methodology for designing dynamic layouts for the expansion (or decline) phase of manufacturing systems. The methodology first estimates probable scenarios of the system requirements at its maturity level, strategically designs mature layouts given the set of scenarios, then tactically interpolates intermediate layouts, backward to the initial facilities plan.

## 5. Algorithms for the Multi-Resource Generalized Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- Bezalel Gavish
- Hasan Pirkul
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
The multi-resource generalized assignment problem is encountered when a set of tasks have to be assigned to a set of agents in a way that permits assignment of multiple tasks to an agent subject to the availability of a set of multiple resources consumed by that agent. This problem differs from the generalized assignment problem in that an agent consumes not just one but a variety of resources in performing the tasks assigned to him.

## 6. An Extensible Visual Environment for Construction and Analysis of Hierarchically-Structured Models of Resource Contention Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The development of models for evaluating the performance of resource contention systems, such as manufacturing systems, computer systems, and communication networks, is often a difficult and complex task. This modeling effort can be dramatically reduced by the use of appropriate software tools. The Research Queueing Package Modeling Environment (RESQME) provides a graphical environment for constructing, solving, and analyzing the results of extended queueing network models of resource contention systems. It supports a rich underlying modeling paradigm previously developed in the Research Queueing Package (RESQ) and provides a single integrated graphical interface throughout all tasks of the modeling lifecycle. In this paper we present a brief overview of RESQME and then focus on two of its most important features: the construction and analysis of hierarchically-structured models and the ability to extend and customize the RESQME environment for domain-specific modeling via the use of user-defined modeling elements. A manufacturing model is developed in order to illustrate these capabilities.

## 7. Strict vs. Weak Ordinal Relations for Multipliers in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Agha Iqbal Ali
- Wade D. Cook
- Lawrence M. Seiford
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Golany (1988) proposes an interesting extension of Data Envelopment Analysis to the situation where ordinal relations among weights corresponding to certain dimensions exist. However, the development of the extended model contains mathematical errors and the proposed equivalence is incorrect.

## 8. NoteExtensions of Palm's Theorem: A Review
### Author(s):
- Manuel J. Carrillo
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
This note reviews the transient behavior the M/G/ queue with nonhomogeneous Poisson or compound Poisson input and nonstationary service distribution. In the case of nonhomogeneous Poisson input, the number of customers in the queueing system over time turns out to have a Poisson distribution. The generality of the nonhomogeneity/nonstationarity assumptions and the ease of use of the resulting Poisson distribution broaden the area of applications for Poisson models. These results have found use in modeling multi-echelon repair systems in situations where the number of arrivals or number in service has a variance-to-mean ratio of unity (the Poisson case) or greater than unity.

## 9. NoteThe Mean-Coefficient-of-Variation Rule: The Lognormal Case
### Author(s):
- Haim Levy
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1991
### Abstract:
The mean-variance (M-V) rule may lead to paradoxical results which may be resolved by employing the mean coefficient of variation (M-C) rule. It is shown that the M-C rule constitutes an optimal decision rule for lognormal distributions.
