## 1. FW/SM: A Prototype Structured Modeling Environment
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
A research prototype implementation has been evolving for several years in parallel with the vision, theory, language, and applicative aspects of structured modeling. The objective of this article is to describe the capabilities of this implementation as it now stands, and to comment on how it contributes toward fulfilling a previously published agenda for the development of a new generation of modeling environments. The intended audience is all modeling system designers and evaluators, including those who do not happen to take a structured modeling approach.

## 2. Multiple Market Entry, Cost Signalling and Entry Deterrence
### Author(s):
- Kannan Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
A low-cost incumbent may limit price to informatively signal her cost to an uncertain potential entrant, and therefore deter entry. We enrich this model by investigating the strategic pricing behavior of the incumbent when she operates in multiple markets. We demonstrate that the low-cost incumbent's ability to separate from a ghost high-cost type is enhanced when she combines her signalling effort across markets, instead of independent signalling in each market. We show that, in the combined least-cost signalling, the low-cost incumbent limit prices in each market. In an attempt to minimize dissipative but informative signalling costs, the low-cost incumbent may enter unprofitable markets, but exit after credible separation.

## 3. Ordering and Production Decisions with Supply Quality and Demand Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
In this paper, we solve a production planning problem that has a direct bearing on the cost to a facility of vendor quality and reliability. This solution is also an important first step in solving the multi-plant coordination problem.

## 5. Scheduling of Project Networks by Job Assignment
### Author(s):
- Andreas Drexl
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
A recurring problem in project management involves the allocation of scarce resources to the individual jobs comprising the project. In many situations such as audit scheduling, the resources correspond to individuals (skilled labour). This naturally leads to an assignment type project scheduling problem, i.e. a project has to be processed by assigning one of several individuals (resources) to each job. In this paper we consider the nonpreemptive variant of a resource-constrained project job-assignment problem, where job durations as well as costs depend upon the assigned resource. Regarding precedence relations as well as release dates and deadlines, the question arises, to which jobs resources should be assigned in order to minimize overall costs. For solving this time-resource-cost-tradeoff problem we present a hybrid brand and bound/dynamic programming algorithm with a (rather efficient Monte Carlo type) heuristic upper bounding technique as well as various relaxation procedures for determining lower bounds. Computational results are presented as well.

## 6. Comparison of Weighting Judgments in Multiattribute Utility Measurement
### Author(s):
- Katrin Borcherding

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
This paper compares four weighting methods in multiattribute utility measurement: the ratio method, the swing weighting method, the tradeoff method and the pricing out method. 200 subjects used these methods to weight attributes for evaluating nuclear waste repository sites in the United States. The weighting methods were compared with respect to their internal consistency, convergent validity, and external validity. Internal consistency was measured by the degree to which ordinal and cardinal or ratio responses agreed within the same weighting method. Convergent validity was measured by the degree of agreement between the weights elicited with different methods. External validity was determined by the degree to which weights elicited in this experiment agreed with weights that were elicited with managers of the Department of Energy. In terms of internal consistency, the tradeoff method fared worst. In terms of convergent validity, the pricing out method turned out to be an outlier. In terms of external validity, the pricing out method showed the best results. While the ratio and swing methods are quite consistent and show a fair amount of convergent validity, their external validity problems cast doubt on their usefulness. The main recommendation for applications is to improve the internal consistency of the tradeoff method by careful interactive elicitation and to use it in conjunction with the pricing out method to enhance its external validity.

## 7. Resource-Use Efficiency in Public Schools: A Study of Connecticut Data
### Author(s):
- Subhash C. Ray
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
This study combines Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with regression modelling to estimate relative efficiency in the public school districts of Connecticut. Factors affecting achievements are classified as school inputs and other socio-economic factors. DEA is performed with the school inputs only. Efficiency measures obtained from DEA are subsequently related to the socio-economic factors in a regression model with a one-sided disturbance term. The findings suggest that while productivity of school inputs varies considerably across districts this can be ascribed to a large extent to differences in the socio-economic background of the communities served. Variation in managerial efficiency is much less than what is implied by the DEA results.

## 8. The Minimum Common-Cycle Algorithm for Cyclic Scheduling of Two Material Handling Hoists with Time Window Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
The problem of cyclic scheduling of two hoists is defined as follows. There are N + 1 workstations, S0, S1, , SN, and two identical hoists that move jobs between stations. Jobs are identical and each job has to visit all stations in the order that stations are numbered. It is assumed that the hoist traveling times between stations are given constants. Each station can hold one job at a time, and each job must remain at station Si, for a period of at least ai and at most bi time units. Both ai and bi, i = 2, , N, are given constants. Define mi, 0  i  N, to be a move of a job from Si to Si+1. A cyclic schedule determines the order of N + 1 moves, mi, i = 0, 1, , N, an assignment of these moves to hoists, and the start time of the moves in a cycle. The problem is to find a cyclic schedule that minimizes the total time (the cycle time) to complete all the N + 1 moves.

## 9. Multinomial Approximating Models for Options with k State Variables
### Author(s):
- Bardia Kamrad
- Peter Ritchken
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1991
### Abstract:
Contingent claims whose values depend on multiple sources of uncertainty arise in many financial contracts and in the analysis of real projects. Unfortunately closed form solutions for these options are rare and numerical methods can be computationally expensive. This article extends the literature on multinomial approximating models. Specifically, new multinomial models are presented that include as special cases existing models. The more general models are shown to be computationally more efficient.
