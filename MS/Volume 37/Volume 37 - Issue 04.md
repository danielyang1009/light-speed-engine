## 1. Resource Allocation Models with Risk Aversion and Probabilistic Dependence: Offshore Oil and Gas Bidding
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Bidding for offshore U.S. oil and gas leases is a major corporate resource allocation problem involving enormous uncertainties and very high stakes. This paper presents two new, operationally useful decision analysis models to aid in bidding for oil and gas leases. They are unique in that they consider risk aversion and probabilistic dependence among the values of the leases, with both bid levels and partnership shares as (continuous) decision variables. They are suitable for use in evaluating proposed bidding policies or as objective functions in optimization formulations. Practicality of their data requirements is evidenced by use of one of the models for several years in a major oil company. Comparison of optimal solutions to these models on a small example, using actual oil-company data, demonstrates the importance of taking risk aversion and probabilistic dependence into account, and provides insight into the adequacy of independence and conditional dependence as approximations for dependence. These results are pertinent to other real-world allocation problems that share many of the characteristics of bidding problems, such as R&D funds allocation.

## 2. SSB and Weighted Linear Utility As Expected Utility with Suspicion
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
We show that a suspicious subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizer, i.e., one who treats potential consequences of states as information useful in assessing the probability of those states, may under reasonable circumstances act as though he were maximizing either weighted linear utility, or skew-symmetric bilinear (SSB) utility. SEU with suspicion, therefore, explains at least as many empirical violations of SEU theory as do these and similar models. We give examples to illustrate how several important types of SEU violations may seem to arise when suspicion is present.

## 3. Cyclical Schedules for Capacitated Lot Sizing with Dynamic Demands
### Author(s):
- Gerard M. Campbell
- Vincent A. Mabert
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
Cyclical scheduling, where the time between production periods for each item is constant, offers simplicity and ease of control compared with noncyclical scheduling, where production periods are irregularly spaced. However, when demands are dynamic, flexibility in the spacing of production periods permits noncyclical scheduling to result in lower total costs. This study investigates the additional cost of cyclical scheduling.

## 4. Sole Versus Dual Sourcing in Stochastic Lead-Time (s, Q) Inventory Models

### Abstract:
When supply lead times are uncertain, the simultaneous procurement from two sources offers savings in inventory holding and shortage costs. Economies are achieved if these savings outweigh the increase in ordering costs. In this paper we analyze dual sourcing in the context of the reorder point, order quantity inventory model with constant demand and stochastic lead times and compare it with single sourcing. Two cases are studied, using the uniform and the exponential distributions, which may be thought of as two extreme ways of representing stochastic lead times. In our two-vendor model, the order quantity is split equally between the two vendors and the split orders are placed simultaneously when the inventory position reaches the reorder level. A comparison of the total expected costs suggests that when the uncertainty in the lead times is high and the ordering costs are low, dual sourcing could be cost effective.

## 5. Variance Effects in Cyclic Production Systems
### Author(s):
- Debashish Sarkar
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
Utilizing a cyclic queue system, this paper investigates the effect of variance on a multi-item production facility. The variance of setup time, service rate and arrival rate is shown to have a powerful and sometimes paradoxical influence. Reduction in setup time, for example, is usually presumed to reduce inventory. We demonstrate that inventory can blow up if setup time is cut. Another paradoxical effect of variance is on processing rate. Speeding up the processing rate should reduce the material waiting to be processed. Again we show that the opposite can hold. Other properties of variance are examined, such as its relationship to KAIZEN and Just-In-Time production practices, and especially its property of impairing capacity.

## 6. Optimizing Processing Rates for Flexible Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- Paul J. Schweitzer
- Abraham Seidmann
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
This paper introduces the generic concept of processing rates as decision variables in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS's). The objective is to determine the minimum cost processing rates given the FMS throughput target, the work-in-process level, part routes, transporter delays, and the variable capacity cost function for each machine. A nonlinear Mean Value Analysis queueing network optimization methodology is developed to control bottlenecks and queue lengths as the processing rates are varied. This methodology further provides the average and marginal unit production costs along with necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions for the FMS throughput targets. Industrial sample data is then used to illustrate the solution of the optimal tool speed problem in a metal-cutting FMS. Considerable cost savings are demonstrated using the proposed methodology in contrast with the conventional one-machine optimization models. Several economic insights regarding the issues of capacity allocation for FMS's, and a generalization of the square root capacity allocation rule for closed networks of queues, are also presented.

## 7. Modelling Effectiveness-Equity Trade-Offs in Public Service Delivery Systems
### Author(s):
- Marvin B. Mandell
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
Distributional equity is a particularly salient objective in public sector decision making, in general, and decision making concerning the delivery of public services such as education, libraries, sanitation, and public safety, in particular. In this paper two related bicriteria mathematical programming models are developed for identifying the trade-offs between overall output (effectiveness) and equity that result from alternative allocations of service resources among different service delivery sites (branches). The models developed here incorporate equity in a more satisfactory manner than have previous efforts. An illustrative application of the models to the allocation of new books among the branches of a public library system is presented.

## 8. The Transaction Costs Theory of Joint Ventures: An Empirical Study of Japanese Subsidiaries in the United States
### Author(s):
- Jean-Franois Hennart
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1991
### Abstract:
This paper offers the first large sample empirical study of the factors which influence the choice of Japanese firms between full or partial ownership of their U.S. manufacturing subsidiaries. It studies for the first time the ownership policies of investors of a single home country in a single host country, thus keeping variations within home and host countries constant. One methodological improvement over previous studies is the use as independent variables of the relevant characteristics of the investing firms. These had been proxied in previous studies by data on U.S. industries entered.
