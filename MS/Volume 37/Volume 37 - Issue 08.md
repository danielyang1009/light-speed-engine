### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the general dynamic lot size model, or (generalized) Wagner-Whitin model. Let n denote the number of periods into which the planning horizon is divided. We describe a simple forward algorithm which solves the general model in 0(n log n) time and 0(n) space, as opposed to the well-known shortest path algorithm advocated over the last 30 years with 0(n2) time.

### Abstract:
Computer systems to support decision-making, planning, and negotiation in groups have the potential for wide-ranging application. However, knowledge of their effects is sparse, particularly for difficult situations such as group conflict. This study reports a laboratory experiment to examine how a general purpose group decision support system (GDSS) influenced conflict management in small groups making a budget allocation decision. The study tests a model that posits that GDSS impacts on conflict outcomes are mediated by group interaction processes, particularly how the GDSS enters into group interaction. The model posits seven potential impactssome positive and some negativethat GDSS technology might have on conflict interaction processes. The impacts do not automatically occur, but depend on the nature of the GDSS and how the group applies it. Hence, a given GDSS might result only in a subset of the seven impacts. Among other things, the model predicts that the particular combination of GDSS impacts that materializes differs across groups and that the balance of these impacts, positive or negative, determines positive or negative conflict outcomes.

## 3. Sources of Superior Performance: Market Share Versus Industry Effects in the U.S. Brewing Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
Using financial measures of performance we investigate the sources of value creation in the U.S. brewing industry between 1969 and 1979. We find that market share gains in this industry at this time are not correlated with changes in value and that the performance of individual leading firms is highly correlated. Our interpretation is that the success of market share building strategies depends critically on specific industry conditions. Specifically, in the absence of fundamental shifts in the relative resource positions of individual firms, share gains may come at too high a price. In addition, the research shows that intra-industry correlations in returns may result from excessive competition rather than collusion.

### Abstract:
This paper presents a mathematical model that selects locations for Internal Revenue Service Posts-of-Duty. The system is microcomputer-based and uses menus and graphically displayed zip code maps of IRS districts for interactive inputs and solution outputs. The mathematical model used for this problem is the uncapacitated, fixed charge, location-allocation model which minimizes travel and facility costs, given a specified level of activity. A greedy-interchange heuristic is used to obtain good solutions to the problem and is coupled with a lagrangian-relaxation technique providing a measure of how far from optimality the current solution can be. An example with Florida data illustrates the use of the model.

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis for Mean-Variance Portfolio Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
This paper shows how to perform sensitivity analysis for Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio problems using a general form of parametric quadratic programming. The analysis allows an investor to examine how parametric changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints affect the composition, mean, and variance of the optimal portfolio. The optimal portfolio and associated multipliers are piecewise linear functions of the changes in either the means or the right-hand side of the constraints. The parametric parts of the solution show the rates of substitution of securities in the optimal portfolio, while the parametric parts of the multipliers show the rates at which constraints are either tightening or loosening. Furthermore, the parametric parts of the solution and multipliers change in different intervals when constraints become active or inactive. The optimal MV paths for sensitivity analyses are piecewise parabolic, as in traditional MV analysis. However, the optimal paths may contain negatively sloping segments and are characterized by types of kinks, i.e., points of nondifferentiability, not found in MV analysis.

## 6. Parkinson's Law and Its Implications for Project Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
Critical path models concerning project management (i.e. PERT/CPM) fail to account for work force behavioral effects on the expected project completion time. In this paper, we provide a modelling framework for project management activities, that ultimately accounts for expected worker behavior under Parkinson's Law. A stochastic activity completion time model is used to formally state Parkinson's Law. The developed model helps to examine the effects of information release policies on subcontractors of project activities, and to develop managerial policies for setting appropriate deadlines for series or parallel project activities.

## 7. The Impact of Processing Time Knowledge on Dynamic Job-Shop Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
The goal of this paper is to determine if the results for dynamic job-shop scheduling problems are affected by the assumptions made with regard to the processing time distributions and the scheduler's knowledge of the processing times. Three dynamic job-shop scheduling problems (including a two-station version of Conway et al.'s 1967 nine-station symmetric shop) are tested under seven different scenarios, one deterministic and six stochastic, using computer simulation. The deterministic scenario, where the processing times are exponential and observed by the scheduler, has been considered in many simulation studies, including Conway et al.'s. The six stochastic scenarios include the case where the processing times are exponential and only the mean is known by the scheduler, and five different cases where the machines are subject to unpredictable failures. Two policies were tested, the shortest expected processing time (SEPT) rule, and a rule derived from a Brownian analysis of the corresponding queueing network scheduling problem. Although the SEPT rule performed well in the deterministic scenario, it was easily outperformed by the Brownian policies in the six stochastic scenarios for all three problems. Thus, the results from simulation studies of dynamic, deterministic job-shop scheduling problems may not carry over to the more realistic setting where there is unpredictable variability.

## 8. An Analytic Congestion Model for Closed Production Systems with IFR Processing Times
### Author(s):
- Mark L. Spearman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
We present an analytic model relating the mean cycle time or throughput as a function of the number of jobs in a closed production system composed of a tandem network of queues having exponential and/or IFR processing times. This model exhibits macroscopic behavior that is predicted by results from queueing theory and involves three meaningful parameters: the bottleneck rate and the raw process time that can be determined from first moment data; and a dimensionless congestion coefficient that is typically obtained from a single WIP/average cycle time observation (e.g., simulation).

## 9. Models of Tradeoffs in a Hierarchical Structure of Objectives
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
Multiattribute utility models and cost-benefit models often arrange the objectives into a hierarchical structure in order to identify appropriate subobjectives and to select appropriate attributes to measure the subobjectives. This paper discusses nonadditive models that use the hierarchical structure in order to examine issues of tradeoffs that models in present use are not able to include. The models are sufficiently structured so that they can be applied by procedures that are similar to those available for other prescriptive models of preferences.

## 10. Simultaneous Determination of Lot Sizes and Routing Mix in Job Shops
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
Flexibility and versatility of batch production job shops has increased in the last 25 years through the use of multi-purpose numerically controlled (NC) machine tools; these computer controlled machines can perform a wide variety of different operations. In recent years, even greater flexibility has been achieved by flexible manufacturing systems, where groups of NC machines are linked by automated material handling devices and controlled by computer. In such shops, a batch of product may have several possible alternative routes that it may follow through the shop. A number of researchers have shown that determining the proper mix of routes for each product can have a significant effect on shop throughput and work-in-process inventory. Other researchers have found that the lot sizing decision also affects these performance measures. The primary thrust of this paper is to develop a model to explore the interaction between routing and lot sizing decisions in a multi-machine, multi-work center job shop. A heuristic is developed for simultaneously determining lot sizes and routing mix in problems of practical size, and numerical examples are provided in order to illustrate the solution method. The examples show that there can be considerable potential for performance improvement by simultaneous consideration of routing and lot sizing.

## 11. NoteOptimal Inspection Policy in Sequential Screening
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1991
### Abstract:
Under sequential screening, a production lot is inspected item-by-item; the decision is made after inspecting each item whether to inspect another item or to reject the remainder of the lot; and thus uninspected items are never accepted. This screening process is a special case of the sequential sampling considered in Wortham and Wilson (1971). The process is formulated as an optimal stopping problem using a Bayesian approach. Based on an analysis of the structural properties of the optimal policy, a backward-recursive optimal algorithm, which is more efficient than the existing algorithm for optimal sequential sampling, is developed.
