## 1. A Model to Evaluate Variables Impacting the Productivity of Software Maintenance Projects
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The cost of maintaining application software has been rapidly escalating, and is currently estimated to comprise from 5080% of corporate information systems department budgets. In this research we develop an estimable production frontier model of software maintenance, using a new methodology that allows the simultaneous estimation of both the production frontier and the effects of several productivity factors. Our model allows deviations on both sides of the estimated frontier to reflect the impact of both production inefficiencies and random effects such as measurement errors.

## 2. Joint Ventures and the Option to Expand and Acquire
### Author(s):
- Bruce Kogut
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
This article develops the perspective that joint ventures are created as real options to expand in response to future technological and market developments. The exercise of the option is accompanied by an acquisition of the venture. It is hypothesized that the timing of the acquisition should be triggered by a product market signal indicating an increase in the venture's valuation. Based on a sample of 92 manufacturing joint ventures, this hypothesis is tested by estimating the effect of product market signals on the hazard of acquisition. The results indicate that unexpected growth in the product market increases the likelihood of acquisition; unexpected shortfalls in product shipments have no effect on the likelihood of dissolution. This asymmetry in the results strongly supports the interpretation of joint ventures as options to expand.

## 3. Stale in the Saddle: CEO Tenure and the Match Between Organization and Environment
### Author(s):
- Danny Miller
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
It has often been argued that an organization's strategy and structure must be tailored or matched to the challenges posed by its environment. Our research shows that this match is less likely to be achieved by long-tenured CEO's than by their counterparts with less tenure. It also suggests that the failure to match strategy and environment hurts financial performance. More specifically, CEO tenure related inversely to the prescribed match between organization and environment, especially in uncertain settings and where ownership was concentrated. The match between environment and strategy was in turn positively related to financial performance.

## 4. Solving Multi-Item Lot-Sizing Problems Using Strong Cutting Planes
### Author(s):
- Yves Pochet
- Laurence A. Wolsey
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
We consider two classes of multi-item lot-sizing problems. The first is a class of single stage problems involving joint machine capacity constraints and/or start up costs, and the second is a class of multistage problems with general product structure.

## 5. Evaluation of One-for-One Replenishment Policies for Multiechelon Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Antony Svoronos
- Paul Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with multiechelon inventory systems, where each demand triggers a separate order (one-for-one replenishment policies). The exogenous demands are independent Poisson processes. The transit times between locations may be stochastic. The way we model these transit times follows closely the standard treatment of stochastic leadtimes in single-location models. This is different, however, from the usual approach in the multiechelon setting (e.g., METRIC).

## 6. The Pointwise Stationary Approximation for Queues with Nonstationary Arrivals
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
We empirically explore the accuracy of an easily computed approximation for long run, average performance measures such as expected delay and probability of delay in multiserver queueing systems with exponential service times and periodic (sinusoidal) Poisson arrival processes. The pointwise stationary approximation is computed by integrating over time (that is taking the expectation of) the formula for the stationary performance measure with the arrival rate that applies at each point in time. This approximation, which has been empirically confirmed as a tight upper bound of the true value, is shown to be very accurate for a range of parameter values corresponding to a reasonably broad spectrum of real systems.

## 7. Constructing School Timetables Using Simulated Annealing: Sequential and Parallel Algorithms
### Author(s):
- D. Abramson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
This paper considers a solution to the school timetabling problem. The timetabling problem involves scheduling a number of tuples, each consisting of class of students, a teacher, a subject and a room, to a fixed number of time slots. A Monte Carlo scheme called simulated annealing is used as an optimisation technique. The paper introduces the timetabling problem, and then describes the simulated annealing method. Annealing is then applied to the timetabling problem. A prototype timetabling environment is described followed by some experimental results. A parallel algorithm which can be implemented on a multiprocessor is presented. This algorithm can provide a faster solution than the equivalent sequential algorithm. Some further experimental results are given.

## 8. NoteGains from International Dual Listing
### Author(s):
- Joseph Yagil
- Zivan Forshner
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
This study presents an attempt to explain how international dual listing of securities can reduce the effects of segmented international markets. By applying the mean-variance model we show that, for a return generating process given by the maximum distribution, the expected return on the dually listed security will be higher and the variance associated with it will be lower than for an otherwise identical (domestically) single listed security. This result appears to be consistent with the existence of dually listed securities in capital markets which are otherwise not integrated.

## 9. A Note on Level Schedules for Mixed-Model Assembly Lines in Just-in-Time Production Systems
### Author(s):
- Wieslaw Kubiak
- Suresh Sethi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1991
### Abstract:
This note formulates an assignment problem for obtaining optimal level schedules for mixed-model assembly lines in JIT production systems. The problem was formulated as a quadratic integer programming problem in a recent paper by Miltenburg (1989) where, however, only enumerative algorithms and heuristics were proposed for its solution. Our assignment formulation can also be extended to more general objective functions than the one used by Miltenburg.
