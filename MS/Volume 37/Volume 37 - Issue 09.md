### Abstract:
A simulation model that estimates individual health care spending as a function of the structure of indemnity-type insurance plans is presented. The behavioral models that form the basis for this work were developed as part of RAND's Health Insurance Experiment, (HIE), a randomized clinical trial. The randomized design and statistical methods provided estimates of the effects of insurance on use, uncontaminated by sickness or selection effects. The demand for medical care was modelled using episodes of treatment. Within the simulation, episodes occur independently and randomly through time according to a Poisson process with rates depending on individual characteristics and insurance. Empirical results from the HIE indicate that insurance primarily affects individual decisions to seek treatment (episode frequency), but has only minimal effects on episode costs. The response to changes in price (insurance) is modelled as a Bernoulli censoring process on episode frequency. The model is used to address issues on the effective design of insurance plans.

## 2. Complementary Resources and Cooperative Research: A Model of Research Joint Ventures Among Competitors
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
We present a model of research joint ventures in which if firms have highly complementary skills and resources then they prefer to cooperate in areas where the technology is highly appropriable, as in applied research. The model also indicates that large firms have a greater incentive to cooperate because they are better positioned to capture the benefits of a research venture. These findings seem to explain why cooperative research among rival firms in Japan has been applied rather than basic and conducted frequently among large companies. But firms prefer as small a partner as possible to limit the sharing of research results, creating a tension that may make cooperative efforts among rivals difficult to manage. For this reason, cooperation with organizations, such as universities or nonprofit institutions, may be a viable alternative for firms looking for complementary skills and resources.

## 3. The Effects of Organizational Context on Quality Management: An Empirical Investigation

### Abstract:
While the quality literature abounds with prescriptions for how quality should be managed, no one has proposed an organization-theory explanation for how quality is managed in organizations. This paper proposes a system-structural model of quality management that relates organizational quality context, actual quality management, ideal quality management, and quality performance. The relationships between organizational quality context and actual and ideal quality management are investigated using data collected from 152 managers from 77 business units of 20 manufacturing and service companies. A previously reported instrument is used to measure managers' perceptions of ideal and actual quality management in terms of eight critical factors including product/service design, training, employee relations, and top management leadership. Several measures are used to characterize organizational quality context including company type, company size, degree of competition, and corporate support for quality. The results indicate that organizational quality context influences managers' perceptions of both ideal and actual quality management. This suggests that knowledge of organizational quality context is useful for explaining and predicting quality management practice. Important contextual variables are corporate support for quality, past quality performance, managerial knowledge, and the extent of external quality demands.

## 4. Designing Telecommunications Networks for the Reseller Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for minimizing the monthly cost of telecommunications networks characterized by multichannel queues with forced balking and hierarchical routing plans. The problem is of major interest to resellers of long distance services and corporate network managers who lease their lines from AT&T and Other Common Carriers. The algorithm can be used to select the most economical combination of lines to meet a desired grade of service, set here to an average blockage rate of 1% during the busy hour.

## 5. Soviet Multi-Objective Mathematical Programming Methods: An Overview
### Author(s):
- Elliot R. Lieberman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
Over the past 2030 years multi-objective mathematical programming (MOMP) has emerged as an increasingly active area of research in the fields of management science, operations research, applied mathematics, and engineering. Despite the intensity of interest, however, earlier surveys of MOMP methods have all but ignored Soviet work in this area. Published in unfamiliar journals and often available only in Russian, the Soviet research has remained virtually unknown outside of the USSR and Eastern Europe. This has been particularly unfortunate given the extent, importance, and originality of much of the Soviet research. The current article attempts to correct this situation by providing a comprehensive, yet nontechnical, overview of Soviet MOMP methods. Using a taxonomy similar to ones that have been applied to Western MOMP techniques, the article categorizes the Soviet methods based on when they involve a decision maker in the solution processa priori, progressively, a posteriori, or neverand what kind of information the decision maker provides. In all, 17 methods are analyzed with particular attention given to their distinctive features and to the issues of computational feasibility and burden on the decision maker. The article concludes with observations on the overall character of Soviet MOMP research, comparing the general directions in Soviet and Western research.

## 6. On Manufacturing/Marketing Incentives
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
Stereotypically, marketing is mainly concerned about satisfying customers and manufacturing is mainly interested in factory efficiency. Using the principal-agent (agency) paradigm, which assumes that the marketing and manufacturing managers of the firm will act in their self-interest, we seek incentive plans that will induce those managers to act so that the owner of the firm can attain as much as possible of the residual returns. One optimal incentive plan can be interpreted as follows: The owner subcontracts to pay the manufacturing manager a fixed rate for all capacity he delivers. Each marketing manager receives all of the returns from his product. In turn, all managers pay a fixed fee to the owner. Under this plan, the marketing managers will often complain about the stock level decisions, even though these levels are announced in advance. Under a revised plan, the owner can eliminate such complaints by delegating the stocking decisions to the respective marketing managers, without any loss. This plan is interpreted as requiring the owner to make a futures market for manufacturing capacity, paying the manufacturing manager the expected marginal value for each unit of capacity delivered, receiving the realized marginal value from the marketing managers, and losing money on average in the process.

## 7. Bootstrapped Insights into Empirical Applications of Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):

- Rulon D. Pope
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
Bootstrapping, a very versatile statistical technique, significantly amplifies the understanding and success of empirical applications of stochastic dominance. Its ability to calculate the standard deviations of order statistics reveals the uncertainty of the critical estimates of the tails of cumulative density functions. Understanding this uncertainty reveals why a wide variety of tail shapes all cause a notable loss in power for stochastic dominance tests. Simulations show that the smoothing inherent in bootstrapping can significantly increase the power of the tests when dominance exists in the population.

## 8. NoteAn Improved Discrete Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Allocating Resources Among Interdependent Projects
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Carraway
- Robert L. Schmidt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
Nemhauser and Ullmann (1969) proposed a discrete dynamic programming (DP) approach for several variations of the basic capital allocation model, including one in which the returns and resource consumption of projects are interdependent. For this case, we augment their DP approach with a branch-and-bound strategy as suggested in Morin and Marsten (1976). Computational results demonstrate that this enhancement significantly reduces required computation time and effectively removes any limit on the number of nonzero interaction terms allowed. We also demonstrate that our approach compares favorably to an alternative implicit enumeration approach proposed by Hansen (1972).

## 9. Note: An Improvement to the Dynamic Cycle Lengths Heuristic for Scheduling the Multi-Item, Single-Machine
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
A heuristic scheduling policy for multi-item, single-machine scheduling systems facing stochastic, time-varying demands was previously introduced by Leachman and Gascon. In this technical note we provide an improvement to the calculations of the policy. Simulation tests of the revised version of the policy indicate that the improvements maintain or enhance customer service while reducing total inventory and setup costs on the order of 17%.

## 10. Paradox or At Least Variance Found: A Comment on Mean-Variance Approaches to Risk-Return Relationships in Strategy: Paradox Lost
### Author(s):
- Philip Bromiley
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1991
### Abstract:
In general, the problem is that the computed mean-variance relationship for a period of time cannot be identified in distinction to the effects of shifts in the relationship over timewithout additional information or assumptions. Thus, using a mean-variance approach to risk-return relationships means that statements about the nature of the mean-variance association cannot be confirmed in a nontrivial fashion within the empirical system nor generalized to any other time periodincluding subperiods.
