## 1. Interactive Process Quality Improvement
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
An ongoing production process produces defective parts at random intervals. Each defective part provides a learning opportunity which the decision maker may use to improve the process by investing resources to identify and remove the causes of the defective. For various cost criteria, it is optimal to invest in learning until the probability of producing a defective becomes sufficiently small. This policy has economic interpretations in terms of marginal benefits. In addition, the optimal policy for expected discounted present cost has an interpretation in terms of tradeoffs between cost of failure and cost of prevention. The shape of the tradeoff curve gives insight into the controversy between the traditional and zero defects views towards cost of quality.

## 2. Integrating Distribution Strategy and Tactics: A Model and an Application
### Author(s):
- V. Kasturi Rangan

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
Designing distribution systems requires two decisions, one strategic (i.e., the number of levels between the producer and the customer) and the other tactical (i.e., channel management policies such as trade discounts and rebates). While the modeling literature focuses on one or the other, evidence from the field indicates that the two decisions are in fact interactive. In this paper, we develop and then apply an integrated model that solves the strategic issue of channel levels and the tactical issue of price rebates simultaneously.

## 3. Informational Dynamics of Censored Observations
### Author(s):
- David J. Braden
- Marshall Freimer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
The analysis of stochastic models is often greatly complicated if there are censored observations of the random variables. This paper characterizes families of distributions which help keep tractable the analysis of such models. Our primary motivation is to provide guidance to practitioners in the selection of distributions: If a modeler feels that no member of the families we characterize is a reasonable approximation, then he will almost surely encounter serious analytic and computational problems if his data include censored observations.

## 4. Business Risk and Return: A Test of Simultaneous Relationships
### Author(s):
- Benjamin M. Oviatt
- Alan D. Bauerschmidt
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
Bowman (1980) found an unexpected and paradoxical negative relationship between risk and return in many firms, and, for about a decade, various researchers have attempted to explain the paradox. This article summarizes some of those explanations, and shows that industry conditions and business strategies are likely to influence both risk and return. The relationships are depicted in a simultaneous model where business return, risk, and debt are endogenously determined.

## 5. Strong Consistency and Other Properties of the Spectral Variance Estimator
### Author(s):
- Halim Damerdji
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
Consistent estimation of the variance parameter of a stochastic process allows construction, under certain conditions, of a confidence interval for the mean of the process. If the variance estimator is strongly consistent, fixed-width confidence interval construction is valid for large samples. It has long been known that the spectral variance estimator of steady-state simulation output analysis is consistent in the mean-square sense. Here, we provide strong consistency of this estimator, thereby justifying fixed-width confidence interval construction for the spectral method. A characterization of spectral density function estimators is also introduced. This characterization provides insight into the relation between spectral methods and overlapping batch means-type variance estimators. Finally, some of the mathematical conditions provide qualitative insight into the relation between the process correlation and certain parameters of spectral methods.

## 6. Sufficient Working Subsets for the Tour Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Fred F. Easton
- Donald F. Rossin
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
Mathematical programs to schedule service employees at minimum cost represent each feasible schedule, or tour, with an integer variable. In some service organizations, policies governing employee scheduling practices may permit millions of different tours. A common heuristic strategy is to reformulate the problem from a small working subset of the feasible tours. Solution quality depends on the number and types of schedules included in the model.

## 7. Competitive Strategies for Two Firms with Asymmetric Production Cost Structures
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
- Richard Steinberg
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
We model joint production-marketing strategies for two firms with asymmetric production cost structures in competition. The first firm, called the Production-smoother, faces a convex production cost and a linear inventory holding cost. The second firm, called the Order-taker, faces a linear production cost and holds no inventory. Each firm is assumed to vary continuously over time both its production rate and its price in view of an unstable surge pattern of demand. The underlying theoretical motivation is to investigate the temporal nature of the equilibrium policies of two competing firms, one operating at or near capacity (the Production-smoother), and one operating significantly below capacity (the Order-taker).

## 8. Uncertain Search: A Model of Search Among Technologies of Uncertain Values
### Author(s):
- Steven A. Lippman
- Kevin F. McCardle
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
In the standard search problem there is an infinite pool of items whose distribution of values is known. A decision maker draws an item from the pool, observes its value, and decides whether to keep it or to draw another item. He can keep only one item, and he seeks the item with the largest value. In the standard uncertainty resolution problem there is only one item, and the value of that item remains uncertain even after it is drawn. The decision maker sequentially collects observations on the value of the item and decides whether to keep the item, discard the item, or take another observation. Uncertain search marries the sequential drawing from a pool of items from the search literature with the unknown value of a drawn item from the uncertainty resolution literature. Presented in the context of technology adoption, it considers drawing from a pool of new technologies whose values remain unknown even after being drawn. The decision maker sequentially purchases information in order to Bayesianly update the prior distribution of the technology's value. After each observation, the decision maker either adopts the technology (and hence quits searching), takes another costly observation, rejects the technology and quits searching, or rejects the technology and draws the next technology from the pool for observation. The solution to this uncertain search problem is surprisingly simple: solve the version of the uncertainty resolution problem in which the return to rejecting the technology is replaced by an exit value. Then use successive approximation to find a fixed point: an exit value that equals the expected value of the uncertainty resolution problem.

## 10. Comments on One-Warehouse Multiple Retailer Systems with Vehicle Routing Costs
### Author(s):
- Randolph W. Hall
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1991
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Anily and Federgruen developed a methodology for assigning retailers to vehicle tours, with the objective of minimizing long-run average transportation and inventory costs. This comment demonstrates that coordinating deliveries among tours can reduce cost over their solution.

### Abstract:
Swanson et al.'s comment, Illusive Effects on the Diffusion of an Innovation: A Comment, (Swanson et al. 1991, this issue) contains two major criticisms of our paper (Nilakanta and Scamell 1990), Effects of Information Sources and Communication Channels on Diffusion of Innovation in a Data Base Development Environment: (1) the significance and interpretations of the results and (2) the legitimacy of certain measures that appear in the questionnaire contained in the appendix (pp. 3438). The purpose of this comment is to address these criticisms.
