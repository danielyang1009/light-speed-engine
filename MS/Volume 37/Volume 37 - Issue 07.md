## 1. Dispersive Equity and Social Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
Dispersive equity is concerned with the impact of life-threatening risks from alternative policy decisions on homogeneous groups in a population. It is not addressed to the disutility of various numbers of fatalities that might occur, but rather to how fatalities are distributed over the groups. Although dispersive equity has long been recognized as an important component of some policy decisions, it has received little formal treatment within the matrix of salient factors for such decisions. Our purpose is to advance its formal development.

## 2. Decision Making Over Time and Under Uncertainty: A Common Approach
### Author(s):
- Drazen Prelec
- George Loewenstein
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
This paper considers a number of parallels between risky and intertemporal choice. We begin by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the behavioral violations of the respective normative theories for the two domains (i.e., expected utility and discounted utility models). We argue that such violations (or preference reversals) are broadly consistent with three propositions about the weight that an attribute receives in both types of multiattribute choice. Specifically, it appears that: (1) if we add a constant to all values of an attribute, then that attribute becomes less important; (2) if we proportionately increase all values of an attribute, or if we change the sign of an attribute, from positive to negative, then that attribute becomes more important. The generality of these propositions, as well as the constraints they would impose on separable representations of multiattribute preferences, is discussed.

## 3. Robust Capacity Planning Under Uncertainty

### Abstract:
The existence of uncertainty influences the investment, production and pricing decision of firms. Therefore, capacity expansion models need to take into account uncertainty. This uncertainty, may arise because of errors in the specification, statistical estimation of relationships and in the assumptions of exogenous variables. One such example is demand uncertainty. In this paper, a cautious capacity planning approach is described for solving problems in which robustness to likely errors is needed. The aim is to cast the problem in a deterministic framework and thereby avoid the complexities inherent in nonlinear stochastic formulations. We adopt a robust approach and minimize an augmented objective function that penalises the sensitivity of the objective function to various types of uncertainty. The robust or sensitivity approach is compared with Friedenfelds' equivalent deterministic demand method. Using numerical results from a large nonlinear programming capacity planning model, it is shown that as caution against demand uncertainty increases, the variance of the total objective function (profit) decreases. The cost of such robustness is a deterioration in the deterministic risky performance. This method is also applied to an industry simulation model in order to assess the effect of uncertainty in market demand on optimal capacity expansion and capacity utilisation.

## 4. Some Extensions of the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):

- Leo G. Kroon

- Luk N. Van Wassenhove
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
In this paper the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem (DLSP) is considered. DLSP relates to capacitated lotsizing as well as to job scheduling problems and is concerned with determining a feasible production schedule with minimal total costs in a single-stage manufacturing process. This involves the sequencing and sizing of production lots for a number of different items over a discrete and finite planning horizon. Feasibility of production schedules is subject to production quantities being within bounds set by capacity.

## 5. Random Review Production/Inventory Systems with Compound Poisson Demands and Arbitrary Processing Times
### Author(s):
- Mandyam M. Srinivasan
- Hyo-Seong Lee
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
A production/inventory system is considered in which a single production facility produces items of a given type. The demand for the item is assumed to arrive according to a compound Poisson process. The time required to produce an item is assumed to follow an arbitrary distribution. An (s, S) policy is considered in which production stops at the instant that the inventory level is raised to S and production resumes at an inspection point when the inventory level is observed to have dropped to or below s for the first time. The time interval between two successive inspection points during a nonproduction period is a random variable which follows an arbitrary distribution.

## 6. Due-Date Setting and Priority Sequencing in a Multiclass M/G/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- Lawrence M. Wein
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
The problem of simultaneous due-date setting and priority sequencing is analyzed in the setting of a multiclass M/G/1 queueing system. The objective is to minimize the weighted average due-date lead time (due-date minus arrival date) of jobs subject to a constraint on either the fraction of tardy jobs or the average job tardiness. Several parametric and nonparametric due-date setting policies are proposed that depend on the class of arriving job, the state of the queueing system at the time of the job's arrival, and the sequencing policy (the weighted shortest expected processing time rule) that is used. In a simulation experiment performed on a two-class M/M/1 system, these policies outperformed traditional due-date setting policies, and due-date setting had a larger impact on performance than priority sequencing.

## 7. Optimal Update Policies for Distributed Materialized Views
### Author(s):
- Arie Segev
- Weiping Fang
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
In this paper we present an analysis of the problem of determining optimal policies for updating distributed materialized views. We demonstrate the general application of materialized views, and define the concept of materialized view currency and allow a query to specify its currency requirement. We also allow a materialized view to be updated from either a base relation or another materialized view. This flexibility provides an opportunity for further reduction in the cost of maintaining distributed materialized views. We model the problem of optimal update policies to capture currency and policy constraints, replicated data, and various view update policies. The optimization incorporates a minimum-cost objective function as well as user's response time constraints.

## 8. A Methodology for Collective Evaluation and Selection of Industrial R&D Projects
### Author(s):
- Muhittin Oral
- Ossama Kettani
- Pascal Lang
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating and selecting R&D projects in a collective decision setting, especially useful at sectorial and national levels. It consists of two major phases: Evaluation and Selection. The evaluation process repeatedly uses mathematical programming models to determine the relative values of a given R&D project from the viewpoint of the other R&D projects. The selection process of R&D projects is based on these relative values and is done through a model-based outranking method.

## 9. Nonparametric Estimation of the Cumulative Intensity Function for a Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process
### Author(s):
- Lawrence M. Leemis
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
A nonparametric technique for estimating the cumulative intensity function of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process from one or more realizations is developed. This technique does not require any arbitrary parameters from the modeler, and the estimated cumulative intensity function can be used to generate a point process for Monte Carlo simulation by inversion. Three examples are given.

## 10. NoteSequencing JIT Mixed-Model Assembly Lines
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1991
### Abstract:
We provide a new formulation and solution procedure to sequence a mixed model just-in-time (JIT) assembly system. Mixed model JIT assembly systems are a fundamental part of the well-known Toyota Production System. The underlying idea in sequencing these systems is to maintain a constant usage rate of all parts on the line. We give a polynomial algorithm to determine the optimal sequence for an objective function that is mathematically different, but intuitively similar to the objective functions of previous researchers. Furthermore, a computational study indicates that the new algorithm is robust in that its sequences are as good as those generated by other algorithms when evaluated with respect to traditional objectives, but are found 200 times faster.
