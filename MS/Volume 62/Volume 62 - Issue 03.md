## 2. Habits of Virtue: Creating Norms of Cooperation and Defection in the Laboratory

### Abstract:
What explains variability in norms of cooperation across organizations and cultures? One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner’s dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games. Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general. Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced in other settings.

## 3. Incomplete-Information Models of Guilt Aversion in the Trust Game

### Abstract:
In the theory of psychological games it is assumed that players’ preferences on material consequences depend on endogenous beliefs. Most of the applications of this theoretical framework assume that the psychological utility functions representing such preferences are common knowledge. However, this is often unrealistic. In particular, it cannot be true in experimental games where players are subjects drawn at random from a population. Therefore, an incomplete-information methodology is needed. We take a first step in this direction, focusing on guilt aversion in the Trust Game. In our models, agents have heterogeneous belief hierarchies. We characterize equilibria where trust occurs with positive probability. Our analysis illustrates the incomplete-information approach to psychological games and can help to organize experimental results in the Trust Game.

## 4. The Impact of Negatively Reciprocal Inclinations on Worker Behavior: Evidence from a Retrenchment of Pension Rights

### Published:

### Abstract:
We document that the strength of negatively reciprocal inclinations affects workers’ reaction to unfair treatment. We exploit unique matched survey and administrative data on male public sector employees in the Netherlands and compare the job motivation of employees born in 1950, who faced a substantial retrenchment of their pension rights resulting from a pension reform in 2006, to that of slightly older employees who remained entitled to more generous pension benefits. Job motivation is significantly lower among negatively reciprocal employees who were affected by the reform. The adverse effect on job motivation is stronger for negative reciprocal employees born very shortly after the cutoff date of January 1, 1950, as well as for those with many unaffected colleagues, who perceive the policy change as being more unfair. The treatment effect is stronger among workers who are more likely to hold their employer accountable for the drop in their pension rights.

## 5. Sell-Side Debt Analysts and Debt Market Efficiency

### Published:
- 15 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
We explore sell-side debt analysts’ contributions to the efficiency of securities markets. We document that debt returns lag equity returns less when debt research coverage exists, which is consistent with debt analysts facilitating the process by which available information is impounded in debt prices. The effect of debt research on the debt market’s lag is incremental to, but comparable in magnitude to, hedge fund ownership’s effect. No such effect exists for credit rating agencies. We also find that the dissemination of debt reports has an immediate effect on return volatility in both markets, which is consistent with debt analysts providing new information to securities markets. Increased return covariation suggests that this information impacts the pricing of debt and equity in the same direction. A large percentage of debt reports do not induce any immediate debt market return reaction but do induce an equity return reaction, which is consistent with new information being provided despite the absence of a debt market reaction. Finally, there is a systematic variation in the debt market’s trading and return reactions to debt research. Timely reports and those by high-reputation brokers induce a quicker trading response, thus enhancing liquidity, whereas only timely reports induce a greater return response. This study illuminates the institutional underpinnings of debt market efficiency, and it has important implications for information content tests in the debt market, where trading is limited.

## 6. Conflict Resolution, Public Goods, and Patent Thickets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
Postgrant validity challenges at patent offices rely on the private initiative of third parties to correct mistakes made by patent offices. We hypothesize that incentives to bring postgrant validity challenges are reduced when many firms benefit from revocation of a patent and when firms are caught up in patent thickets. Using data on opposition to patents at the European Patent Office we show that opposition decreases in fields in which many others profit from patent revocations. Moreover, in fields with a large number of mutually blocking patents, the incidence of opposition is sharply reduced, particularly among large firms and firms that are caught up directly in patent thickets. These findings indicate that postgrant patent review may not constitute an effective correction device for erroneous patent grants in technologies affected by either patent thickets or highly dispersed patent ownership.

## 7. Under One Roof: A Study of Simultaneously Managed Hedge Funds and Funds of Hedge Funds
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
We examine the simultaneous management of hedge funds and funds of hedge funds. Hedge fund firms can choose to simultaneously offer a fund of hedge funds. Similarly, fund of hedge funds firms can simultaneously offer a hedge fund. We find that although superior past performance and larger size drive the decision to become simultaneous for hedge fund firms, past flows drive the decision for fund of hedge funds firms. The effects of simultaneity are also different. When hedge fund firms start funds of hedge funds, we find evidence of value creation, driven by better management of economies of scale and cross learning. In contrast, fund of hedge funds firms starting hedge funds destroy value due to expansion beyond core competencies and agency problems. We find that firms learn about their competencies in the two business lines and discontinue underperforming simultaneity arrangements to focus on the business where they perform better.

## 8. Volatility Risks and Growth Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
We propose to measure growth opportunities by firms’ exposure to idiosyncratic volatility news. Theoretically, we show that the value of a growth option increases in idiosyncratic volatility but its response to volatility of aggregate shocks can be either positive or negative depending on option moneyness. Empirically, we show that price sensitivity to variation in idiosyncratic volatility carries significant information about firms’ future investment and growth even after controlling for conventional proxies of growth options such as book-to-market and other relevant firm characteristics. Consistent with our theoretical arguments, we also find that firm’ exposure to aggregate volatility, while priced, does not help predict their future growth. Option-intensive firms identified using our idiosyncratic volatility-based measure earn a lower premium than do firms that rely more heavily on assets in place.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
Recent models and the popular press suggest that large groups of hedge funds follow similar strategies resulting in crowded equity positions that destabilize markets. Inconsistent with this assertion, we find that hedge fund equity portfolios are remarkably independent. Moreover, when hedge funds do buy and sell the same stocks, their demand shocks are, on average, positively related to subsequent raw and risk-adjusted returns. Even in periods of extreme market stress, we find no evidence that hedge fund demand shocks are inversely related to subsequent returns. Our results have important implications for the ongoing debate regarding hedge fund regulation.

## 10. Project Characteristics, Incentives, and Team Production

### Published:
- 5 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
We develop a model to show how agency conflicts, free-rider effects, and monitoring costs interact to affect optimal team size and workers’ incentive contracts. Team size increases with project risk, decreases with profitability, and decreases with monitoring costs as a proportion of output. Our predictions are consistent with empirical evidence that firm-specific risk has increased over time, average corporate earnings have declined, and firms’ organizational structures have also flattened. The predicted effects of monitoring costs on team size are supported by evidence that improvements in information technology likely to lower monitoring costs lead to larger teams. Further, firms with relatively more intangible assets, where monitoring costs are likely to be higher, are smaller. Optimal incentive intensities decrease with risk and increase with profitability. The endogenous determination of team size accentuates the positive effects of a decline in risk and an increase in profitability on incentives.

### Published:
- 31 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
Do store brands aid store loyalty by enhancing store differentiation or merely draw price-sensitive customers with little or no store loyalty? This paper seeks to answer this question by empirically investigating the relationship between store brand loyalty and store loyalty. First, we find a robust, monotonic, positive relationship between store brand loyalty and store loyalty by using multiple loyalty metrics and data from multiple retailers and by controlling for alternative factors that can influence store loyalty. Second, we take advantage of a natural experiment involving a store closure and find that the attrition in chain loyalty is lower for households with greater store brand loyalty prior to store closure. Together, our results are consistent with evidence for the store differentiation role of store brands.

## 12. The Impact of Walmart Supercenter Conversion on Consumer Shopping Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 May 2015
### Abstract:
This paper presents an empirical study of the impact of Walmart supercenter conversion on consumer shopping behavior. By using a difference-in-difference estimator, we find that Walmart gains 41% in weekly revenue from the conversion. Decomposing the revenue gains into components attributable to store visits and per-visit expenditures, we find that the majority of these gains were due to larger expenditures, with a much smaller impact from store visits. By contrast, among competing retailers, grocery stores experience the most significant loss (20% weekly revenue) mostly from fewer store visits, with a much smaller impact attributable to per-visit expenditure. Taken together, these findings show that consumers may benefit from reduced shopping costs by making fewer overall trips and increasing their Walmart basket sizes. In addition, we find that overall revenue gains for Walmart from conversion outweigh the small cannibalization loss at the existing Walmart supercenters located farther away. Finally, from category-level analyses, we find evidence of increases in category-level spending in preexisting categories in the converted supercenter. However, we also find that positive demand externality is more pronounced in food categories, mainly as a result of increased purchase incidence. We discuss the implications of our findings for academics and retail managers.

## 13. The Impact of Combining Conformance and Experiential Quality on Hospitals’ Readmissions and Cost Performance

### Abstract:
To investigate the opportunity for hospitals to achieve better care at lower cost, we examine two key process quality measures, conformance quality and experiential quality, and two measures of performance, readmission rate and cost per discharge. Conformance quality represents a hospital’s level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care, whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between hospital’s caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from 3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However, conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions–costs trade-off is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers’ ability to respond to patient’s explicit needs, whereas communication-focused EQ measures caregivers’ ability to engage in meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission rates. Moreover, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity. Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results in reduced readmission rates. However, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting that these dimensions might compete for resources. Taken together, our results suggest that hospital administrators can mitigate the trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs by prioritizing communication-focused EQ over response-focused EQ.

## 14. Cultivating Disaster Donors Using Data Analytics
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
Nonprofit organizations use direct-mail marketing to cultivate one-time donors and convert them into recurring contributors. Cultivated donors generate much more revenue than new donors, but also lapse with time, making it important to steadily draw in new cultivations. The direct-mail budget is limited, but better-designed mailings can improve success rates without increasing costs. We propose an empirical model to analyze the effectiveness of several design approaches used in practice, based on a massive data set covering 8.6 million direct-mail communications with donors to the American Red Cross during 2009–2011. We find evidence that mailed appeals are more effective when they emphasize disaster preparedness and training efforts over post-disaster cleanup. Including small cards that affirm donors’ identity as Red Cross supporters is an effective strategy, whereas including gift items such as address labels is not. Finally, very recent acquisitions are more likely to respond to appeals that ask them to contribute an amount similar to their most recent donation, but this approach has an adverse effect on donors with a longer history. We show via simulation that a simple design strategy based on these insights has potential to improve success rates from 5.4% to 8.1%.

## 15. Liking and Following and the Newsvendor: Operations and Marketing Policies Under Social Influence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
We consider a monopolistic firm selling two substitutable products to a stream of sequential arrivals whose purchase decisions can be influenced by earlier purchases. Before demand realizes, the firm faces a newsvendor problem for the two products with economies of scale in production for each. When consumers are responsive to others’ decisions, social influence amplifies demand uncertainty, leading to a lower profit for the firm. We propose three solutions for the firm to better cope with or even benefit from social influence: influencer recruitment and a reduced product assortment either before demand realization (ex ante) or under production postponement (ex post). First, the firm can offer promotional incentives to recruit consumers as influencers. We reveal an operational benefit of influencer marketing that a very small fraction of such influencers is sufficient to diminish sales’ unpredictability. Second, as the potential substitutability between products increases due to social influence, the firm may leverage the increased substitutability and enjoy lower cost in production by reducing product assortment before demand realization. Last, under production postponement, the firm can take advantage of the way that social influence results in demand herding and reduce product varieties by reacting to preorder information.

## 16. Electricity Trading and Negative Prices: Storage vs. Disposal
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
Electricity cannot yet be stored on a large scale, but technological advances leading to cheaper and more efficient industrial batteries make grid-level storage of electricity surpluses a natural choice. Because electricity prices can be negative, it is unclear how the presence of negative prices might affect the storage policy structure known to be optimal when prices are only nonnegative, or even how important it is to consider negative prices when managing an industrial battery. For fast storage (a storage facility that can both be fully emptied and filled up in one decision period), we show analytically that negative prices can substantially alter the optimal storage policy structure, e.g., all else being equal, it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage facility and fill up an almost full one. For more typical slow grid-level electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring negative prices could result in a considerable loss of value when negative prices occur more than 5% of the time. Negative prices raise another possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e.g., using load banks. We find that the value of such a disposal strategy is substantial, e.g., about $118 per kilowatt-year when negative prices occur 10% of the time, but smaller than that of the storage strategy, e.g., about $391 per kilowatt-year using a typical battery. However, devices for disposal are much cheaper than those for storage. Our results thus have ramifications for merchants as well as policy makers.

## 17. On Socially Optimal Queue Length
### Author(s):
- Chia-Li Wang
### Published:
- 24 Apr 2015
### Abstract:
Suppose customers arrive at an observable queueing system for service with a utility function of reward and waiting cost. The self- (customer) decision is whether to queue or balk, and the social (system administrator) goal is to maximize the profit of the whole system. Whereas the self-optimal policy is relatively easy to obtain, the socially optimal policy, which is of more practical importance, often requires a tedious and ad hoc analysis as a result of external effects. We will introduce a simple and general approach to determine the optimal admission policy. The main idea of this approach is to consider a special rule that admits an extra customer who is served only by the surplus capacity and bears all the increased waiting time and thus incurs no external cost. The approach applies in principle to queues with exponential service. In fact, for such queues, a marginal analysis based on this rule will explore the properties of the optimal social policy and lead to a general procedure for deriving the optimal threshold.
