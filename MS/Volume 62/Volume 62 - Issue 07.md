## 2. Constituencies and Legislation: The Fight Over the McFadden Act of 1927
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The McFadden Act of 1927 was one of the most hotly contested pieces of legislation in U.S. banking history, and its influence was felt over half a century later. This paper studies the congressional voting behavior surrounding the act’s passage. We find that congressmen in districts in which landholdings were concentrated and credit was costlier were significantly more likely to oppose the act. The evidence suggests that whereas the law and the overall regulatory structure can shape the financial system far into the future, they themselves are likely to be shaped by elites, even in countries with benign political institutions.

## 3. Service Competition and Product Quality in the U.S. Automobile Industry

### Abstract:
We study the impact of service attributes (warranty length, after-sales service quality) on consumer demand in the U.S. automobile industry, examining the presence of complementarities/substitution between service attributes and product quality. Our results estimate a median willingness to pay for one year of a warranty of approximately $850, which is equivalent to 3.1% of the median vehicle price in our sample. We find that, for a car with median characteristics, the effect on consumer utility of a 1% price decrease is equivalent, all else being equal, to increasing product quality by 2.2%, and is in turn equivalent to increasing the warranty length by 8%. Our results also indicate that service attributes play a compensatory role with respect to product quality; i.e., the impact of warranty length and service quality on demand increases when product quality decreases. Conversely, both service metrics are complementary with respect to demand; i.e., the better the service quality, the higher the marginal effect of longer warranties. Our results thus imply that, in our period of analysis, warranties played a more important role for American firms than for foreign firms, consistent with the fact that American manufacturers exhibited lower product quality and higher service quality than non-American firms.

## 4. Do Nonexecutive Employees Have Valuable Information? Evidence from Employee Stock Purchase Plans
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
Using novel data on employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), we show that aggregate purchases of company stock by lower-level employees predict future stock returns. Firms in the top quartile of ESPP purchases outperform those in the bottom quartile by 10% in the year after purchase. The relation between ESPP purchases and future stock returns is stronger for firms with high information asymmetry. Furthermore, we find that high ESPP purchases are associated with a lower likelihood of breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases, as well as higher future sales growth and more innovation. These findings support the hypothesis that lower-level employees have information about future firm performance. We examine and reject a number of alternative explanations. Our results have implications for firms using employees as a source of capital, accounting issues related to expensing of equity-based compensation, and disclosure policy.

## 5. Provision of Incentives for Information Acquisition: Forecast-Based Contracts vs. Menus of Linear Contracts
### Author(s):

- 22 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
In the producer–seller relationship, the seller, besides his role of selling, is often in an ideal position to gather useful market information for the producer’s operations planning. Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise. These findings can enrich the understanding of these two contract forms and are useful for sales and operations planning.

## 6. The Exact Distribution of the Hansen–Jagannathan Bound
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
Under the assumption of multivariate normality of asset returns, this paper presents a geometric interpretation and the finite-sample distributions of the sample Hansen–Jagannathan bounds on the variance of admissible stochastic discount factors, with and without the nonnegativity constraint on the stochastic discount factors. In addition, since the sample Hansen–Jagannathan bounds can be very volatile, we propose a simple method to construct confidence intervals for the population Hansen–Jagannathan bounds. Finally, we show that the analytical results in the paper are robust to departures from the normality assumption.

### Abstract:
We study how leader compensation affects public goods provision. We report from a lab experiment with four treatments, where the base treatment was a standard public goods game with simultaneous contribution decisions, and the three other treatments allowed participants to volunteer to be the leader in their group and make their contribution before the others. In the three leader treatments, we manipulated the level of compensation given to the leader. Our main finding is that a moderate compensation to the leader is beneficial; it increases the average contribution relative to both a situation where the leader is not compensated and a situation without a leader. A further increase in the leader compensation, however, is detrimental to public goods provision; it attracts more free riders and creates a social crowding-out effect. Finally, we report from a survey showing that the social crowding-out effect is also present in the population at large. We argue that the main findings of the paper are important in many real-life settings where we would like to use economic incentives to encourage people to lead by example.

### Published:
- 2 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
We report on two experiments challenging the common assumption that events with objective probabilities constitute a unique source of uncertainty. We find that, similar to the domain of ambiguity, the domain of risk is rich in the sense that behavior is systematically different when subjects face risky bets based on simple or more complex events. Furthermore, we find a tight association between attitudes toward complex risky bets and attitudes toward both ambiguity and compound lotteries. These results raise questions about the characterization of ambiguity aversion and the modeling of decisions under uncertainty.

## 9. Corporate Science, Innovation, and Firm Value
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
Many firms actively disclose research findings in scientific peer-reviewed journals. The literature highlights several potential benefits of such scientific boundary-spanning activities, including privileged access to academic information networks. However, scientific disclosure may lead to unintended knowledge spillovers. It remains unclear whether active engagement in science leads to higher returns. This paper investigates the impact of scientific activities on the firm’s market value, using accounting data for U.S. firms and matched patent and scientific publication data. We find evidence for the positive impact of scientific publications on a firm’s market value beyond the effects of research and development, patent stocks, and patent quality, and also document heterogeneity with respect to this impact between different industrial sectors.

## 10. The Impact of Stakeholder Orientation on Innovation: Evidence from a Natural Experiment
### Author(s):
- Caroline Flammer
- Aleksandra Kacperczyk
### Published:
- 12 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
In this study, we assess the causal impact of stakeholder orientation on innovation. To obtain exogenous variation in stakeholder orientation, we exploit the enactment of state-level constituency statutes, which allow directors to consider stakeholders’ interests when making business decisions. Using a difference-in-differences methodology, we find that the enactment of constituency statutes leads to a significant increase in the number of patents and citations per patent. We further argue and provide evidence suggesting that stakeholder orientation sparks innovation by encouraging experimentation and enhancing employees’ innovative productivity. Finally, we find that the positive effect of stakeholder orientation on innovation is larger in consumer-focused and less eco-friendly industries.

## 11. Hit or Miss: What Leads Experts to Take Advice for Long-Term Judgments?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
Managers and policy makers frequently face crucial strategic decisions that inevitably rely on judgments about relevant future events. These judgments are often characterized by very high uncertainty and the absence of experience from previous good or bad judgments. Judgments of other experts are oftentimes an important—sometimes the only—source of additional information to reduce uncertainty and improve judgment accuracy. However, in many practical situations, decision makers have very limited means to evaluate the quality of such “advice” from other experts and could tend to ignore this valid source of information. In this paper, we study what leads decision makers to take advice from an expert panel when judging the probability of far-future events with high economic impact. Our analysis is based on a unique data set that comprises more than 15,000 advice-taking decisions made by almost 1,000 experts from different industries. We find that decision makers have a strong tendency to ignore advice, which pronounces even further when conflicts in terms of beliefs, past experiences, or desires arise.

## 12. Incentive Problems in Performance-Based Online Advertising Pricing: Cost per Click vs. Cost per Action
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
The multibillion-dollar online advertising industry continues to debate whether to use the cost per click (CPC) or cost per action (CPA) pricing model as an industry standard. This paper applies the economic framework of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers’ risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing models. We further consider which pricing model offers greater social welfare.

## 13. The Effects of Age and Expertise on Product Evaluations: Does the Type of Information Matter?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
To better understand two large consumer segments, the boomers and the echo-boomers, we examine whether and why experts and novices from these two segments rely on attribute versus benefit information in product evaluations. In four studies, we show that expertise affects younger consumers, such that younger novices evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature benefit information, whereas younger experts evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature attribute information. However, both older novices and experts evaluate products described with benefit information more favorably than those described with attribute information. We further show that differences in the perceived diagnosticity of different types of information mediate the effects of expertise and age on product evaluations. We theorize that age differences in perceived diagnosticity occur because older and younger consumers spontaneously construe information in different ways. Therefore, age differences in the effect of expertise on evaluations should disappear when construal levels are controlled. Consistent with our hypotheses, we demonstrate that when primed to construe information at concrete levels, older consumers behave just like younger consumers—older experts formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with attribute information, but older novices formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with benefit information. When younger consumers are primed to construe information at abstract levels, they prefer products described with benefit information regardless of expertise, just like older consumers. We discuss the implications of our results for both researchers and practitioners.

## 14. Cumulative Growth in User-Generated Content Production: Evidence from Wikipedia
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
Open content production platforms typically allow users to gradually create content and react to previous contributions. Using detailed edit-level data across a large number of Wikipedia articles, we investigate how past edits shape current editing activity. We find that cumulative past contributions, embodied by the current article length, lead to significantly more editing activity, while controlling for a host of factors such as popularity of the topic and platform-level growth trends. The magnitude of the effect is large; content growth over an eight-year period would have been 45% lower in its absence. Our findings suggest that other open content production environments are likely to also benefit from similar cumulative growth effects. In the presence of such effects, managerial interventions that increase content are amplified because they trigger further contributions.

## 15. Constrained Resource Assignments: Fast Algorithms and Applications in Wireless Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
Resource assignment problems occur in a vast variety of applications, from scheduling problems over image recognition to communication networks. Often these problems can be modeled by a maximum weight matching problem in (bipartite) graphs or generalizations thereof, and efficient and practical algorithms are known for these problems. Although in some of the applications an assignment of the resources may be needed only once, in many of these applications, the assignment has to be computed more often for different scenarios. In that case it is often essential that the assignments can be computed very fast. Moreover, implementing different assignments in different scenarios may come with a certain cost for the reconfiguration of the system. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining optimal assignments sequentially over a given time horizon, where consecutive assignments are coupled by constraints that control the cost of reconfiguration. We develop fast approximation and online algorithms for this problem with provable approximation guarantees and competitive ratios. Moreover, we present an extensive computational study about the applicability of our model and our algorithms in the context of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks, finding a significant performance improvement for the total bandwidth of the system using our algorithms. For this application (the downlink of an OFDMA wireless cell) , the run time of matching algorithms is extremely important, having an acceptable range of a few milliseconds only. For the considered realistic instances, our algorithms perform extremely well: the solution quality is, on average, within a factor of 0.8–0.9 of optimal off-line solutions, and the running times are at most 5 ms per phase even in the worst case. Thus, our algorithms are well suited to be applied in the context of OFDMA systems.

## 16. Robust Growth-Optimal Portfolios

### Published:
- 13 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
The growth-optimal portfolio is designed to have maximum expected log return over the next rebalancing period. Thus, it can be computed with relative ease by solving a static optimization problem. The growth-optimal portfolio has sparked fascination among finance professionals and researchers because it can be shown to outperform any other portfolio with probability 1 in the long run. In the short run, however, it is notoriously volatile. Moreover, its computation requires precise knowledge of the asset return distribution, which is not directly observable but must be inferred from sparse data. By using methods from distributionally robust optimization, we design fixed-mix strategies that offer similar performance guarantees as the growth-optimal portfolio but for a finite investment horizon and for a whole family of distributions that share the same first- and second-order moments. We demonstrate that the resulting robust growth-optimal portfolios can be computed efficiently by solving a tractable conic program whose size is independent of the length of the investment horizon. Simulated and empirical backtests show that the robust growth-optimal portfolios are competitive with the classical growth-optimal portfolio across most realistic investment horizons and for an overwhelming majority of contaminated return distributions.

## 17. Object Salience in the Division of Labor: Experimental Evidence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
When we engage in the process of division of labor, there are typically multiple alternatives, but insufficient knowledge to choose among them. Under such conditions, we propose that not all alternatives are equally likely to be pursued. In particular, when we engage in the process of division of labor for novel and nonrepetitive production, we argue that we display a tendency to perceive and select object-based task partitions over activity-based partitions. We experimentally investigate how the salience of objects over activities manifests itself in individuals and groups engaged in division of labor for the assembly of strongly or weakly decomposable products. We draw implications for organization design as well as the impact of technological change on organizations.

## 18. Scheduling Homogeneous Impatient Customers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
Customer impatience has become an integral component of analyzing services, especially in the context of call centers. Typically, when customers arrive to such systems, they seem identical or homogeneous; however, from the system’s perspective, as they wait in the queue, their residual willingness to wait changes. For instance, a customer who has already waited for 10 minutes may have a different residual willingness to wait compared with a customer who has only waited for 1 minute. In this manner, as time progresses, customers become differentiated on their estimated patience levels. We exploit this dimension of customer heterogeneity to construct scheduling policies in overloaded systems that dynamically prioritize customers based on their time in queue to optimize any given system performance metric. Interestingly, the optimal policy has a very simple structure, and we find that implementing it can lead to significant improvements over the first-come, first-served policy.
