## 2. When Performance Trumps Gender Bias: Joint vs. Separate Evaluation

### Abstract:
Gender bias in the evaluation of job candidates has been demonstrated in business, government, and academia, yet little is known about how to overcome it. Blind evaluation procedures have been proven to significantly increase the likelihood that women musicians are chosen for orchestras, and they are employed by a few companies. We examine a new intervention to overcome gender bias in hiring, promotion, and job assignments: an “evaluation nudge” in which people are evaluated jointly rather than separately regarding their future performance. Evaluators are more likely to base their decisions on individual performance in joint than in separate evaluation and on group stereotypes in separate than in joint evaluation, making joint evaluation the profit-maximizing evaluation procedure. Our work is inspired by findings in behavioral decision research suggesting that people make more reasoned choices when examining options jointly rather than separately and is compatible with a behavioral model of information processing.

### Abstract:
This paper studies government subsidies for green technology adoption while considering the manufacturing industry’s response. Government subsidies offered directly to consumers impact the supplier’s production and pricing decisions. Our analysis expands the current understanding of the price-setting newsvendor model, incorporating the external influence from the government, who is now an additional player in the system. We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired adoption target level. From a coordination perspective, we demonstrate that the decentralized decisions are also optimal for a central planner managing jointly the supplier and the government. As a result, subsidies provide a coordination mechanism.

### Abstract:
We examine operational and incentive issues that conspire to reduce the quality of milk—via deliberate adulteration by milk farmers—acquired by competing collection intermediaries in developing countries. Broadly speaking, three main forces in the milk supply chain lead to the low quality of milk: high testing costs, harmful competition among stations, and free-riding among farmers. The goal of this study is to provide recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing. Interestingly, some intuitive interventions—such as providing stations with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities) or subsidizing testing costs—could hurt the quality of milk in the presence of competition. To save testing costs we utilize mixed testing, where the milk combined from multiple farmers is tested once. However, mixed testing makes the system vulnerable to free-riding among farmers. We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station conducts only one mixed test and no further testing.

## 5. The Design of Experiential Services with Acclimation and Memory Decay: Optimal Sequence and Duration

### Abstract:
For many consumer-intensive (i.e., business-to-consumer) services, delivering memorable customer experiences is a source of competitive advantage. Yet there are few guidelines available for designing service encounters with a focus on customer satisfaction. In this paper, we show how experiential services should be sequenced and timed to maximize the satisfaction of customers who are subject to memory decay and acclimation. We find that memory decay favors positioning the highest service level near the end, whereas acclimation favors maximizing the gradient of service level. Together, they maximize the gradient of service level near the end. Although memory decay and acclimation lead to the same design individually, they can act as opposing forces when considered jointly. Overall, our analysis suggests that short experiences should have activities scheduled as a crescendo and duration allocated primarily to the activities with the highest service levels, whereas long experiences should have activities scheduled in a U-shaped fashion and duration allocated primarily to activities with the lowest service level so as to ensure a steep gradient at the end.

### Abstract:
We study the alliance formation strategy among suppliers in a framework with one downstream firm and n upstream suppliers. Each supplier faces an exogenous random shock that may result in an order default. Each of them also has access to a recourse fund that can mitigate this risk. The suppliers can share the fund resources within an alliance, but they need to equitably allocate the profits of the alliance among the partners. In this context, suppliers need to decide whether to join larger alliances that have better chances of order fulfillment or smaller ones that may grant them higher profit allocations. We first analytically characterize the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation, rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers’ investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their coalition formation strategy. Last, we discuss model generalizations and show that, in general, our insights are quite robust.

## 7. Abnormal Accruals in Newly Public Companies: Opportunistic Misreporting or Economic Activity?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
Newly public companies tend to exhibit abnormally high accruals in the year of their initial public offering (IPO). Although the prevailing view in the literature is that these accruals are caused by opportunistic misreporting, we show that these accruals do not appear to benefit managers and instead result from the normal economic activity of newly public companies. In particular, and in contrast to the notion that managers benefit from inflating accruals through an inflated issue price, inflated post-IPO equity values, and increased insider trading profits, we find no evidence of a relation between abnormal accruals and these outcomes. Instead, consistent with these accruals resulting from normal economic activity, we find that these accruals are attributable to the investment of IPO proceeds in working capital and that controlling for the amount of IPO proceeds invested in working capital produces a more powerful accrual-based measure of misreporting.

### Abstract:
Most major health institutions recommend women to undergo repeat mammography screening for early diagnosis of breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Although the proportion of women who ever had a mammogram is increasing, a majority of women do not get repeat mammograms. This paper analyzes the role of heterogeneity in women’s adherence on optimal mammography screening recommendations. We develop a dynamic modeling framework that considers imperfect and heterogeneous adherence to screening recommendations. We carefully calibrate our model and solve it using real data. Unlike the existing breast cancer screening guidelines, our results suggest that adherence and heterogeneity in women’s adherence behaviors should be explicitly considered. In particular, we find that when screening strategies are optimized assuming average adherence for everyone, the effect on patients with already low adherence would be relatively small, but patients with high adherence would be adversely affected. Considering imperfect and heterogeneous adherence in the population, our model suggests (1) given the current low adherence rates, an aggressive screening policy such as annual screening between the ages of 40 and 79 should be promoted to the general population; (2) screening strategies may be adjusted in clinical practice based on women’s adherence, and screening intervals can be extended to two years for women with a history of high adherence; and (3) if the screening patterns change in the long run and most regular screeners adopt the most recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, then improving overall mammography adherence in society becomes more critical.

### Published:
- 2 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
Using a theorem showing that matching probabilities of ambiguous events can capture ambiguity attitudes, we introduce a tractable method for measuring ambiguity attitudes and apply it in a large representative sample. In addition to ambiguity aversion, we confirm an ambiguity component recently found in laboratory studies: a-insensitivity, the tendency to treat subjective likelihoods as 50-50, thus overweighting extreme events. Our ambiguity measurements are associated with real economic decisions; specifically, a-insensitivity is negatively related to stock market participation. Ambiguity aversion is also negatively related to stock market participation, but only for subjects who perceive stock returns as highly ambiguous.

## 10. Robust Comparative Statics of Risk Changes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
The standard method for establishing the comparative statics of risk changes in optimization problems has been confined to comparing unique interior solutions, relying on strong assumptions about payoff functions and decision variables. We propose a simple and intuitive approach that hinges on considerably weaker assumptions. Merging insights from the monotone comparative statics literature with insights from the risk apportionment literature, we show that the ranking of simple lottery pairs is all that is needed for establishing the comparative statics of risk changes. We use this approach to analyze the comparative statics of Nth-degree stochastic dominance shifts in a general setting with one and with multiple decision variables, and we show how these results can be applied to generalize the classical theories of precautionary saving, self-protection, and others.

## 11. Home Bias in Online Investments: An Empirical Study of an Online Crowdfunding Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Sep 2015
### Abstract:
An extensive literature in economics and finance has documented home bias, the tendency that transactions are more likely to occur between parties in the same geographical area rather than outside. Using data from a large online crowdfunding marketplace and employing a quasi-experimental design, we find evidence that home bias still exists in this virtual marketplace for financial products. Furthermore, through a series of empirical tests, we show that rationality-based explanations cannot fully explain such behavior and that behavioral reasons at least partially drive this remarkable phenomenon. As crowdfunding becomes an alternative and increasingly appealing channel for financing, a better understanding of home bias in this new context provides important managerial, practical, and policy implications.

## 12. Aging Population, Retirement, and Risk Taking
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
The increase in life expectancy spells disaster at retirement. One can solve this problem by investing in the maximum geometric mean (MGM) portfolio, which is empirically composed from equity. For a T = 30 year horizon or more, the MGM portfolio dominates other investment strategies by almost first-degree stochastic dominance. The MGM portfolio also maximizes the expected value of the commonly employed preferences and prospect theory value function, for various loss aversion parameters and various reference points, for T ≥ 10. Life-cycle funds would increase virtually all investors’ welfare by shifting to the MGM portfolio so long as the investment horizon is at least 10 years.

## 13. The Marginal Cost of Risk, Risk Measures, and Capital Allocation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
Financial institutions use risk measures to calculate the marginal capital cost when expanding the exposure to a certain risk within their portfolio. We reverse this approach by calculating the marginal cost based on economic fundamentals for a profit-maximizing firm and then by identifying the risk measure delivering the correct marginal cost. The resulting measure depends on context. Whereas familiar measures can be recovered in some circumstances, other circumstances yield unfamiliar forms. In all cases, the risk preferences of the institution’s claimants determine how the correct risk measure must weight various default states. Our results demonstrate that risk measures used for pricing and performance measurement should be chosen based on economic fundamentals and may not necessarily adhere to the mathematical properties typically imposed in the literature.

## 14. The Consumption and Wealth Effects of an Unanticipated Change in Lifetime Resources
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
In 2000, Italy replaced its traditional system of severance pay for public employees with a new system. Under the old regime, severance pay was proportional to the final salary before retirement; under the new regime it is proportional to lifetime earnings. This reform entails substantial losses for future generations of public employees, in the range of €20,000–30,000, depending on seniority. Using a difference-in-difference framework, we estimate the impact of this unanticipated change in lifetime resources, on the current consumption and wealth accumulation of employees affected by the reform. In line with theoretical simulations, we find that each euro reduction in severance pay reduces the average propensity to consume by 3 cents and increases the wealth-income ratio by 0.32. The response is stronger for younger workers and for households where both spouses are public sector employees.

## 15. Spillover Effects in Mutual Fund Companies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 May 2015
### Abstract:
Our paper investigates spillover effects across different business segments of publicly traded financial conglomerates. We find that the investment decisions of mutual fund shareholders do not depend only on the prior performance of the mutual funds; they also depend on the prior performance of the funds’ management companies. Flows into equity and bond mutual funds increase with the prior stock price performance of the funds’ management companies after controlling for fund performance and other fund characteristics. The sensitivity of flows to the management company’s performance is not justified by the subsequent performance of the affiliated funds. The results indicate that the reputation of a company’s brand has a significant impact on the behavior of its customers.

## 16. Technical Debt and the Reliability of Enterprise Software Systems: A Competing Risks Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Oct 2015
### Abstract:
Enterprise software systems are required to be highly reliable because they are central to the business operations of most firms. However, configuring and maintaining these systems can be highly complex, making it challenging to achieve high reliability. Resource-constrained software teams facing business pressures can be tempted to take design shortcuts in order to deliver business functionality more quickly. These design shortcuts and other maintenance activities contribute to the accumulation of technical debt, that is, a buildup of software maintenance obligations that need to be addressed in the future. We model and empirically analyze the impact of technical debt on system reliability by utilizing a longitudinal data set spanning the 10-year life cycle of a commercial enterprise system deployed at 48 different client firms. We use a competing risks analysis approach to discern the interdependency between client and vendor maintenance activities. This allows us to assess the effect of both problematic client modifications (client errors) and software errors present in the vendor-supplied platform (vendor errors) on system failures. We also examine the relative effects of modular and architectural maintenance activities undertaken by clients in order to analyze the dynamics of technical debt reduction. The results of our analysis first establish that technical debt decreases the reliability of enterprise systems. Second, modular maintenance targeted to reduce technical debt was approximately 53% more effective than architectural maintenance in reducing the probability of a system failure due to client errors, but it had the side effect of increasing the chance of a system failure due to vendor errors by approximately 83% more than did architectural maintenance activities. Using our empirical results we illustrate how firms could evaluate their business risk exposure due to technical debt accumulation in their enterprise systems, and we assess the estimated net effects, both positive and negative, of a range of software maintenance practices. Finally, we discuss implications for research in measuring and managing technical debt in enterprise systems.

### Published:
- 16 Mar 2016
### Abstract:
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and advanced cancer is often treated with combinations of multiple chemotherapy drugs. In this work, we develop models to predict the outcomes of clinical trials testing combination chemotherapy regimens before they are run and to select the combination chemotherapy regimens to be tested in new phase II and phase III clinical trials, with the primary objective of improving the quality of regimens tested in phase III trials compared to current practice. We built a database of 414 clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer and use it to build statistical models that attain an out-of-sample R2 of 0.56 when predicting a trial’s median overall survival (OS) and an out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 when predicting if a trial has unacceptably high toxicity. We propose models that use machine learning and optimization to suggest regimens to be tested in phase II and phase III trials. Though it is inherently challenging to evaluate the performance of such models without actually running clinical trials, we use two techniques to obtain estimates for the quality of regimens selected by our models compared with those actually tested in current clinical practice. Both techniques indicate that the models might improve the efficacy of the regimens selected for testing in phase III clinical trials without changing toxicity outcomes. This evaluation of the proposed models suggests that they merit further testing in a clinical trial setting.
