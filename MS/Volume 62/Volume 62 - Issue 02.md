## 2. Debt and Creative Destruction: Why Could Subsidizing Corporate Debt Be Optimal?
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
The existing theoretical literature provides little justification for a corporate debt subsidy. We illustrate the welfare benefit of this subsidy and study how the social costs and benefits change with the duration of industry distress. In our model, two firms engage in socially wasteful competition for survival in a declining industry. Firms differ on two dimensions: exogenous productivity and endogenously chosen amount of debt financing, resulting in a two-dimensional war of attrition. Debt financing increases incentives to exit, which, although costly for the firm, is socially beneficial. These benefits decline as industry distress shortens. Our normative model sheds light on why the debt tax subsidy still persists around the world. Analogously, the model can also rationalize a seemingly ad hoc feature of the U.S. tax system, which subsidizes the conflict of interest between debt and equity regarding firm liquidation.

## 3. Markdown or Everyday Low Price? The Role of Behavioral Motives

### Abstract:
We study a seller’s optimal pricing and inventory strategies when behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives affect consumers’ purchase decisions. In particular, the seller chooses between two pricing strategies, markdown or everyday low price, and determines the optimal prices and inventory level. Two salient behavioral motives that impact consumers’ purchase decisions and the seller’s optimal strategies are anticipated regret and misperception of product availability. Regret arises when a consumer initially chooses to wait but encounters stockout later, or when the consumer buys the product at the high price but realizes that the product is still available at the markdown price. In addition, consumers often perceive the product’s future availability to be different than its actual availability. We determine and quantify that both regret and availability misperception have significant operational and profit implications for the seller. For example, ignoring these behavioral factors can result in up to 10% profit losses. We contrast the roles of consumers’ strategic (pecuniary) motives with their behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives in affecting purchase, pricing, and inventory decisions. The presence of the behavioral motives reinstates the profitability of markdown over everyday low price, in sharp contrast to prior studies of only strategic motives that suggest the contrary. We characterize how and why strategic versus behavioral motives affect decisions in distinctive manners. In doing so, this paper also introduces and determines the behavioral benefits of pricing in leveraging consumers’ behavioral regularities. We advocate that tactics that may intensify consumers’ misperception of availability, such as disclosing low inventory levels, can have a far-reaching impact on improving the seller’s profit.

## 4. Investor Sentiment, Beta, and the Cost of Equity Capital
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Apr 2015
### Abstract:
The security market line accords with the capital asset pricing model by taking on an upward slope in pessimistic sentiment periods, but is downward sloping during optimistic periods. We hypothesize that this finding obtains because periods of optimism attract equity investment by unsophisticated, overconfident, traders in risky opportunities (high beta stocks), whereas such traders stay along the sidelines during pessimistic periods. Thus, high beta stocks become overpriced in optimistic periods, but during pessimistic periods, noise trading is reduced, so that traditional beta pricing prevails. Unconditional on sentiment, these effects offset each other. Although rational explanations cannot completely be ruled out, analyses using earnings expectations, fund flows, the probability of informed trading, and order imbalances do provide evidence that noise traders are more bullish about high beta stocks when sentiment is optimistic, whereas investor behavior appears to accord more closely with rationality during pessimistic periods, supporting our hypothesis.

## 5. Portfolio Choice with Market Closure and Implications for Liquidity Premia

### Published:
- 15 May 2015
### Abstract:
Most existing portfolio choice models ignore the prevalent periodic market closure and the fact that market volatility is significantly higher during trading periods. We find that market closure and the volatility difference across trading and nontrading periods significantly change optimal trading strategies. In addition, we demonstrate numerically that transaction costs can have a first-order effect on liquidity premia that is largely comparable to empirical findings. Moreover, this effect on liquidity premia increases in the volatility difference, which is supported by our empirical analysis.

## 6. Household Production and Asset Prices

### Abstract:
We empirically examine the asset pricing implications of the Beckerian framework of household production, where utility is derived from both market consumption and home produced goods. We propose residential electricity usage as a real-time proxy for the service flow from household capital, because electricity is used in most modern-day household production activities and it cannot be easily stored. Using U.S. residential electricity usage from 1955 to 2012, our model based on household production explains the equity premium and the cross section of expected stock returns (including those of industry portfolios) with an R2 of 71%.

## 7. Strategic Waiting for Consumer-Generated Quality Information: Dynamic Pricing of New Experience Goods
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the impact of consumer-generated quality information (e.g., consumer reviews) on a firm’s dynamic pricing strategy in the presence of strategic consumers. Such information is useful, not only to the consumers that have not yet purchased the product but also to the firm. The informativeness of the consumer-generated quality information depends, however, on the volume of consumers who share their opinions and, thus, depends on the initial sales volume. Hence, via its initial price, the firm not only influences its revenue but also controls the quality information flow over time. The firm may either enhance or dampen the quality information flow via increasing or decreasing initial sales. The corresponding pricing strategy to steer the quality information flow is not always intuitive. Compared to the case without consumer-generated quality information, the firm may reduce the initial sales and lower the initial price. Interestingly, the firm may get strictly worse off due to the consumer-generated quality information. Even when the firm benefits from consumer-generated quality information, it may prefer less accurate information. Consumer surplus can also decrease due to the consumer-generated quality information, contrary to the conventional wisdom that word of mouth should help consumers. We examine extensions of our model that incorporate capacity investment, firm’s private information about quality, alternative updating mechanisms, as well as multiple sales periods, and show that our insights are robust.

## 8. Sourcing Strategies and Supplier Incentives for Short-Life-Cycle Goods
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
Multiple sourcing with quick response has been recognized as a useful tool to manage demand risk for short-life-cycle goods. However, general wisdom has traditionally ignored the effect of these practices on supplier incentives. In this paper we find that, when suppliers make pricing decisions, dual sourcing does not always lead to higher supply chain efficiency or buyer profits as compared to single sourcing. This loss takes place when suppliers commit to prices up front, before any possible forecast change, but not when they delay the price quotes after demand forecasts have been updated. Specifically, with up-front price commitment, dual sourcing leads to inflation of supplier prices because expensive suppliers will still receive part of the business if they are sufficiently quick. Thus, when supplier prices are endogenous, double marginalization may offset the additional buyer profit enabled by higher ordering flexibility. In contrast, with delayed price quotes, a buyer will find dual sourcing beneficial because single sourcing locks it into a monopolistic supplier that extracts most of the available rent.

## 9. Does the Firm Information Environment Influence Financing Decisions? A Test Using Disclosure Regulation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
Extant theory claims a firm’s information environment impacts the choice between debt and equity financing. However, empirical evidence supporting this contention is limited. We evaluate this relation within the context of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD), which prohibited the use of selective disclosure. We find that firms with high proprietary costs of public disclosure are more likely to resort to debt financing following the passage of Reg FD. This relation is not sensitive to whether a firm has relied on selective disclosure in the pre-Reg FD regime. We also evaluate changes in firm disclosure policy and find that firms that adopted an expansive public disclosure policy are more likely to turn to equity financing. Overall, our evidence is consistent with the pecking order theory: firms with deteriorated firm information environments increase their use of less information-sensitive debt, whereas firms with improved information environments favor the use of equity financing.

## 10. Financial Distress Risk and New CEO Compensation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
We examine how ex ante financial distress risk affects CEO compensation. To disentangle the joint effects of performance on compensation and distress risk, we focus our analyses on new CEOs. Our results indicate that financial distress risk affects compensation through two channels. First, new CEOs receive significantly more compensation when financial distress risk is higher. This finding is consistent with CEOs receiving a compensation premium for bearing this risk since CEOs experience large personal costs if their firms later become financially distressed. Second, financial distress risk is associated with the incentives provided to new CEOs; distress risk is positively associated with pay-performance sensitivity and equity-based compensation and is negatively associated with cash bonuses. Further, financial distress risk is positively associated with pay-risk sensitivity for new CEOs. These findings suggest that financial distress risk alters the nature of the agency relationship in ways that lead firms to provide CEOs with more equity-based incentives. We also build on research that finds a positive relation between forced turnover risk and CEO compensation. Our analyses suggest the compensation effects of forced turnover risk appear to be mainly attributable to financial distress risk. Overall, our results indicate financial distress risk is an economically important determinant of new CEO compensation packages.

## 11. Discretionary Sanctions and Rewards in the Repeated Inspection Game
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
We experimentally investigate a repeated “inspection game” where, in the stage game, an employee can either work or shirk and an employer simultaneously chooses to inspect or not inspect. The unique equilibrium of the stage game is in mixed strategies with positive probabilities of shirking/inspecting while combined payoffs are maximized when the employee works and the employer does not inspect. We examine the effects of allowing the employer discretion to sanction or reward the employee after observing stage game payoffs. When employers have limited discretion, and can only apply sanctions and/or rewards following an inspection, we find that both instruments are equally effective in reducing shirking and increasing joint earnings. When employers have discretion to reward and/or sanction independently of whether they inspect, we find that rewards are more effective than sanctions. In treatments where employers can combine sanctions and rewards, employers rely mainly on rewards, and outcomes closely resemble those of treatments where only rewards are possible.

## 12. Collusion in Dynamic Buyer-Determined Reverse Auctions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 5 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
Although binding reverse auctions have attracted a good deal of interest in the academic literature, in practice, dynamic nonbinding reverse auctions are the norm in procurement. In those, suppliers submit price quotes and can respond to quotes of their competitors during a live auction event. However, the lowest quote does not necessarily determine the winner. The buyer decides after the contest, taking further supplier information into account, on who will be awarded the contract. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this bidding format enables suppliers to collude, thus leading to noncompetitive prices.

## 13. Equilibrium Innovation Ecosystems: The Dark Side of Collaborating with Complementors
### Author(s):
- Andrea Mantovani
- Francisco Ruiz-Aliseda
### Published:
- 7 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
We provide a rationale for the recent burst in the amount of collaborative activities among firms selling complementary products, highlighting factors that may result in a lower profitability for such firms overall. To this end, we examine a game-theoretic model in which firms can collaborate with producers of complementary goods to enhance the quality of the systems formed by their components. Collaboration makes it cheaper to enhance such quality, so building innovation ecosystems results in firms investing more than if collaboration were impossible. In markets reaching saturation, firms are trapped in a prisoner’s dilemma: the greater investments create more value, but this does not translate into greater value capture because the value created relative to competitors does not change. We also examine the (dis)advantages for a firm of having open or closed interfaces for the component it sells when the environment is competitive as well as how this is related to the endogenous emergence of two-sided platforms.

## 14. Impact of Bayesian Learning and Externalities on Strategic Investment

### Published:
- 18 Aug 2015
### Abstract:
We investigate the interplay between learning effects and externalities in the problem of competitive investments with uncertain returns. We examine a game theoretic duopoly investment model in which (i) a firm can learn about the profitability of the investment by observing the performance of the first mover and (ii) externalities exist between the investments of two firms. We find a region of a war of attrition between the two firms in which the interplay between externalities and learning gives rise to counterintuitive effects on investment strategies and payoffs. In particular, we find that, contrary to the conventional war of attrition where an increase in benefits for the follower generally delays the first move, an increase in the rate of learning—which tends to benefit the follower—can hasten the first investment.

## 15. How Point-of-Sale Marketing Mix Impacts National-Brand Purchase Shares
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 7 May 2015
### Abstract:
Purchase shares of major national brands in consumer packaged-goods industries vary substantially across stores, both between geographic markets and across stores within markets. We measure the relationship between the variation in national-brand purchase shares and five store-specific marketing mix factors: prices, assortment shares, features, displays, and promotion intensity. We do this by first demonstrating the extent to which purchase shares of the top two national brands across six different categories vary across markets, accounts (defined as chain–market interactions) and stores: market-level variation accounts for approximately 30% of the weekly purchase share variation across stores, whereas account-level and store-level variation explain an additional 13% and 5% of the variation, respectively. We then measure the extent to which assortment, pricing, feature, display, and promotion activities affect the purchase shares of the top national brands. We find that price and assortment share are the two most important point-of-sale factors in determining a brand’s purchase share. We also examine how the proximity to a brand’s city of origin, the assortment share of a store’s private label, the extent of retail competition, and the demographics of the store’s neighborhood affect the purchase share’s sensitivity to the point-of-sale marketing mix, revealing several subtle effects. Finally, we measure the extent to which the variation in top national-brand purchase shares is explained by these five factors. We find that, on average, approximately 56% of the variation in national-brand purchase shares can be attributed to these five factors. These results demonstrate the potential importance of trade marketing on a brand’s purchase shares.

## 16. Repeated Interactions and Improved Outcomes: An Empirical Analysis of Movie Production in the United States
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2015
### Abstract:
Many marketing activities take place within teams; these team activities often involve repeated interactions among team members over several projects. We study whether and what types of repeated interactions improve current production success, and under what conditions. We use a unique data set of past experience, successes, and pairwise interactions between members of production teams of 1,123 movies and employ dynamic panel data estimation methods. Three unique insights emerge. Interactions between the producer and other team members have a greater effect on revenues than other repeated pairs for which consumers might have preferences. In many instances, repeated interactions with current team members are more revenue enhancing than individual successes in past movies. In fact, repeated interactions between team members improve current revenues even if such interactions were unsuccessful. We discuss theoretical explanations for these results and the managerial implications for successful team formation in movie production.

## 17. The Relationship Between Workplace Stressors and Mortality and Health Costs in the United States
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
Even though epidemiological evidence links specific workplace stressors to health outcomes, the aggregate contribution of these factors to overall mortality and health spending in the United States is not known. In this paper, we build a model to estimate the excess mortality and incremental health expenditures associated with exposure to the following 10 workplace stressors: unemployment, lack of health insurance, exposure to shift work, long working hours, job insecurity, work–family conflict, low job control, high job demands, low social support at work, and low organizational justice. Our model uses input parameters obtained from publicly accessible data sources. We estimated health spending from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and joint probabilities of workplace exposures from the General Social Survey, and we conducted a meta-analysis of the epidemiological literature to estimate the relative risks of poor health outcomes associated with exposure to these stressors. The model was designed to overcome limitations with using inputs from multiple data sources. Specifically, the model separately derives optimistic and conservative estimates of the effect of multiple workplace exposures on health, and uses optimization to calculate upper and lower bounds around each estimate, which accounts for the correlation between exposures. We find that more than 120,000 deaths per year and approximately 5%–8% of annual healthcare costs are associated with and may be attributable to how U.S. companies manage their work forces. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to management practices as important contributors to health outcomes and costs in the United States.
