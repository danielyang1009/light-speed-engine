## 1. Recent Developments in Management Science in Banking
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
Banking has been a fertile area for management science applications, as is evident from the review provided in this paper. The relevant management science models are discussed in terms of the areas of bank management for which they were intended. Under dynamic balance sheet management (i.e., internal bank financial planning) we consider forecasting techniques, simulation models and optimization models. Other areas of banking included are bond portfolio management, bank operations, corporate services, bank marketing and management of the loan portfolio. The authors provide an evaluation of the applicability of management science models in practice, discuss the extent to which some have been implemented and consider the philosophy of using management science models in banking.

## 2. Inverse Optimization: An Application to the Capacitated Plant Location Problem

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
Lagrangean techniques have had wide application to the optimization of discrete optimization problems. Inverse optimization refers to the fact that each time a Lagrangean calculation is made for a specific problem with a given resources vector, an optimal solution is obtained for a related problem with a suitably adjusted resources vector. This property is studied in depth for the capacitated plant location problem and new parametric methods for that problem are suggested. Computational experience is reported.

## 3. A Hybrid Method for the Solution of Some Multi-Commodity Spatial Equilibrium Problems
### Author(s):
- Jong-Shi Pang
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
This paper describes a hybrid method for solving the multi-commodity transportation and transshipment spatial equilibrium models. The method is basically a specialization of the block successive overrelaxation method for solving a linear complementarity problem with certain block structure and consists of solving a sequence of subproblems of the single-commodity type. These subproblems are solved by a special-purpose principal pivoting algorithm developed in an earlier paper. Under some mild conditions, convergence of the proposed method is established. Finally, computational experience of solving some fairly large randomly generated problems by the proposed hybrid method is presented.

## 4. Strategic Control of Corporate Development Under Ambiguous Circumstances
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
The theory of corporate strategic decision-making has traditionally been dominated by a planning orientation. The corporation was assumed to have reliable information and few strategic constraints over its development horizon. While this approach may have been relevant during the 1950's and 1960's, the emergence of public interest groups and increased activities of government agencies in the 1970's and 1980's has constrained corporate influence and has increased the ambiguity in the environment for strategic decisions. This state of affairs has been noted in a general manner by practitioners and some theorists. This paper, after reviewing various approaches to strategic decision-making, develops an analytic model that places corporate development in a control framework. In this new approach managers are not required to set precise long-range goals nor is the information required expected to be as reliable in the long run as it is in the short run, nor equally reliable across all dimensions of decision-making. The strategic control approach links a relatively ambiguous long-range environment to a more certain short run environment through the concept of a mid-range corporate development window. Planning per se is then a short-range process directed, not at precise long-range goals, but rather at a mid-range performance window the attainment of which will position the corporation so that it will have a high probability of reaching the loosely defined set of long-range goals. Strategic control is a new framework for assessing the theory and guiding the practice of strategic decision making for corporate development.

## 5. Continuous Review (s, S) Policies with Lost Sales
### Author(s):
- Blyth C. Archibald
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
A method is developed to calculate an (s, S) policy that minimizes the average stationary cost in an inventory system with: constant lead time, fixed order cost, linear holding cost per unit time, linear penalty cost per unit short, discrete compound Poisson demand, and lost sales. It is assumed that at most one order is outstanding, or equivalently that S  s > s. The procedure is compared to several easier-to-compute approximate solutions, including one that assumes backordering. Examples are given that reveal that although the backorder solution is different than the lost sales one, the cost penalty of using it in the lost sales situation is small.

## 6. Algorithms for the State Probabilities in a General Class of Single Server Queueing Systems with Group Arrivals
### Author(s):
- M. H. van Hoorn
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
Single server queues with batch arrivals are useful in the modeling of computer and communication systems amongst others. In this paper we give for a wide class of single server queues with batch arrivals a stable recursive method to compute state probabilities both at arrival and at arbitrary epochs. This class includes finite capacity models with state dependent Markovian input in which batches could be totally or partially rejected. The customers of a batch are served individually and the service time has a general distribution function. In particular, we discuss as application the computation of operating characteristics, such as rejection probability and probability of server idleness, for a finite capacity M/G/1 queue for which arriving customers are rejected if their waiting plus service times exceed the capacity of the system.

## 7. A Diffusion Approximation for Bulk Queues
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
In this paper the steady-state queue size behavior of single-server queues with bulk-arrival and batch-service, referred to as bulk queues, is approximated by a diffusion process using the instantaneous return approach. Diffusion approximation solutions for various queue size statistics are developed and evaluated for a number of special Markovian-like bulk queues. The approximate solutions are found to be robust for queues under heavy traffic, and in certain cases, under other traffic conditions.

## 8. A Parametric Representation of Additive Value Functions
### Author(s):
- Thomas W. Keelin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a new parameter for measuring deterministic preference tradeoffs between pairs of attributes. In terms of this parameter, necessary and sufficient conditions for a value function to be additive are established. When additivity conditions are satisfied, a set of these parameters is shown to characterize the value function uniquely up to a set of scaling constants. Implications for assessment, for transforming a nonadditive representation into an additive one, and for multiattribute utility functions are presented.

## 9. A Greedy Heuristic for Single Machine Sequencing with Precedence Constraints
### Author(s):
- Howard J. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1981
### Abstract:
We present a greedy heuristic for the n job/1 machine scheduling problem with precedence constraints. This method is useful whenever the manager's optimization criteria is the sum of weighted or unweighted completion times, the sum of weighted or unweighted flow times, (with or without release dates), the sum of weighted or unweighted working times, the sum of weighted or unweighted lateness, average completion time, average flow time, average waiting time or average lateness. The greedy heuristic found the optimal solution for 58 of 68 test problems for which a branch and bound method was used to find the optimal solution. The heuristic is, of course, much easier to implement (and executes in less time). The greedy heuristic fared well in comparison with a simple myopic heuristic presented by Morton and Dharan (Morton. T. E., B. G. Dharan. 1978. Algoristics for single machine sequencing with precedence constraints. Management Sci.24 (10) 10111020.).
