## 1. Minimizing Net Interest Cost in Municipal Bond Bidding
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Nauss

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
The problem of minimizing net interest cost (NIC) on new issues of tax-exempt debt securities is formulated as an integer linear programming problem. The formulation (for one variant) is a p-median problem with one additional constraint.

## 2. Methods of Large Project Assessment Given Uncertainty in Future Energy Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The continuing oil crisis has created opportunities for developing sources of oil that had only been marginally economic previously. Many such projects, however, require large-scale investments that are recoverable only over very long lifetimes of operation. The profitability of such investments depends critically on the long-run pricing of oil in world markets and the interaction of the economic conditions of consuming nations.

## 3. A Linear Goal Programming Model for Developing Economies with an Illustration from the Agricultural Sector in Egypt

### Abstract:
In this study we formulate a multi-regional single time period linear goal programming model for agricultural planning in a developing economy. In addition to specifying different levels of input and output for each activity, we describe explicit crop interdependencies which account for rotational requirements. Constraints are developed for land, labor, water, machinery, fertilizer, and capital resources. Economic aspects are addressed through the use of different production functions and the incorporation of several objectives. This last point marks a departure from conventional models which stress maximization of economic welfare defined as efficiency through maximum social product without consideration for income distribution. The emphasis on income distribution is reflected in our model in delineation of regional employment goals. In addition, foreign exchange expenditures and regional demand satisfaction goals reflect the importance of limiting foreign trade deficit and providing basic nutrition for the population. The decisions suggested by the solution include acreage allocated to different crops, sequences of crop rotations, fertilization levels, and transportation and distribution of crops and livestock among the regions. We illustrate the model using data from the agricultural regions with three cropping seasons: winter, summer, and nili (autumn). The activities covered by the model consist of ten winter crops, seven summer crops, three nili crops, two permanent crops, two pasture types, four livestock types, and three types of fertilizers. The crops are modeled in sequences to minimize the detrimental effects of cotton. The results suggested by the model show the need for using improved farming techniques through labor-intensive means to obtain a relatively higher degree of specialization and a relatively lower cotton production. This latter conclusion confirms that reached by an independent study of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Ministry of Agriculture in Egypt. Several computer runs are conducted to test sensitivity of the results to major assumptions and goal targets. It is felt that the model presented in this study would be useful to management scientists, agricultural planners, especially those in developing countries, and to various United Nations organizations such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

## 4. Portfolio Optimization Models for Property-Liability Insurance Companies: An Analysis and Some Extensions
### Author(s):
- J. David Cummins
- David J. Nye
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model to assist property-liability insurance companies in making product and investment mix decisions. A quadratic programming approach is used to generate mean-variance efficient frontiers that reflect the covariability of returns on insurance lines and assets. The solution indicates the overall premium-to-surplus ratio, the distribution of premiums among insurance lines, and the proportion of assets in each major investment class that are consistent with the minimum level of risk for a given expected rate of return on net worth. Recognition is given to the tendency for some insurance lines to generate more investable funds than others due to longer lags between claim occurrence and settlement. The importance of federal income taxes in insurance company decision making is recognized, and a method is suggested for including taxes in the model.

## 5. Disaggregation and Resource Allocation Using Convex Knapsack Problems with Bounded Variables
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Arnoldo C. Hax
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
The allocation of a specific amount of a given resource among competitive alternatives can often be modelled as a knapsack problem. This model formulation is extremely efficient because it allows convex cost representation with bounded variables to be solved without great computational efforts. Practical applications of this problem abound in the fields of operations management, finance, manpower planning, marketing, etc. In particular, knapsack problems emerge in hierarchical planning systems when a first level of decisions need to be further allocated among specific activities which have been previously treated in an aggregate way.

## 6. The Quadratic Assignment Problem: An Experimental Evaluation of Solution Strategies
### Author(s):
- Robin Segerblom Liggett
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
Since procedures for producing optimal solutions to a quadratic assignment problem are computationally infeasible for any but small problems, heuristic techniques for producing approximate solutions must be employed for the solution of real practical problems. This paper presents the results of experimentation that demonstrates that a solution procedure which couples a constructive initial placement technique with simple and inexpensive improvement procedures produces good solutions with very reasonable computation requirements. The results indicate that such an approach would make the solution of large-scale quadratic assignment problems feasible.

## 7. Early Diagnosis of MIS Implementation Failure: Promising Results and Unanswered Questions
### Author(s):
- Michael J. Ginzberg
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
Much of the research on MIS implementation which has been conducted in the past decade has focused on identifying and measuring the organizational characteristics which appear to be particularly conducive to either success or failure of system development efforts. While such research is useful in providing insight about the implementation problem, it provides little guidance for the management of ongoing implementation efforts. The study described in this paper attempts to address the implementation management question by exploring the use of MIS users' pre-implementation expectations about a system as indicators of the likely success of that system.

## 8. Combining Probability Distributions from Dependent Information Sources
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
Inferences or decisions in the face of uncertainty should be based on all available information. Thus, when probability distributions for an uncertain quantity are obtained from experts, models, or other information sources, these distributions should be combined to form a single consensus distribution upon which inferences and decisions can be based. An important feature of information from different sources is the possibility of stochastic dependence, and a consensus model which formally allows for such dependence is developed in this paper. Under normality, the model yields reasonably tractable results, and the consensus distribution is quite sensitive to the degree of dependence.

## 9. CommunicationCar-Pooling and Regional Ridesharing Programs
### Author(s):
- Gregory J. Westerbeck
- James R. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1981
### Abstract:
Professors Leff (Management Science, Vol. 25, No. 8 (1979), p. 810) and Robinson (Management Science, Vol. 26, No. 4 (1980), pp. 433434) have raised an interesting debate regarding car pool systems, algorithms, and human problems. Professor Leff sees the use of increasingly refined algorithms as the solution to forming carpools. Dr. Robinson, on the other hand, sees algorithms as the least part of a successful carpool system. In answer to Dr. Leff's query, algorithms are available to assist in ridesharing matching.
