## 1. Forecasting and Planning: An Evaluation

### Abstract:
The formal practice of forecasting and planning (F&P) has risen to prominence within a few decades and now receives considerable attention from both academics and practitioners. This paper explicitly recognizes the nature of F&P as future-oriented decision making activities and, as such, their dependence upon judgmental inputs. A review of the extensive psychological literature on human judgmental abilities is provided from this perspective. It is argued that many of the numerous information processing limitations and biases revealed in this literature apply to tasks performed in F&P. In particular, the illusion of control, accumulation of redundant information, failure to seek possible disconfirming evidence, and overconfidence in judgment are liable to induce serious errors in F&P. In addition, insufficient attention has been given to the implications of numerous studies that show that the predictive judgment of humans is frequently less accurate than that of simple quantitative models. Applied studies of F&P are also reviewed and shown to mirror many of the findings from psychology. The paper subsequently draws implications from these reviews and suggests reconceptualizing F&P through use of decision-theoretic concepts. At the organizational level this involves recognizing that F&P may perform many, often conflicting, manifest and latent functions which should be identified and evaluated through a multi-attribute utility framework. Operationally, greater use should be made of sensitivity analysis and the concept of the value of information.

## 2. Planned Change: Prospects for the 1980s
### Author(s):
- Gerald I. Susman
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to suggest some directions in the 1980s for the development of the theory and practice of planned change. The author makes two basic assumptions in approaching this objective. First, the two fields most widely associated with planned change, organization development and planning, are increasingly addressing similar or related problems and, as a result, offer significant opportunities to contribute to the development of the other. Second, we will not learn very much about directions for the field of planned change if discussion proceeds without consideration of the kinds of concrete problems we will likely face in the 1980s. The opportunities suggested in the first assumption will become clear by presenting some illustrative problems to be faced in the 1980s.

## 3. Benefit-Cost Analysis of a Proposed Runway Extension
### Author(s):
- Cary Swoveland
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
This paper describes a benefit-cost analysis of a proposed $1.4 million runway extension at Kelowna Airport, in Kelowna, British Columbia (Canada's westernmost province). Lengthening the runway as proposed would allow Pacific Western Airlines to operate their Boeing 737 aircraft out of Kelowna with heavier payloads, thereby reducing the occurance of situations where the combined passenger and cargo demand exceeds the available weight capacity of the aircraft. The problem is complicated by the fact that the maximum payload weight permitted on take-off varies considerably with the air temperature and wind speed and direction at the time of departure. On hot summer days, when the problem is most severe, it is sometimes necessary to remove all of the cargo from the aircraft, and, at times, to limit the number of passengers taking the flight to less than the number of seats. An alternative means of achieving the objectives of the runway extension was also considered: lowering the average demand per flight by simply increasing the number of flights out of Kelowna.

## 4. Selecting a Portfolio of Solar Energy Projects Using Multiattribute Preference Theory
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
This article reports a procedure developed to assist the U.S. Department of Energy in selecting a portfolio of solar energy applications experiments. The procedure has also been used in other government procurements and appears to be applicable in a variety of project funding processes. The technical quality of each proposed applications experiment was summarized through the use of multiple evaluation measures, or attributes. These were combined into a single index of the overall technical quality of an experiment through the use of a multiattribute utility function. Recently derived results in measurable value theory were applied to derive an index of the overall technical quality of a portfolio of experiments. Budgetary and programmatic issues were handled through the use of constraints. This approach allowed the portfolio selection problem to be formulated as an integer linear program. Details of the application are presented, including a discussion of the data requirements and assessment procedure used. The portfolio selection procedure was successfully applied, and variations of it have been successfully used in four other solar energy procurements.

## 5. Conditions on Risk Attitude for a Single Attribute
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
For a decision problem having consequences described by a single attribute, the task of determining a utility function can be facilitated by verifying that the decision maker's risk attitude satisfies a condition such as constant risk aversion. We investigate a general class of conditions on risk attitude, and show that a utility function for such a condition may exist only when the condition is of a special type. Next, we discuss and interpret conditions of this special type. Then, we define two conditions which imply that the decision maker's risk attitude satisfies a condition of this type and is represented by a generalized logarithmic utility function or a linear fractional utility function.

## 6. Product-Mix Models When Learning Effects are Present
### Author(s):
- Gary R. Reeves
- James R. Sweigart
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
An important problem confronting decision makers in modern organizations is the determination of an optimal product-mix (or service-mix) in situations where learning effects are present. Learning has been observed to exist in a variety of production and service situations in which the amount of input required per unit of output decreases as total output increases. Little research has appeared, however, on the incorporation of learning effects into resource allocation models that attempt to determine good or optimal allocations of scarce resources to competing activities via mathematical programming. Enriching a traditional linear programming product-mix model to include learning effects results in a nonlinear model which may be more realistic, but is also likely to be more difficult to solve.

## 7. Deployment of One- vs. Two-Officer Patrol Units: A Comparison of Travel Times
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Chelst
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
In this paper we compare the performance of one-officer and two-officer police patrol units using travel time as the measure of performance. We estimate travel times under two different models of dispatch operations. The first model reflects most existing dispatch systems in which patrol units are assigned to specific beats. Under this beat system, the dispatcher does not know the precise location of each police unit, so he often does not dispatch the closest unit. The second model treats a dispatch operation that is supported by an automatic vehicle monitoring system (AVM). With this system, police units can patrol an overlapping region and the closest available unit to a call can always be dispatched.

## 8. NoteAn Objective Function Perturbation with Economic Interpretations
### Author(s):
- A. L. Soyster
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1981
### Abstract:
For an ordinary linear program it is well known that, if the resources are evaluated at marginal prices determined by an optimal dual solution, then this imputed value is identical with the value of the primal objective function. For a convex program with a nonlinear objective function and linear constraints this identity in general does not hold. The resulting difference is due to a returns to scale associated with the objective function, as earlier pointed out by Balinski and Baumol (Balinski, M. L., W. J. Baumol. 1968. The dual in nonlinear programming and its economic interpretation. Rev. Econom. Studies35 237256.). In this paper we consider a certain perturbation of the objective function that characterizes the difference between the objective function value and imputed marginal cost This perturbation, when applied to a certain class of profit maximizing monopolies, explains the difference between the monopoly price and the marginal production cost.
