### Abstract:
This paper develops a model and an associated estimation procedure to forecast and control the rate of sales for a new product. A repeat-purchase diffusion model is developed, incorporating the effect of marketing variablesdetailing force effects in particularas well as a word-of-mouth effect. Bayesian estimation, with priors developed from past products is used to estimate and update the parameters of the model. The procedure is used to develop marketing policies for new product introduction.

## 2. Bed Allocation in a Public Health Care Delivery System

### Abstract:
Due to changing patient loads and demand patterns over time, assigning bed complements for various medical services in a hospital is a recurring problem facing the administrators. For a large public health care delivery system, we present an approach for periodically reallocating beds to services to minimize the expected overflows. Using a queueing model to approximate the patient population dynamics for each servicewith admission rates provided by forecaststhe expected overflows under each configuration are computed via a Normal loss integral. Bed allocation is done in two stages. First, we establish a base line requirement for each service so that it can handle a prescribed amount of patient load based on a yearly projection of demand. We then use marginal analysis to distribute the remaining beds to minimize the expected total average overflows while taking month-to-month demand fluctuations into account. The proposed model requires only a modest amount of computation, because of several simplifying assumptions, which were tested for reasonableness. For the two largest services, we used empirical data to evaluate the nonhomogeneous Poisson representation of admissions, and we performed simulation experiments to assess the extent of discrepancy in performance characteristics caused by the ignorance of day-of-week effect on admission rates. In view of the intrinsic complexity of the underlying system, the results obtained from the validation studies suggest that the model is relatively "robust" with respect to the case under consideration. It is hoped that the simplicity of the model and the usefulness of the results will induce practitioners to use this type of formal analysis for bed allocation in an institutional setting on a routine basis.

## 3. A Mixed Integer Programming Model for Regional Planning of a Hospital Inpatient Service
### Author(s):
- R. Jean Ruth
### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
This paper describes a quantitative model to aid in planning an efficient and effective hospital inpatient service among hospitals in a region. The planning is to be done by a regional health systems planning agency, which sets or enforces standards of accessibility and acceptability to be achieved through a modification of the current system, particularly the allocation of beds to the population-at-risk. The allocation is defined in terms of matching beds to demand, where demand is classified by geographical areas and by level of care required. The allocation is to be done such that the planning goals, expressed in constraints on accessibility and acceptability of the inpatient service, are satisfied. In particular, the population within the region should have access to an adequate supply of beds, and the inpatient service should be of appropriate level and quality to meet the demand of the population.

## 4. Selective Sequential Zero-Base Budgeting Procedures Based on Total Factor Productivity Indicators
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
The authors' purpose in this paper is to develop productivity-based sequential budgeting procedures designed to expedite identification of major problem areas in bugetary performance, as well as to reduce the costs associated with comprehensive zero-base analyses. The concept of total factor productivity is reviewed and its relations to ordinary and zero-based budgeting are discussed in detail. An outline for a selective sequential analysis based on monitoring of three key indicators of (a) implicitly budgeted total factor productivity; (b) revenue growth; and (c) profitability; is suggested. It is argued that this approach is instrumental in promoting a more systematic performance analysis, which is capable of revealing hidden efficiency shortfalls and is potentially cost and time saving. Additionally, this type of productivity-based budgeting is shown (via use of an actual application) to provide all the informational inputs for a full-fledged analysis of expected budgetary distribution of productivity gains among various categories of employees, shareholders and customers.

## 5. Variable-Base Budgeting for R&D
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Blanning
### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
An issue of theoretical and practical importance to R&D managers is the proper allocation of an organization's resources between the periodic selection and budgeting of R&D projects and the implementation of these projects. One possibility is to consider previous allocations as an established base and to restrict the attention of R&D managers to an examination of any subsequent deviations from the base. The advantage of this strategy, often called incremental budgeting, is that it focuses managerial and analytical efforts on a few current decisions. A second possibility, called zero-base budgeting, is to ignore previous allocations and to reexamine all feasible alternatives at the start of each budget cycle. This paper presents three models, a static model and two dynamic models, in which incremental and zero-base allocation procedures are viewed as extremes between which there may be a point of diminishing returns.

## 6. Policy Analyses for an Infant Technology: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Resources
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
This paper demonstrates the potential role of policy and management analyses at early stages of technology development as exemplified by the case of hot, dry rock (HDR) geothermal energy resources used for electricity generation. Management issues concerning initial drilling depths, power plant design, redrilling strategies and periodic choices for well-flow rates are analyzed as they relate to R and D policies concerning first, the staging of R and D within the HDR R and D program and, second, priorities for the HDR research program relative to other R and D programs. Results reported here suggest that commercially attractive HDR systems do not require the development of new, very high temperature drilling technology (>275C). Priorities for research concerning reservoir renewal and completion methods and baseload dimensions of an HDR system are emphasized. The desirability of periodic variations in well-flow rates as a means to reduce reservoir cooling is shown to be questionable. The commercial potential of HDR-produced electricity is assessed using calculations of the busbar cost of electricity from optimally-managed HDR geothermal systems. Busbar costs for a plausible set of base case conditions were found to vary between 2676 mills kWh (1978 dollars) as geothermal gradients varied between 3060C per kilometer of vertical depth. Commercial feasibility for HDR-produced electricity then involves a comparison of these costs with one's expectations for future busbar costs for electricity produced with other fuel sources.

## 7. Due Date Assignment for Production Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the study of the constant due-date assignment policy in a dynamic job shop. Assuming that production times are randomly distributed, each job has a penalty cost that is some non-linear function of its due-date and its actual completion time. The due date is found by adding a constant to the time the job arrives to the shop. This constant time allowed in the shop is the lead time that a customer might expect between time of placing the order and time of delivery. The objective is to minimize the expected aggregate cost per job subject to restrictive assumptions on the priority discipline and the penalty functions. This aggregate cost includes (1) a cost that increases with increasing lead times, (2) a cost for jobs that are delivered after the due dates: the cost is proportional to tardiness and (3) a cost proportional to earliness for jobs that are completed prior to the due dates. We present an algorithm for solving this problem and show that the optimal lead time is a unique minimum point of strictly convex functions. The algorithm utilizes analytical procedures; computations can be made manually. No specific distributions are assumed; the distribution of total time a job is in the shop is utilized by the algorithm. This distribution can be theoretical or empirical. An example of a production system is presented.

## 8. Minimizing Makespan with Bimodal Processing Time Distributions
### Author(s):
- Michael Pinedo
### Published:
- 1 May 1981
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of scheduling n tasks on two identical parallel processors. Task i has a processing time of one time unit, but might have to undergo processing for a second time unit with probability pi, i.e., the processing time distributions of the tasks have mass only on one and on two. We are interested in the sequence in which to process these tasks in order to minimize the expected completion time of all tasks. The optimal sequence turns out to be a sequence not well-known in the theory of scheduling.
