## 1. The Lagrangian Relaxation Method for Solving Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Marshall L. Fisher
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
One of the most computationally useful ideas of the 1970s is the observation that many hard integer programming problems can be viewed as easy problems complicated by a relatively small set of side constraints. Dualizing the side constraints produces a Lagrangian problem that is easy to solve and whose optimal value is a lower bound (for minimization problems) on the optimal value of the original problem. The Lagrangian problem can thus be used in place of a linear programming relaxation to provide bounds in a branch and bound algorithm. This approach has led to dramatically improved algorithms for a number of important problems in the areas of routing, location, scheduling, assignment and set covering. This paper is a review of Lagrangian relaxation based on what has been learned in the last decade.

## 2. Real-Time Dispatch of Petroleum Tank Trucks

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
A highly automated, real-time dispatch system is described which uses embedded optimization routines to replace extensive manual operations and to reduce substantially operating costs for a nation-wide fleet of petroleum tank trucks. The system is currently used in daily operations by the Order Entry and Dispatch segment of the Chevron U.S.A. Marketing System. Refined petroleum products valued at several billion dollars per year are dispatched from more than 80 bulk terminals on a fleet exceeding 300 vehicles in approximately 2600 loads per day. Centralized use of the dispatch system required its design and implementation as a set of transaction modules within a large management information system. This environment presents special challenges for the optimization methods; an heuristic sequential network assignment was developed for certified performance on these dispatch models in lieu of their solution as integer programs. Objectives include minimizing transportation costs (approaching $100 million annually) while maintaining equitable man and equipment workload distribution, safety standards, and customer service, and satisfying equipment compatibility restrictions.

## 3. Profit Maximizing Perceptual Positions: An Integrated Theory for the Selection of Product Features and Price
### Author(s):
- John R. Hauser
- Patricia Simmie
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
An important component of marketing strategy is to position a product in perceptual space. But to realize a perceptual position we must model the link from physical characteristics to perceptual dimensions and we must use this model to maximize profit. This paper integrates psychological theories on how consumers process information with economic models and psychometric measurement, and it develops a theory for selecting physical features and price to achieve a profit maximizing perceptual position.

## 4. The Determinants of Information Value: Synthesizing Some General Results
### Author(s):
- Ronald W. Hilton
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
This paper identifies the determinants of information value and synthesizes some general results concerning their effects. While some attributes of an information system exhibit a consistent directional effect on information value, attributes of the decision setting and decision maker do not.

## 5. Comparing Operating Characteristics of Queues in Which Customers Require a Random Number of Servers
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
We examine the relative effects of several service order disciplines on important operating characteristics of queues in which customers request a random number of servers. This class of queues is characterized by customers who cannot begin service until all required servers are available. We show that for many systems in this class, it is possible to define a new service order discipline which is more efficient than FIFO with respect to one or more measures such as expected waiting time, probability of delay, etc.

## 6. Expected-Utility-Maximizing Price Search with Learning
### Author(s):
- Ronald M. Harstad
- Andrew Postlewaite
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
We consider a model of search when the distribution of prices (wages) is unknown. The effect of changing the objective function from minimizing expected cost to maximizing expected utility is examined.

## 7. Applying Classical Control Theory to Energy-Economics ModelingA Tool to Explain Model Behavior in Response to Varied Policy Decisions and Changing Inputs
### Author(s):
- B. W. Mar
- O. A. Bakken
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
Classical control theory is applied to the field of energy-economics using the Dartmount model COAL as an illustration. Control theory can assist in establishing the credibility of existing energy-economic systems models, since it presents a better understanding of model response. The application of these models requires a translation of DYNAMO type conventions into differential equations and flow diagram usually used for control system analysis. The response of the model to parameter changes and model inputs can become routine analyses using classical control theory methodology. In the case of the COAL model it was shown that the model output does not experience detectable oscillations even when input oscillations are introduced. The model as formulated represents a well damped system, which may not be what the authors expected in their representation of the real system.

## 8. The Value of Decision Making in a Complex Environment: An Experimental Approach
### Author(s):
- Robin M. Hogarth
- Spyros Makridakis
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
Are the costs of time and effort spent on analyzing decisions outweighed by benefits? This issue was examined in the context of a competitive business game where human teams were pitted against two kinds of simple-minded arbitrary decision rules: one where rules were applied consistently (arbitrary-consistent); the other where rules were subject to a random component (arbitrary-random). The arbitrary-consistent rules outperformed, on average, 41% of human opponents, the corresponding figure for arbitrary-random being 19%. These results are discussed within the more general context of consistency in decision making which has received considerable attention in both the management and psychological literatures, albeit in the more restricted case of non-competitive and stable environments. Issues raised by the study include the use of automated and controlled baseline strategies to study decision making in complex situations, the need to develop normative guidelines for use in turbulent, competitive environments, and the multidimensional nature of the functions of decision making in organizations.

## 9. NoteOn the Cyert-Davidson-Thompson Doubtful Accounts Model
### Author(s):
- Jos A. M. van Kuelen
- Jaap Spronk
- A. Wayne Corcoran
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1981
### Abstract:
The results of the classical Cyert, Davidson, and Thompson (CDT) model for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts could be made more valuable by correcting one flaw. The CDT model rests on the total balance method of aging dollars and, as presented, its answers cannot wisely be applied to estimate real dollar amounts. Notably, the steady state distributions derived by the model tend to underestimate actually paid dollar amounts.
