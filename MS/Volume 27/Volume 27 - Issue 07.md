## 1. An Investigation of the Equal Commission Rate Policy for a Multi-Product Salesforce
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
For a multi-product sales force, the policy of paying commissions as an equal percentage of realized gross margins is shown to be in general, nonoptimal from the firm's profit maximization point of view. For a homogeneous salesforce, the nonoptimality results from the fact that earlier research while taking into account the effect of commission rates on a salesperson's allocations of total time to the multiple products, has not incorporated the effect of commission rates on salesperson's total selling time (resulting from his/her trading off income vs. total time to maximize utility). The equal commission rate policy is, however, optimal for the cases of (i) salesperson with a fixed total selling time and a minimum income requirement and (ii) fair-income salesperson whose total selling time is merely a function of income (and not based on rate of change of income as in the utility maximization case). If the salesforce is heterogeneous (e.g., different salespersons have differing sales responses to selling time) this makes the equal commission rate policy to be, in general, nonoptimal even for the restrictive cases (i) and (ii). It is suggested that the commission rates be set higher for products with greater elasticities (relating quantities sold to selling times). The common practice of paying commissions as a percentage of total dollar sales (rather than gross margins) is shown to be optimal under certain assumptions.

## 2. An Experimental Investigation of the Use of Computer-Based Graphics in Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Henry C. Lucas, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
This paper presents the results of an experiment designed to investigate the impact of computer-based graphics on decision making. The experimental task consisted of selecting quarterly reorder quantities for an importer under condition of uncertain demand. Subjects in the experiment were participants in an executive program for middle and upper level managers. Each subject received information on the cumulative probability distribution of demand and had an opportunity to run up to eight trial simulations with past demand data using his or her order quantities. After completing the trial simulations, the subjects made quarterly ordering decisions for one year in which the quantities demanded were drawn from the demand distribution.

## 3. A Resource Allocation and Evaluation Model for Providing Services to the Mentally Retarded
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
Legal decisions in the mental health field, and the process of deinstitutionalization have brought about an increasingly complex system of service delivery for the mentally retarded. We present a linear programming model to assist in managing such delivery systems. The usefulness and applicability of the model has been tested in Minnesota. We discuss how the procedure can be applied elsewhere.

## 4. An Investigation of Competitive Preference Structures and Posterior Performance Through a Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Approach
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
In this paper we analyze competitive decision-making situations in terms of their preference structures and posterior performance, through a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework. The setting is that of a two-by-two, two-person, non-zero-sum and noncooperative game which is repeated over time. The dynamic behavior of the competitors for different classes of games, as identified by their preference structures, is examined and a classification scheme is proposed for the purpose of unification. The competitors' dynamic behavior and posterior performance for some general classes of games is then derived, and the relationship to the results implied from game-theoretic considerations is discussed. Illustrative examples are given, too.

## 5. Project Appraisal Methodology: A Multidimensional R&D Benefit/Cost Assessment Tool
### Author(s):
- Barry G. Silverman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
Project Appraisal Methodology (PAM) is a multidimensional, easy to use tool for assessing the relative merits of R&D projects. It requires users to estimate three vectors of economic and scoring values: energy benefits, consumer savings and societal factors. The Division of Fossil Fuel Utilization, Department of Energy implemented PAM in support of their annual R&D planning, programming and budget preparation activities for FY 1981. Illustrative results, sensitivity analyses, and model parametrics are presented. Project rank is shown to be most sensitive to life cycle cost, year of initial commercialization, and planning horizon. Model weights, on the other hand, have little effect. Results also seem to indicate that the common formulation of the resource allocation optimization problem is not appropriate in a highly uncertain environment such as energy forecasting. Finally, several potential improvements to the methodology in the present application are discussed.

## 6. A Model for Optimizing Retail Space Allocations
### Author(s):
- Marcel Corstjens
- Peter Doyle
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
The allocation of scarce shelf space among competing products is a central problem in retailing. Space allocation affects store profitability through both the demand function, where both main and cross space elasticities have to be considered, and through the cost function (procurement, carrying and out-of-stock costs). A model is developed which uniquely incorporates both effects. A case study is used to estimate the parameters and the problem is solved within a geometrical programming framework. An extensive comparison with alternative procedures suggests this general model leads to significantly different allocation rules and superior profit performance.

## 7. A Two-Stage Model for the Control of Epidemic Influenza
### Author(s):
- Stan N. Finkelstein
- Charles N. Smart
- Andrew M. Gralla
- Cecilia R. d'Oliveira
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
We developed a two-stage model to help predict the circumstances under which alternative public immunization strategies for influenza are likely to be best suited to national needs. The first stage is a deterministic epidemic model which, when solved numerically, describes the fraction of the population that becomes infective during a hypothetical epidemic. The second stage is a cost/benefit model that allows policy alternatives to be compared in economic net benefit terms. Our assumptions lead us to predict that immunization programs directed at the population at large are in some cases favored over those which target selected high-risk groups.

## 8. NoteOn An Interpretation of Fractional Objectives in Goal Programming as Related to Papers by Awerbuch et al., and Hannan
### Author(s):
- Edward L. Hannan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
This Note points out a minor error in a technique developed by Soyster and Level (Soyster, A. L., B. Lev. 1978. An interpretation of fractional objectives in goal programming as related to papers by Awerbuch et al., and Hannan. Management Sci.24 (14) 15461549.) for determining if a linear goal can be substituted for a fractional goal in a goal programming problem. A revised formulation is provided.

## 9. NoteOn a Modified One-Center Model
### Author(s):
- Zvi Drezner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1981
### Abstract:
The objective of the one-center model (single facility minimax location in the plane) is changed to be the maximum weighted number of demand points within a given weighted distance from the facility. The paper presents an O(n2 log n) algorithm for the model along with some computational experience.
