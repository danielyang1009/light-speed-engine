### Author(s):
- Vithala R. Rao
- Frederick W. Winter
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
A model that addresses the problem of selecting test units for test marketing is described. The model is based on Bayesian procedures and utilizes data on the relationships between test unit sales and equilibrium market performance. An illustrative application incorporates the use of historical data in a Bayesian decision framework.

## 2. A Bi-Extremal Principle for Frontier Estimation and Efficiency Evaluations

### Published:

### Abstract:
A new approach is supplied for locating efficiency frontiers and evaluating the efficiency of Decision Making Units (DMU's). This is accomplished from observational data by means of an envelopment procedure called DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) originally developed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper, E. Rhodes, 1978. Measuring the efficiency of decision making units. Eur. J. Oper. Res.2 (6). See also, Short communication. Eur. J. Oper. Res.3 (1979) 339.) in connection with their ratio formulation for relative efficiency measurement. The current variant employs a bi-extremal principle which, though nonlinear, is subsequently shown to be reducible to a finite sequence of linear programming problems. The development is illustrated by means of multiple output functions which are piecewise of Cobb-Douglas or general log linear type and which also allow for increasing, decreasing and constant returns to scale. More than one production function for the DMU's is also allowed. The reduction of the bi-extremal principle to linear programming equivalence is also accomplished for much more general classes of functions. A numerical example illustrates some of these ideas and also provides a springboard for a new theorem which relates these efficiency measures to ones which were supplied earlier in the Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes's work (Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper, E. Rhodes, 1978. Measuring the efficiency of decision making units. Eur. J. Oper. Res.2 (6). See also, Short communication. Eur. J. Oper. Res.3 (1979) 339.).

## 3. The Linear Fractional Portfolio Selection Problem
### Author(s):
- Bruce H. Faaland
- Nancy L. Jacob
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
A simplified portfolio selection criterion suggested by Sharpe and Mao involves choosing at most n securities from a universe of m securities in order to maximize the portfolio's excess-return-to-beta ratio. This paper examines alternative solution procedures to achieve this objective, including a gradient procedure whose continuous Knapsack subproblems in m bounded variables are solved in O(m) time. The effect on the optimal portfolio of increasing n is discussed, as well as the relationship between the excess-return-to-beta ratio of an individual security and that of the optimal portfolio. The paper concludes with computational experience on problems with n ranging from 10 to 200 and m from 500 to 1,245.

## 4. Multiple Unit Dispatches in Emergency Services: Models to Estimate System Performance
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Chelst
- Ziv Barlach
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
One emergency service system model that has undergone extensive development and testing is the hypercube queuing model and its approximate analog, which were developed by Larson. The model estimates key system performance measures, such as individual unit workloads and travel times. One limitation of this model, as well as other probabilistic deployment models, is that they assume only a single unit is dispatched to each call. In the police environment, if two officers are assigned to each unit, this assumption is generally valid. However, most fire services dispatch multiple vehicles to a serious fire, and in police departments with one-officer units, a second unit will be sent to all potentially dangerous calls.

## 5. Optimal Testing Procedures for Special Structures of Coherent Systems
### Author(s):
- Yosi Ben-Dov
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
Consider the problem of minimizing the expected cost of identifying the state of a coherent system (as functioning or failed). The system is composed of components (that either fail or work), and only individual components can be tested. Efficient algorithms are presented for some special cases of coherent systems: parallel-series, series-parallel and k-out-of-n systems. Examples are given to demonstrate the algorithms.

## 6. The Boundary Between Planning and Incremental Budgeting: Empirical Examination in a Publicly-Owned Corporation
### Author(s):
- S. K. Lioukas
- D. J. Chambers
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
This paper is a study within the field of public budgeting. It focuses on the capital budget, and it attempts to model and analyze the capital budgeting process using a framework previously developed in the literature of incremental budgeting. Within this framework the paper seeks to determine empirically whether the movement of capital expenditure budgets can be represented as the routine application of incremental adjustments over an existing base of allocations and whether further, forward-looking adjustments can be found. Its setting is a British publicly-owned corporation.

## 7. Efficiency of the Market for Racetrack Betting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
Many racetrack bettors have systems. Since the track is a market similar in many ways to the stock market one would expect that the basic strategies would be either fundamental or technical in nature. Fundamental strategies utilize past data available from racing forms, special sources, etc. to handicap races. The investor then wagers on one or more horses whose probability of winning exceeds that determined by the odds by an amount sufficient to overcome the track take. Technical systems require less information and only utilize current betting data. They attempt to find inefficiencies in the market and bet on such overlays when they have positive expected value. Previous studies and our data confirm that for win bets these inefficiencies, which exist for underbet favorites and overbet longshots, are not sufficiently great to result in positive profits. This paper describes a technical system for place and show betting for which it appears to be possible to make substantial positive profits and thus to demonstrate market inefficiency in a weak form sense. Estimated theoretical probabilities of all possible finishes are compared with the actual amounts bet to determine profitable betting situations. Since the amount bet influences the odds and theory suggests that to maximize long run growth a logarithmic utility function is appropriate the resulting model is a nonlinear program. Side calculations generally reduce the number of possible bets in any one race to three or less hence the actual optimization is quite simple. The system was tested on data from Santa Anita and Exhibition Park using exact and approximate solutions (that make the system operational at the track given the limited time available for placing bets) and found to produce substantial positive profits. A model is developed to demonstrate that the profits are not due to chance but rather to proper identification of market inefficiencies.

## 8. Minimizing Variation of Flow Time in Single Machine Systems
### Author(s):
- John J. Kanet
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of n jobs to be scheduled on a single machine in such a way that flow time variation is minimized. When the measure of variation is total absolute difference of completion times (TADC) the problem is shown to be quite simple. Sufficient conditions are shown for minimal TADC and a simple method for generating an optimal solution is provided.

## 9. NoteComments on the Complexity Rating Factor for Layout Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1981
### Abstract:
In a recently published Note, Block (Block, T. E. 1979. On the complexity of facilities layout problems. Management Sci.25 (3) 280285.) attempted to provide a definitive method to evaluate the complexity of facilities layout problems. He proposed a complexity rating factor that is based on flow dominance and the number of facilities. Mathematically, the rating factor suffers from the use of an incorrect upper bound for flow dominance. Also, there is a problem with regard to its interpretability. These shortcomings are discussed in this Note. The sensitivities of flow dominance and the rating factor to changes in a single element of the flow matrix are examined and their implications discussed.
