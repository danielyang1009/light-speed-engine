## 1. Expectations and Share Prices

### Abstract:
It is generally believed that security prices are determined by expectations concerning firm and economic variables. Despite this belief there is very little research examining expectational data. In this paper we examine how expectations concerning earning per share effect share price. We first show that knowledge concerning analyst's forecasts of earnings per share cannot by itself lead to excess returns. Any information contained in the consensus estimate of earnings per share is already included in share price. Investors or managers who buy high growth stocks where high growth is determined by consensus beliefs should not earn an excess return. This is not due to earnings having no effect upon share price since knowledge of actual earnings leads to excess return. Much larger excess returns are earned if one is able to determine those stocks for which analysts most underestimate return. Finally, the largest returns can be earned by knowing which stocks for which analysts will make the greatest revision in their estimates. This pattern of results suggests that share price is affected by expectations about earnings per share. Given any degree of forecasting ability managers can obtain best results by acting on the differences between their forecasts and concensus forecasts.

## 2. A Micromodeling Approach to Investigate the Advertising-Sales Relationship

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to derive a model of advertising effects on the firm's sales. A micromodel is postulated and aggregated across individuals and over time to produce a macromodel of the aggregate sales-advertising relationship for a single product. The micromodel postulated is very simple. It incorporates two factors: reach of the ads and rate of decay of their effectiveness over time.

## 3. Predicting Future Random Events Based on Past Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
There are many situations where one is interested in predicting the expected number of events in period 2 given that x events occurred in period 1. For example, insurance companies must decide whether or not to cancel the insurance of drivers who had 3 or more accidents during the previous year. In analyzing marketing research data an analyst may wish to predict the number of future purchases to be made by those customers who made x purchases in the previous 3 months. The owner of a baseball team may wish to estimate the number of home runs a batter will hit this year given he hit (say) 40 home runs last year. When the events (e.g., accidents, purchase occasions, home runs) can be assumed to occur randomly over time a very general result due to Robbins (Robbins, H. 1977. Prediction and estimation for the compound Poisson distribution. Proc. National Acad Sci. USA74 26702671.) is available. This approach has certain advantages and disadvantages with respect to the negative binomial model that is commonly used to analyze purchasing and accident data. The Robbins result is particularly appropriate for predicting what the zero class in period 1 will do in period 2. The main purpose of this paper is to present the Robbins result in a form that can be readily understood by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. Data on consumer purchases, motor vehicle violations and accidents are analyzed and applications to other areas are discussed.

## 4. Multiple Objective Linear Fractional Programming
### Author(s):
- Jonathan S. H. Kornbluth
- Ralph E. Steuer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
This paper presents a simplex-based solution procedure for the multiple objective linear fractional programming problem. By (1) departing slightly from the traditional notion of efficiency and (2) augmenting the feasible region as in goal programming, the solution procedure solves for all weakly efficient vertices of the augmented feasible region. The article discusses the difficulties that must be addressed in multiple objective linear fractional programming and motivates the solution algorithm that is developed.

## 5. Project Scheduling with Continuously-Divisible, Doubly Constrained Resources
### Author(s):
- Jan Wglarz
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
This paper deals with a class of project scheduling problems concerning the allocation of continuously divisible resources under conditions in which both total usage at every moment and total consumption over the period of project duration are constrained. Typical examples of such resources, called doubly constrained, are money or energy, when the constraint on power or the rate of expenditure cannot be ignored as neither, of course, can. the constraint on resource consumption. Also manpower must often be considered as a doubly constrained resource. Mathematical models of project activities in which performing speeds are continuous functions of resource amounts are considered. The objective is a schedule which minimizes project duration. Thus, the problems considered are generalizations of both the classical project scheduling problem and the time-cost trade-off problem.

## 6. A Polynomially Bounded Algorithm for a Nonlinear Network Allocation Problem
### Author(s):
- T. R. Elken
- H. T. Freedman
- A. E. Gibson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for determining the optimal allocation to demand points when the distribution system is a capacitated arborescence of N arcs and the cost (return) functions are convex (concave). It is proved that the algorithm generates an optimal solution by solving at most N(N + 1)/2 single-constraint subproblems. If the cost functions allow the Lagrange multiplier for the subproblems to be evaluated in polynomial time, then this is a polynomial algorithm. The analysis is motivated by the problem of allocating spare capacity in the loop plant portion of telephone networks.

## 7. Analysis of a Preference Order Assembly Line Problem
### Author(s):
- Moshe Sniedovich
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
An analysis is made of a preference order dynamic programming procedure proposed in the literature for stochastic assembly line balancing problems. It is shown that in general the procedure does not satisfy the monotonicity condition and that therefore there is no guarantee that the solutions will be optimal. It is also shown that for a certain class of problems for which the procedure does yield optimal solutions, the proposed preference order model can be reformulated as a regular dynamic programming model.

## 8. NoteComments on the Optimality in Optimal and System Myopic Policies for Multi-Echelon Production/Inventory Assembly Systems
### Author(s):
- Andrew Z. Szendrovits
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1981
### Abstract:
Schwarz and Schrage's model assumes that, for optimal policies in a multi-echelon production/inventory system, the lot size of a stage must not be larger than that of a predecessor stage, as lots move from the initial stage to the final stage. Examples in this Note illustrate that set-up costs and inventory holding costs may be such that optimal inventory policies exist when smaller lot sizes are produced intermittently at a stage, with an overlap, to feed the continuous production of a larger lot size at the next stage. Also, an example shows that, in contrast with another assumption in their model, optimality does not always require that the lot size at each stage be an integer multiple of the lot size at the successor stage.

### Abstract:
Communications are read for interest in issues that have importance for all who practice and use management science. They are not refereed for technical correctness, as are articles and Notes that appear in Management Science. The reader is therefore cautioned that the publication of any Communication implies neither scientific standing nor acceptance per se on the part of either Management Science or TIMS.
