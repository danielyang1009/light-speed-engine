## 1. The Sampling Relationship Between Sharpe's Performance Measure and its Risk Proxy: Sample Size, Investment Horizon and Market Conditions
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Sharpe's, Treynor's and Jensen's measures have been extensively used for the performance evaluation of mutual funds or portfolios. These three widely used performance measures have been found to be highly correlated with their corresponding risk measures by a number of empirical studies. This paper focuses the investigation on the possible sources of the bias associated with the empirical relationship between the estimated Sharpe's measure and its estimated risk measure. In general, the sample size, the investment horizon and the market conditions are three important factors in determining the strong relationship between the ex-post Sharpe's measure and its estimated risk surrogate.

## 2. Approximating a Point Process by a Renewal Process: The View Through a Queue, an Indirect Approach
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
This paper investigates simple approximations for stochastic point processes. As in several previous studies, the approximating process is a renewal process characterized by the first two moments of the renewal interval. The approximating renewal-interval distribution itself is a convenient distribution with these two moments; it is constructed from exponential building blocks, e.g., the hyperexponential distribution. Here the moments of the renewal interval are chosen to produce the same level of congestion when the renewal process serves as an arrival process in a test queueing system as is produced when the general point process is the arrival process. The procedure can be applied to predict the behavior of a new service mechanism in a queueing system with a complicated arrival process; then we use the system with the old service mechanism as the test system. But the test system can also be an artificial device to approximate any point process. This indirect approximation procedure extends the equivalent random method and related techniques widely used in teletraffic engineering.

## 3. A Nonstationary Model of Binary Choice Applied to Media Exposure
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
In the field of media research, the beta binomial has performed very well for estimating the distribution of the frequency of exposures to a media vehicle. However, long-term projections have shown consistent biases. The beta binomial geometric model, an extension of the well-known beta binomial model, which incorporates non-stationarity of individuals' exposure probabilities, is able to account for these errors. In addition this beta binomial geometric framework provides insights into the sensitivity of various media statistics to non-stationarity. This model is a particular operationalization of Howard's general Dynamic Inference Model (Howard, R. A. 1965. Dynamic inference. Oper. Res.13 (2) 712733.). The paper focuses on applications to some television viewing and magazine readership data. The properties of the model, estimation of the parameters and statistical tests are also presented. Finally, some future research possibilities are discussed.

## 4. A Branch and Bound Algorithm for the List Selection Problem in Direct Mail Advertising
### Author(s):
- F. Robert Dwyer
- James R. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
This paper describes a branch and bound approach for optimizing a media selection problem, namely, to choose the best set of mailing lists to maximize audience reach. Prompted by a national retailer's interest in more effective and efficient direct mail catalogue distribution, the algorithm exploits current heuristic approaches which improve computational efficiency. A numerical example and computational experience using actual data are discussed, along with extensions to other practical situations.

## 5. Evaluating Program and Managerial Efficiency: An Application of Data Envelopment Analysis to Program Follow Through
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- E. Rhodes
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
A model for measuring the efficiency of Decision Making Units (=DMU's) is presented, along with related methods of implementation and interpretation. The term DMU is intended to emphasize an orientation toward managed entities in the public and/or not-for-profit sectors. The proposed approach is applicable to the multiple outputs and designated inputs which are common for such DMU's. A priori weights, or imputations of a market-price-value character are not required.

## 6. Decision Problems Under Risk and Chance Constrained Programming: Dilemmas in the Transition
### Author(s):
- Andrew J. Hogan
- James G. Morris
- Howard E. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
Some important conceptual problems concerning the application of chance constrained programming (CCP) to risky practical decision problems are discussed by comparing CCP to stochastic programming with recourse (SPR). We expand on Garstka's distinction between mathematical equivalence and economic equivalence showing that much of practical usefulness is lost in the transition between SPR and CCP. By examining the literature on CCP applications we conclude that there is little evidence that CCP is used with the care that is necessary. Finally we conclude that CCP is seriously deficient as a modeling technique and of limited value as a computational device.

## 7. NoteParticipative Design of Strategic Decision Support Systems: An Empirical Assessment
### Author(s):
- William R. King
- Jamie I. Rodriguez
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1981
### Abstract:
The concept of participative systems design should be as applicable to strategic management decision support systems as it is generally believed to be to lower-level systems. This study tests hypotheses concerning participative design using data describing the participation and performance of managers prior to during, and after implementation of a participatively designed system. The study concludes that there is some effect of participation on the attitudes of participants, but no measurable effect on the amount of system usage. The nature of system use was found to be related to inputs provided in the design process by participants. No advantage was found for participants in terms of the quality of decision making.
