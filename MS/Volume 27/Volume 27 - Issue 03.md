## 1. Production and Sales Planning with Limited Shared Tooling at the Key Operation

### Published:

### Abstract:
The focus of this paper is multiperiod production and sales planning when there is a single dominant production operation for which tooling (dies, molds, etc.) can be shared among parts and is limited in availability. Our interest in such problems grew out of management issues confronting an injection molding manufacturer of plastic pipes and fittings for the building and chemical industries, but similar problems abound in the manufacture of many other cast, extruded, molded, pressed, or stamped products. We describe the development and successful application of a planning model and an associated computational approach for this class of problems. The problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program. Lagrangean relaxation is applied so as to exploit the availability of highly efficient techniques for minimum cost network flow problems and for single-item dynamic lot-sizing type problems. For the practical application at hand, provably good solutions are routinely being obtained in modest computing time to problems far beyond the capabilities of available mathematical programming systems.

## 2. Comparison among Certain Inspection Policies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
Certain continuous production processes and early warning systems must be inspected in order to detect failures that would otherwise not be apparent. An optimal inspection policy is a sequence of inspection times which minimizes the average cost per inspection cycle relative to some cost model. Under both an existing cost model, and a new cost model proposed in this paper, the computation of such policies is difficult. Three sub-optimal inspection policies are proposed, each, like the optimal policy, having decreasing times between successive inspections when the time to system failure has increasing hazard rate.

## 3. A Decision Process Model of R&D Resource Allocation in Hierarchical Organizations

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is presented which incorporates many descriptive characteristics of decentralized R&D resource allocation processes. In general it is a member of the class of models referred to as decision process models. In specific it is representative of an R&D resource allocation process involving a number of subunits at three hierarchical levels. An important feature is the model's ability to represent a number of different interlevel information and organizational coordination mechanisms relating subordinate to ordinate and ordinate to superordinate. A series of 01 goal programs with preemptive priority factors provide models for each of the subunits. The subunit models are linked through very general information flows. R&D project or portfolio characteristics are passed upward; while R&D goals and/or budgets and associated levels are passed downward. The eventual purpose of this research is to construct a simulator capability suitable for experimentation concerning coordination in a decentralized resource allocation process involving R&D projects. Such a capability would be an important tool for analyzing existing or proposed decision processes and would be useful for policy analysis at the level of both the firm and the federal government. An illustrative experiment is discussed.

## 4. The Marketing Channel as an Equilibrium Set of Contracts
### Author(s):
- Pinhas Zusman
- Michael Etgar
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
Nash bargaining theory and recent developments in economic contract theory are employed in the analysis of the marketing channels. Individual dyadic contracts involving payment schedules between members of a simple 3 level channel are investigated with particular reference to monitoring problems and intrachannel power relations. The interrelations between individual contracts are examined and the equilibrium set of contracts constituting the channel derived. The performance of the channel in terms of risk sharing, allocative efficiency and the distribution of gains is then evaluated. It is found that the risk aversion of channel members and the cost of monitoring and enforcement affect channel efficiency, and that under certain types of interdependencies and externalities, the nature of the power structure is crucial to channel efficiency.

## 5. A Theory of Optimal Agenda Design
### Author(s):
- Richard D. McKelvey
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
This paper formalizes the problem of designing optimal agendas for voting over finite alternative spaces, when voters are assumed to be naive, (i.e., they do not vote strategically). The class of agendas considered here is quite broad, and includes, as special cases, such methods as pairwise voting, sequential and elimination procedures, partitioning schemes, and all binary procedures. Given individual preferences over the basic alternative space, and various assumptions about how individuals choose between subsets of alternatives, one can then formalize the problem of designing agendas as a dynamic programming problem and solve for optimal agendas, i.e., agendas having either the highest probability of leading to a given alternative or having the highest expected utility to the agenda setter. Illustrations are given showing how the methods can be applied in specific examples.

## 6. A Perspective on the Use of Control Variables to Increase the Efficiency of Monte Carlo Simulations
### Author(s):
- S. S. Lavenberg
- P. D. Welch
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
This is a survey paper on the application of control variables to increase the efficiency of discrete event simulations. The emphasis is on the practical problems and potential of applying the method in the simulation of complex systems. The basic theory of control variables is reviewed and the equivalence of control variables and multiple estimators is discussed. Techniques for generating control variables are described. Inefficiencies resulting from the statistical estimation of control variable coefficients and the problem of confidence interval generation are treated. This is done both within the context of the method of independent replications and the regenerative method. The application literature is reviewed and the conditions under which control variables could be profitably applied in practical simulations are described. Finally, there is a set of recommended directions for future research.

## 7. Heuristic Techniques for Simultaneous Scheduling of Production and Distribution in Multi-Echelon Structures: Theory and Empirical Comparisons
### Author(s):
- Jack F. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
Seven heuristic algorithms are discussed. Each can be used for production scheduling in an assembly network (a network where each work station has at most one immediate successor work station, but may have any number of immediate predecessor work stations), distribution scheduling in an arborescence network (a network where each warehouse or stocking point is supplied by at most one immediate predecessor stocking point, but may itself supply any number of immediate successor stocking points), and joint production-distribution scheduling in a conjoined assembly-arborescence network. The objective of each algorithm is to determine a production and/or product distribution schedule which satisfies final product demand and minimizes the sum of the average inventory holding costs and average fixed charges for processing (ordering, delivery, or setup costs), per period, over an infinite planning horizon. Exogenous demand for product is assumed to be deterministic, at a constant rate, and to occur only at retail facilities of the networks. On the basis of their performance in 11,000 computer generated problems, the seven heuristic methods are compared with each other and with a dynamic programming algorithm. The results indicate that for most of the network structures considered, the best heuristic is the method of steepest descent; the second best is a simple extension of a method originally developed by Crowston, Wagner, and Henshaw. The improved myopic procedure of Graves and Schwarz performs very well for some particular types of structures. Surprisingly, two particularly naive heuristics also perform quite well in certain situations. In addition to the computer simulation experiments, we also discuss a simple computer-compatible algebraic notation scheme for identifying structure (facility interrelationships) within networks of the three types considered.

## 8. A Survey of Methods for Pure Nonlinear Integer Programming
### Author(s):
- Mary W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1981
### Abstract:
The subject of this paper is a classification and discussion of algorithms for solution of nonlinear pure integer programming problems. The survey is organized by characterizing the mathematical form of the nonlinear optimization problems addressed by the various algorithms. If any method can be used without changes to solve mixed integer nonlinear programming problems that fact is mentioned in the description of the algorithm. However algorithms which must be applied only to mixed integer problems are not surveyed.
