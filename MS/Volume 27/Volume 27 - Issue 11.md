### Abstract:
In a decision-making problem where a group will receive an uncertain payoff which must be divided among the members of the group, the ultimate payoff of interest is the vector of individual payoffs received by the members of the group. In this paper, preferences are quantified in terms of cardinal utility functions for such vectors of payoffs. These utility functions can represent preferences concerning equitable and inequitable vectors of payoffs as well as attitudes toward risk. The individual utility functions are aggregated to form a group utility function for the vector of payoffs, and this latter function is, in turn, used to generate a group utility function for the overall group payoff and a sharing rule for dividing the group payoff into individual payoffs. The resulting group decisions are Pareto optimal in utility space. Properties of the sharing rule and the group utility function are investigated for additive and multilinear group utility functions.

## 2. Operating Characteristics of an Inventory System with Rationing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
This paper considers an inventory system which maintains stock to meet both high and low priority demands. This model is suggested by the operation of a spare parts pool in a military depot: high priority demands are those which might result in the grounding of an aircraft, for example, while low priority demands are those which arise from the routine restocking of base level inventories. We analyze the following type of control policy: there is a support level, say K > 0, such that when the level of on hand stock reaches K, all low priority demands are backordered while high priority demands continue to be filled. Both continuous review and periodic review systems are considered. The objective of the analysis is to develop methods for comparing fill rates when there is rationing and when there is no rationing for specified values of the reorder point, order quantity and support level.

## 3. Sources of Job Related Ambiguity and Their Consequences Upon Salespersons' Job Satisfaction and Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
This study presents a conceptual model relating four sources of job related ambiguity and two individual difference variables (locus of control and need for clarity) to salesperson job satisfaction and job performance. Previous research related to the model is briefly reviewed. Then, drawing data from a multicompany sample of industrial salespersons and their managers, behavioral research methods are used to clarify the nature and strength of the relationships in the model. The analysis reveals that ambiguity concerning family expectations is positively related to performance, but ambiguity regarding sales manager and customer expectations is negatively related to performance. Lower levels of satisfaction are explained primarly by ambiguous managerial expectations. The individual difference variables are shown to be related to job outcomes even after adjusting for different levels of perceived ambiguity. The individual difference variables, however, do not moderate the relationships between sources of ambiguity and job outcomes.

## 4. Theme Appreciation as a Construct for Organizational Change
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Keidel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
This paper develops an organizational change construct from the activities of the Jamestown (New York) Area Labor-Management Committee, a community-based program of labor-management cooperation. As part of this program, projects to increase productivity and to improve the quality of working life were undertaken by internal labor-management committees in ten factories over a four-year period. Although each organizational experience was episodic, these efforts collectively gave rise to community themessuch as skills development, gains-sharing, and layout redesignwhich served to stimulate further organizational change, often in unanticipated ways. Diffusion typically was from part of one organization to part of another, rather than from a part, to the whole, of the same organization.

## 5. Contingencies for Interdisciplinary Research: Matching Research Questions with Research Organizations
### Author(s):
- Philip H. Birnbaum
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
The conditions under which interdisciplinary research helps improve research performance are explored in a heterogeneous sample of 67 ongoing academic interdisciplinary teams from the United States and Canada. We conclude that interdisciplinary research is more appropriate for very difficult research questions and at early stages of the research process. Interdisciplinary research was found to inhibit the outputs of articles, books, papers, and technical reports when the research had a clearly identified client prior to the start of the project. Interdisciplinary research was not found to be more helpful for either applied or pure research. It was not found to be helpful either at the concluding stage of research or when used throughout the research process.

- Jean-Louis Malouin
- Jol Rahn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
This paper summarizes an actual study conducted for the State Planning Organization of Turkey with the objective of formulating a national R&D policy, the implementation of which will contribute to the realization of the national goals stated in the development plans of the country. The study consists of three complementary substudies: (i) a continuous simulation model for evaluating national technology policy, (ii) an industrial survey to determine the structure of technology employed in production units, (iii) a plan for R&D activities in the iron and steel industry. A macro-to-micro and micro-to-macro approach was used in conducting the study in order to base the concepts on the facts and to find the facts based on the concepts.

## 7. An Evolutionary Strategy for Implementing a Decision Support System
### Author(s):
- Maryam Alavi
- John C. Henderson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
This paper investigates two alternative strategies for implementing Decision Support Systems (DSS): evolutionary and traditional. The evolutionary approach utilizes judgement modeling (boot strapping) as a means to create felt need, to provide insight into the decision process and the implied weighting of decision variables, and to establish a learning-based, participatory implementation strategy. In contrast, the traditional approach is characterized by a problem solving orientation wherein the DSS is portrayed as providing a valuable product that can be theoretically justified.

## 9. Managerial Strategic Behavior in State-Owned EnterprisesBusiness and Political Orientations
### Author(s):
- Jehiel Zif
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
Two different functions, managing the business in the product or service markets and managing public support in the political markets, must be performed by managers of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Each organization has to strike a strategic balance between these two functions. The way this is done is indicative of the organizational orientation and behavior. The greater the relative emphasis on managing public support, the stronger is the political orientation in our terminology. The greater the relative emphasis on managing the business, the stronger is the business orientation.

## 10. NotePerformance Evaluation of State-Owned Enterprises: A Process Perspective
### Author(s):
- Yair Aharoni
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1981
### Abstract:
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have become important instruments of social and economic policy in industrialized mixed economies and in developing countries. The use of SOEs as instruments of public policy and the resulting clashes between these enterprises and private firms on the one hand and government and other controllers on the other, are causing concern. Public committees in different countries as well as international organizations have been searching for positive theory for guidance in handling the multitude of problems related to these enterprises. Theoretical models have made important contributions to the formalization of certain problems and the classification of the information needed to solve them. Unfortunately, these theoretical models have had little relevance for the solution of important real problems.
