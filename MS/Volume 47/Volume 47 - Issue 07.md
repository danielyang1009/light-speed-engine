## 1. Shared-Savings Contracts for Indirect Materials in Supply Chains: Channel Profits and Environmental Impacts

### Abstract:
There are many materials for which the quantity needed by a firm is at best indirectly related to the quantity of final product produced by that firm, such as solvents in manufacturing processes or office supplies. For any such “indirect” materials, an inescapable incentive conflict exists: The buyer wishes to minimize consumption of these indirect materials, while the supplier's profits depend on increasing volume. Both buyer and supplier can exert effort to reduce consumption, hence making the overall supply chain more efficient. However, no supplier will voluntarily participate unless contract terms are fundamentally revised. This can be done through a variety of “shared-savings” contracts, where both parties profit from a consumption reduction. This paper analyzes several such contracts currently in use for chemicals purchasing. We show that such contracts can always increase supply-chain profits but need not lead to reduced consumption. We analyze equilibrium effort levels, consumption, and total profits, and show how these change with the contract parameters. We find that the goals of maximizing joint profits and minimizing consumption are generally not aligned. Also, surprisingly, a decrease in a cost parameter can lead to a decrease in profits; it may be necessary (but is always possible) to renegotiate the shared-savings contract to reap the benefits of a cost decrease.

## 2. Cutting Corners and Working Overtime: Quality Erosion in the Service Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
The erosion of service quality throughout the economy is a frequent concern in the popular press. The American Customer Satisfaction Index for services fell in 2000 to 69.4%, down 5 percentage points from 1994. We hypothesize that the characteristics of services—inseparability, intangibility, and labor intensity—interact with management practices to bias service providers toward reducing the level of service they deliver, often locking entire industries into a vicious cycle of eroding service standards. To explore this proposition we develop a formal model that integrates the structural elements of service delivery. We use econometric estimation, interviews, observations, and archival data to calibrate the model for a consumer-lending service center in a major bank in the United Kingdom. We find that temporary imbalances between service capacity and demand interact with decision rules for effort allocation, capacity management, overtime, and quality aspirations to yield permanent erosion of the service standards and loss of revenue. We explore policies to improve performance and implications for organizational design in the service sector.

## 3. Optimal Pricing That Coordinates Queues with Customer-Chosen Service Requirements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
This article considers the problem of coordinating the admission rates and service requirements of a multiclass queue when these decisions are made on a decentralized basis. The customer classes are characterized by different demand patterns, delay costs, and service costs. Customers make individual decisions on whether to join the queue and, if so, their service requirements. Their class identities and service requirements are private information not known to the system manager. We develop a two-stage decision framework to analyze the problem and characterize the optimal admission rates and service requirements under both centralized and decentralized assumptions. We distinguish admission and service externality costs that lead to suboptimal performance under decentralized control. For a given service discipline, we derive optimal class-specific pricing schemes that can coordinate the system when only service requirements but not class identities are unobservable. When customer class identities are also unobservable, we consider two common service disciplines that offer undifferentiated service: processor sharing and first-come-first-served. Based on the general framework, for the M/G/s processor sharing queue, we show that a single variable fee (payment per unit of time in the system) can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. For the M/G/1 first-come-first-served queue, we show that a single pricing scheme that is quadratic in time in service can induce the optimal admission rates and service requirements for all customer classes. Our result demonstrates that, under suitable conditions, simple and undifferentiated pricing can coordinate complex queueing systems with heterogeneous customer classes.

## 4. Comparative Reliability of Verdicts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of evaluating the reliability of a verdict given by a panel of judges. Given no information other than the number of panelists for and against, we address the question of when is a verdict that was obtained by a majority of k1 vs. j1 more or less reliable than one reached by k2 vs. j2. We define criteria and investigate which verdicts are comparable and which are not. Consequences of this study may have bearing on choice of panel size and decision rule for decision-making bodies, such as courts, juries, committees, and boards. As implied by the above, our perspective is a posterior view of reliability, though it also entails prior concern regarding how the reliability of a verdict will be perceived after being delivered. As an example, we apply our results to comparing the reliability of different verdicts handed down by the Supreme Court of the State of Israel and assessing the option of expanding a hearing on a case from a bench of three judges to a larger panel.

## 5. Pricing and Hedging Path-Dependent Options Under the CEV Process
### Author(s):
- Dmitry Davydov
- Vadim Linetsky
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
Much of the work on path-dependent options assumes that the underlying asset price follows geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility. This paper uses a more general assumption for the asset price process that provides a better fit to the empirical observations. We use the so-called constant elasticity of variance (CEV) diffusion model where the volatility is a function of the underlying asset price. We derive analytical formulae for the prices of important types of path-dependent options under this assumption. We demonstrate that the prices of options, which depend on extrema, such as barrier and lookback options, can be much more sensitive to the specification of the underlying price process than standard call and put options and show that a financial institution that uses the standard geometric Brownian motion assumption is exposed to significant pricing and hedging errors when dealing in path-dependent options.

## 6. Competition and Structure in Serial Supply Chains with Deterministic Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
Supply chains often consist of several tiers, with different numbers of firms competing at each tier. A major determinant of the structure of supply chains is the cost structure associated with the underlying manufacturing process. In this paper, we examine the impact of fixed and variable costs on the structure and competitiveness of supply chains with a serial structure and price-sensitive linear deterministic demand. The entry stage is modeled as a simultaneous game, where the players take the outcomes of the subsequent post-entry (Cournot) competition into account in making their entry decisions. We derive expressions for prices and production quantities as functions of the number of entrants at each tier of a multitier chain. We characterize viability and stability of supply-chain structures and show, using lattice arguments, that there is always an equilibrium structure in pure strategies in the entry game. Finally, we examine the effects of vertical integration in the two-tier case. Altogether, the paper provides a framework for comparing a variety of supply-chain structures and for studying how they are affected by cost structures and by the number of entrants throughout the chain.

## 7. Future Capacity Procurements Under Unknown Demand and Increasing Costs
### Author(s):
- Apostolos Burnetas
- Stephen Gilbert
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
In this paper we study a situation in which a broker must manage the procurement of a short-life-cycle product. As the broker observes demand for the item, she learns about the demand process. However, as is often the case in practice, it becomes either more difficult or more expensive to procure the item as the selling season advances. Thus, the broker must trade off higher procurement costs against the benefit of making ordering decisions with better information about demand. Problems of this type arise, for example, in the travel industry, where a travel agent's cost of procuring airline and hotel reservations increases as the date of a vacation package approaches. We develop a newsvendor-like characterization of the optimal procurement policy. In a numerical analysis, we demonstrate how broker procurements tend to cluster just before price increases and how brokers can benefit from explicitly considering the effects of information about demand in their ordering policies.

### Abstract:
In spite of the remarkable improvements in the quality of general purpose mixed-integer programming software, the effective solution of a variety of lot-sizing problems depends crucially on the development of tight formulations for the special problem features occurring in practice.

## 9. Solving the Cell Suppression Problem on Tabular Data with Linear Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2001
### Abstract:
Cell suppression is a widely used technique for protecting sensitive information in statistical data presented in tabular form. Previous works on the subject mainly concentrate on 2- and 3-dimensional tables whose entries are subject to marginal totals. In this paper we address the problem of protecting sensitive data in a statistical table whose entries are linked by a generic system of linear constraints. This very general setting covers, among others, k-dimensional tables with marginals as well as the so-called hierarchical and linked tables that are very often used nowadays for disseminating statistical data. In particular, we address the optimization problem known in the literature as the (secondary) Cell Suppression Problem, in which the information loss due to suppression has to be minimized. We introduce a new integer linear programming model and outline an enumerative algorithm for its exact solution. The algorithm can also be used as a heuristic procedure to find near-optimal solutions. Extensive computational results on a test-bed of 1,160 real-world and randomly generated instances are presented, showing the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, we were able to solve to proven optimality 4-dimensional tables with marginals as well as linked tables of reasonable size (to our knowledge, tables of this kind were never solved optimally by previous authors).
