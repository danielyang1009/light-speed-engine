## 1. Technology Regimes and New Firm Formation
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
At least since Schumpeter (1934 and 1942), researchers have been interested in identifying the dimensions of technology regimes that facilitate new firm formation as a mode of technology exploitation. Using data on 1,397 patents assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1980-1996 period, I show that four hypothesized dimensions of the technology regime—the age of the technical field, the tendency of the market toward segmentation, the effectiveness of patents, and the importance of complementary assets in marketing and distribution—influence the likelihood that new technology will be exploited through firm formation.

### Abstract:
We examine the relationship between quality, represented by consumer ratings, and quality-related activities by the customer, represented by maintenance activities in the automotive industry. Based on several converging theoretical perspectives, we present and test a model relating vehicle initial quality ratings to consumers' routine maintenance. Three types of data were collected for the study: (1) vehicle service records at a local dealership, (2) primary data from a survey of vehicle owners, and (3) Consumer Reports data on quality ratings and initial purchase prices. The results of a structural equation analysis of the proposed model indicate a significant link between quality and customers' quality behavior. This link has important strategic implications for both automotive manufacturers and distributors, particularly as “leasing” becomes more prevalent in the industry.

- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
There has been an extensive research literature on auctions, but recent developments in technology have resulted in new interest in auction mechanisms as a practical way of allocating resources. This paper presents a new double-auction mechanism to handle resource allocation for public goods when complementarity exists.

## 4. Channel Coordination Under Price Protection, Midlife Returns, and End-of-Life Returns in Dynamic Markets
### Author(s):
- Terry A. Taylor
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
This paper examines three channel policies that are used in declining price environments: Price protection (P) is a mechanism under which the manufacturer pays the retailer a credit applying to the retailer's unsold inventory when the wholesale price drops during the life cycle; midlife returns (M) allow the retailer to return units partway through the life cycle at some rebate; and end-of-life returns (E) allow the retailer to return unsold units at the end of the life cycle. Under declining retail prices, if the wholesale prices and the return rebates are set properly, then EM (i.e., midlife and end-of-life returns) achieves channel coordination. However, such a policy may not be implementable because it may require the manufacturer to be worse off as a result of coordination. If P is used in addition to EM and the terms are set properly, then PEM guarantees both coordination and a win-win outcome. If the retail price is constant over time, then EM is sufficient to guarantee both coordination and a win-win outcome.

## 5. Representing and Solving Decision Problems with Limited Information
### Author(s):
- Steffen L. Lauritzen
- Dennis Nilsson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
We introduce the notion of LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID) to describe multistage decision problems in which the traditional assumption of no forgetting is relaxed. This can be relevant in situations with multiple decision makers or when decisions must be prescribed under memory constraints, such as in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We give an algorithm for improving any given strategy by local computation of single policy updates and investigate conditions for the resulting strategy to be optimal.

## 6. Gale-Shapley Stable Marriage Problem Revisited: Strategic Issues and Applications
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
We study strategic issues in the Gale-Shapley stable marriage model. In the first part of the paper, we derive the optimal cheating strategy and show that it is not always possible for a woman to recover her women-optimal stable partner from the men-optimal stable matching mechanism when she can only cheat by permuting her preferences. In fact, we show, using simulation, that the chances that a woman can benefit from cheating are slim. In the second part of the paper, we consider a two-sided matching market found in Singapore. We study the matching mechanism used by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the placement of primary six students in secondary schools, and discuss why the current method has limited success in accommodating the preferences of the students, and the specific needs of the schools (in terms of the “mix” of admitted students). Using insights from the first part of the paper, we show that stable matching mechanisms are more appropriate in this matching market and explain why the strategic behavior of the students need not be a major concern.

## 7. Analysis of a Forecasting-Production-Inventory System with Stationary Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
We consider a production stage that produces a single item in a make-to-stock manner. Demand for finished goods is stationary. In each time period, an updated vector of demand forecasts over the forecast horizon becomes available for use in production decisions. We model the sequence of forecast update vectors using the Martingale model of forecast evolution developed by Graves et al. (1986, 1998) and Heath and Jackson (1994). The production stage is modeled as a single-server, discrete-time, continuous-state queue. We focus on a modified base-stock policy incorporating forecast information and use an approximate analysis rooted in heavy traffic theory and random walk theory to obtain a closed-form expression for the (forecast-corrected) base-stock level that minimizes the expected steady-state inventory holding and backorder costs. This expression, which is shown to be accurate under certain conditions in a simulation study, sheds some light on the interrelationships among safety stock, stochastic correlated demand, inaccurate forecasts, and random and capacitated production in forecasting-production-inventory systems.

## 8. Warranty Signalling and Reputation
### Author(s):
- Subramanian Balachander
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
In this paper, we present a signalling-based explanation for the empirical phenomenon that a longer warranty may be offered by a product with lower quality. Our explanation hinges on differences in consumer knowledge about reliability of established and newer products. In a product market where a new entrant competes with an established product, we show that signalling behavior leads to an outcome where the less reliable product may carry the longer warranty.

## 9. An Optimization Model for the Simultaneous Operational Flight and Pilot Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Mirela Stojković
- François Soumis
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
This paper describes and solves the operational pilot scheduling problem for one day of operations. The problem consists in simultaneously modifying, as necessary, the existing flight departure schedules and planned individual work days (duties) while keeping planned aircraft itineraries unchanged. It requires the covering of all flights from one day of operations with available pilots while minimizing changes in both the flight schedule and the next day's planned duties. The newly constructed personalized duties must not exceed the maximum duty duration. Flight precedence constraints, coming from existing fixed aircraft itineraries, must be respected as well. The problem is mathematically formulated as an integer nonlinear multicommodity network flow model with time windows and additional constraints. To solve the problem, a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition combined with a branch-and-bound method has been used. The master problem comprises the flight-covering constraints and a new set of flight precedence constraints. Subproblems consisting of time-constrained shortest-path problems with linear time costs are solved by a specialized dynamic-programming algorithm. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on several input data sets. All of them have been successfully solved in very short computational time.

## 10. A Note on Stock Replenishment and Shipment Scheduling for Vendor-Managed Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Sven Axsäter
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2001
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Cetinkaya and Lee (2000) model integrated inventory control and shipment scheduling in connection with vendor-managed inventory (VMI). The model is optimized by an approximate technique. This note provides a simple procedure for exact optimization, and illustrates that the errors when using the suggested approximate technique may be very large for certain types of problems. We also suggest a new approximation and an adjustment that can be used to improve both the original and new heuristic.
