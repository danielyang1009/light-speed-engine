### Abstract:
This paper considers a health-care delivery system with two noncooperative parties: a purchaser of medical services and a specialized provider. A dynamic principal-agent model that captures the interaction between the two parties is developed. In this model, patients arrive exogenously, receive periodic treatment from the provider, suffer costly complications that require hospital care, and eventually exit the system in death. The provider chooses the intensity of treatment in each period, incurs an associated cost, and is reimbursed by the purchaser according to observed patient outcomes. The purchaser's problem is to determine a payment system that will induce treatment choices maximizing total social welfare. The optimal payment system, referred to as the outcomes-adjusted payment system, is identified. It consists of a prospective payment per patient and a retrospective payment adjustment based on adverse short-term patient outcomes. This system induces the most efficient delivery of medical services by combining the immediate “threat” of a retrospective payment adjustment with the future reward of prospective payments generated by surviving patients. A numerical example is provided in the context of Medicare's End-Stage Renal Disease program. The example compares the optimal system to systems that are currently in place. The results suggest that the purchaser can achieve significant gains in patient life expectancy by switching to the outcomes-adjusted payment system, but this requires accurate information about treatment technology, patient characteristics, and provider preferences. The life-expectancy gains do not involve increased medical expenditures.

### Abstract:
This paper examines learning curves in the health care setting to determine whether organizations achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates. Although extensive research has shown that cumulative experience leads to performance improvement across numerous contexts, the question of how much of this improvement is due to mere experience and how much is due to collective learning processes has received little attention. We argue that organizational learning processes may allow some organizations to benefit more than others from equivalent levels of experience. We thus propose that learning curves can vary across organizations engaged in the same “learning task,” due to organizational learning effects. To investigate this proposition, we investigate cardiac surgery departments implementing a new technology for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Data on operative procedure times from a sample of 660 patients who underwent the new operation at 16 different institutions are analyzed. The results confirm that cumulative experience is a significant predictor of learning, and further reveal that the slope of the learning curve varies significantly across organizations. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.

## 3. Procurement Planning to Maintain Both Short-Term Adaptiveness and Long-Term Perspective

### Abstract:
We study the fuel procurement problem for electrical utilities under uncertain demand and market price. Long-term contractual supply commitments are made at a set price with fuel suppliers at the beginning of each year. Each month the procurement planner can use fuel from these contracts or purchase fuel at the current market price. Motivated by practical insights from this market, we propose a two-phase dynamic procedure to determine a procurement plan. In the first phase, the minimum contract purchases for each month are determined at the beginning of the year. In the second phase, given the minimum contract purchases, the more detailed procurement decisions are determined at the beginning of each month with the most up-to-date information. We perform intensive computational experiments that show that this procedure produces high-quality solutions comparable to a rolling-horizon stochastic-programming heuristic, is easier to maintain and generalize, is computationally faster, and is robust to random fluctuations in demand requirements, spot market prices, and other sources of uncertainty.

## 4. Implementable Mechanisms to Coordinate Horizontal Alliances

### Abstract:
Unprecedented changes in the economics of interaction, mainly as a result of advances in information and telecommunication technologies such as the Internet, are causing a shift toward more networked forms of organizations such as horizontal alliances—that is, alliances among firms in similar businesses that have positive externalities between them. Because the success of such horizontal alliances depends crucially on aligning individual alliance-member incentives with those of the alliance as a whole, it is important to find coordination mechanisms that achieve this alignment and are simple-to-implement. In this paper, we examine two simple coordination mechanisms for a horizontal alliance characterized by the following features: (i) firms in the alliance can exert effort only in their “local” markets to increase customer demand for the alliance; (ii) customers are mobile and a customer living in a given alliance member's local area may have a need to buy from some other alliance member; and (iii) the coordination rules followed by the alliance determine which firms from a large pool of potential member-firms join the alliance, and how much effort each firm joining the alliance exerts in its local market. In this horizontal alliance setup, we consider the use of two coordination mechanisms: (i) a linear transfer of fees between members if demand from one member's local customer is served by another member, and (ii) ownership of an equal share of the alliance profits generated from a royalty on each member's sales. We derive conditions on the distribution of demand externalities among alliance members to determine when each coordination mechanism should be used separately, and when the mechanisms should be used together.

## 5. A Multiple Attribute Utility Theory Approach to Ranking and Selection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2001
### Abstract:
Managers of large industrial projects often measure performance by multiple attributes. For example, our paper is motivated by the simulation of a large industrial project called a land seismic survey, in which project performance is based on duration, cost, and resource utilization. To address these types of problems, we develop a ranking and selection procedure for making comparisons of systems (e.g., project configurations) that have multiple performance measures. The procedure combines multiple attribute utility theory with statistical ranking and selection to select the best configuration from a set of possible configurations using the indifference-zone approach. We apply our procedure to results generated by the simulator for a land seismic survey that has six performance measures, and describe a particular type of sensitivity analysis that can be used as a robustness check.

## 6. The Nonstationary Staff-Planning Problem with Business Cycle and Learning Effects
### Author(s):
- Edward G. Anderson, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2001
### Abstract:
Managing highly skilled employees is extremely complex because of the need to balance the costs and time lags associated with their training against the need to meet demand as quickly as possible. Unlike previous approaches to this problem in the staffing literature, this paper develops an optimal staffing policy at the strategic level to cope with nonstationary stochastic demand for a staff characterized by unproductive apprentice employees and fully productive experienced employees. The paper then explores the implications of this policy in different industries, using empirical data. Aside from the optimal policy, this paper's primary results include: (1) demand volatility reduces average productivity, most especially under conditions of low (or slightly negative) growth and—nonintuitively—low employee turnover or knowledge obsolescence rates; (2) there is a trade-off between meeting demand and high productivity; (3) firms with longer business cycles should smooth their hiring and firing policies; and (4) firms in industries with longer training times should smooth their hiring and firing policies. The paper also explores the possible rewards from reducing training times and turnover rates. Finally, it discusses managerial implications and possible future directions in research.

## 7. A Polyhedral Approach to Simplified Crew Scheduling and Vehicle Scheduling Problems

### Abstract:
Crew and vehicle scheduling are fundamental issues in public transit management. Informally, they can be described as the problem of determining the optimal duties for a set of crews (e.g., bus drivers) or vehicles (e.g., buses) so as to cover a given set of timetabled trips, satisfying a number of constraints laid down by the union contract and company regulations. We consider the simplified but still NP-hard case in which several depots are specified, and limits on both the total time between the start and the end of any duty (spread time) and the total duty operational time (working time) are imposed. We give a 0-1 linear programming formulation based on binary variables associated with trip transitions, which applies to both crew and vehicle scheduling. The model is enhanced by means of new families of valid inequalities, for which exact and heuristic separation procedures are proposed. These techniques are embedded into an exact branch-and-cut algorithm, which also incorporates heuristic procedures. The performance of two implementations of the method (for vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling, respectively) are evaluated through computational testing on both random and real-world test problems from the literature.

## 8. A Tabu-Search Heuristic for the Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem with Set-up Carryover

### Abstract:
This paper presents a tabu-search heuristic for the capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP) with set-up carryover. This production-planning problems allows multiple items to be produced within a time period, and setups for items to be carried over from one period to the next. Two interrelated decisions, sequencing and lot sizing, are present in this problem. Our tabu-search heuristic consists of five basic move types—three for the sequencing decisions and two for the lot-sizing decisions. We allow infeasible solutions to be generated at a penalty during the course of the search. We use several search strategies, such as dynamic tabu list, adaptive memory, and self-adjusting penalties, to strengthen our heuristic. We also propose a lower-bounding procedure to estimate the quality of our heuristic solution. We have also modified our heuristic to produce good solutions for the CLSP without set-up carryover. The computational study, conducted on a set of 540 test problems, indicates that on average our heuristic solutions are within 12% of a bound on optimality. In addition, for the set of test problems our results indicate an 8% reduction in total cost through set-up carryover.

## 9. A Nested Decomposition Approach to a Three-Stage, Two-Dimensional Cutting-Stock Problem
### Author(s):
- François Vanderbeck
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2001
### Abstract:
We consider the cutting of rectangular order pieces into stock pieces of specified width and length. The cutting process involves three stages of orthogonal guillotine cutting: Stock pieces are cut into sections that are cut into slits that are cut into order pieces. Restrictions imposed on the cutting process make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex, but limit the scope of solution space. The objective of the problem is mainly to minimize waste, but our model also accounts for other issues such as aging stock pieces, urgent or optional orders, and fixed setup costs. Our solution approach involves a nested decomposition of the problem and the recursive use of the column-generation technique: We use a column-generation formulation of the problem (Gilmore and Gomory 1965) and the cutting-pattern—generation subproblem is itself solved using a column-generation algorithm. LP-based lower bounds on the minimum cost are computed and, by rounding the LP solution, a feasible solution and associated upper bound is obtained. This approach could in principle be used in a branch-and-bound search to solve the problem to optimality. We report computational results for industrial instances. The algorithm is being used in industry as a production-planning tool.
