## 1. Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation
### Author(s):
- Scott Shane
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
Research on the creation of new high-technology companies has typically focused either on industry-level factors such as market structure and technology regime or on individual-level factors such as the work experience of entrepreneurs. This study complements these approaches by examining the effect of technological opportunities on firm formation. In particular, the study shows that the probability that an invention will be commercialized through firm formation is influenced by its importance, radicalness, and patent scope.

## 2. Exploiting a Cost Advantage and Coping with a Cost Disadvantage

### Abstract:
This paper provides an empirical investigation of how firms with cost advantages (cost disadvantages) exploit (cope with) their advantages (disadvantages) through their pricing behavior. Guided by microeconomic theory and insights from the industrial organization literature, we develop testable implications about the effect of industry structure and firm-specific characteristics on the pass-through elasticity: The rate at which changes in a firm's cost relative to competitors translates into changes in the firm's price relative to competitors. We test these implications using data from the PIMS Competitive Strategy database. The results indicate that a firm's pass-through elasticity systematically depends on whether the firm operates in a commodity or noncommodity industry, the firm's capacity utilization, and its cost and quality position in its industry. The pass-through elasticity is also shown to depend in a nonlinear way on market concentration.

## 3. Systemic Risk in Financial Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
We consider default by firms that are part of a single clearing mechanism. The obligations of all firms within the system are determined simultaneously in a fashion consistent with the priority of debt claims and the limited liability of equity. We first show, via a fixed-point argument, that there always exists a “clearing payment vector” that clears the obligations of the members of the clearing system; under mild regularity conditions, this clearing vector is unique. Next, we develop an algorithm that both clears the financial system in a computationally efficient fashion and provides information on the systemic risk faced by the individual system firms. Finally, we produce qualitative comparative statics for financial systems. These comparative statics imply that, in contrast to single-firm results, even unsystematic, nondissipative shocks to the system will lower the total value of the system and may lower the value of the equity of some of the individual system firms.

## 4. Design for the Environment: A Quality-Based Model for Green Product Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
Green product development, which addresses environmental issues through product design and innovation as opposed to the traditional end-of-pipe-control approach, is receiving significant attention from customers, industries, and governments around the world. In this paper we develop a quality-based model for analyzing the strategic and policy issues concerning the development of products with conflicting traditional and environmental attributes. On the demand side of the problem, we use the framework of conjoint analysis to structure the preferences of the ordinary and green customers. On the supply side, we apply the theories in optimal product design and market segmentation to analyze the producer's strategic decisions regarding the number of products introduced and their prices and qualities. On the policy side, we evaluate the effects of environmental standards on the economic and environmental consequences of green product development. By jointly considering the interactions among the customers' preferences, the producer's product strategies, and the environmental standards imposed by governments, we present some interesting findings that can be used to manage and regulate the development of green products. Two major findings show that green product development and stricter environmental standards might not necessarily benefit the environment.

## 5. Scheduling and Reliable Lead-Time Quotation for Orders with Availability Intervals and Lead-Time Sensitive Revenues
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
Motivated by applications in the manufacturing and service industries, we consider two models for coordinating scheduling with lead-time quotation: a basic model with a single customer type, and an enhanced model where an additional second customer type expects immediate service or production. In both models, revenues obtained from the customers are sensitive to the lead time, there is a threshold of lead time above which the customer does not place an order, and the quoted lead times are 100% reliable. These models are related to well-known scheduling problems, which have been studied in both offline and online settings.

## 6. Efficient Timing of Communication in Multiperiod Agencies
### Author(s):
- Peter O. Christensen
- Gerald A. Feltham
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
This paper examines communication in a two-period principal/agent model in which the agent receives a private signal about the second outcome before the first outcome is realized. No communication is compared with communication at three possible dates: before the first outcome (early), at the first outcome/consumption date (normal), and between the initial consumption date and the second outcome (delayed). Delayed communication is shown to have no value if the agent's information is perfect, but can have value if it is imperfect. Early and normal communication can be used to “smooth” compensation across periods and, hence, generally have incremental value over delayed communication if the agent cannot borrow or save. However, the “smoothing” benefits disappear if he can borrow and save. Early and normal communication are equivalent if the agent has domain-additive exponential preferences and the private signal is uninformative about the first outcome. If the private signal is informative about the first outcome, the incremental value of early compared with normal communication attains its maximum for “medium” informativeness. A unifying example is used throughout.

## 7. Generating Scenario Trees for Multistage Decision Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
In models of decision making under uncertainty we often are faced with the problem of representing the uncertainties in a form suitable for quantitative models. If the uncertainties are expressed in terms of multivariate continuous distributions, or a discrete distribution with far too many outcomes, we normally face two possibilities: either creating a decision model with internal sampling, or trying to find a simple discrete approximation of the given distribution that serves as input to the model. This paper presents a method based on nonlinear programming that can be used to generate a limited number of discrete outcomes that satisfy specified statistical properties. Users are free to specify any statistical properties they find relevant, and the method can handle inconsistencies in the specifications. The basic idea is to minimize some measure of distance between the statistical properties of the generated outcomes and the specified properties. We illustrate the method by single- and multiple-period problems. The results are encouraging in that a limited number of generated outcomes indeed have statistical properties that are close to or equal to the specifications. We discuss how to verify that the relevant statistical properties are captured in these specifications, and argue that what are the relevant properties, will be problem dependent.

## 8. Sequential Testing in Product Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
A fundamental problem in managing product development is the optimal timing, frequency, and fidelity of sequential testing activities that are carried out to evaluate novel product concepts and designs. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that treats testing as an activity that generates information about technical and customer-need related problems. An analysis of the model results in several important findings. First, optimal testing strategies need to balance the tension between several variables, including the increasing cost of redesign, the cost of a test as function of fidelity, and the correlation between sequential tests. Second, a simple form of our model results in an EOQ-like result: The optimal number of tests (called the Economic Testing Frequency or ETF) is the square root of the ratio of avoidable cost and the cost of a test. Third, the relationship between sequential tests can have an impact on optimal testing strategies. If sequential tests are increasing refinements of one another, managers should invest their budgets in a few high-fidelity tests, whereas if the tests identify problems independently of one another it may be more effective if developers carry out a higher number of lower-fidelity tests. Using examples, the implications for managerial practice are discussed and suggestions for further research undertakings are provided.

## 9. Modeling a Phone Center: Analysis of a Multichannel, Multiresource Processor Shared Loss System
### Author(s):
- O. Zeynep Akşin
- Patrick T. Harker
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2001
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model for the study of operations at an inbound call center. The call center is modeled as a multiclass processor shared loss system, where the interacting effects of human, telecommunication, and information technology resources are explicitly incorporated. Product form solutions and approximations for this type of system are provided along with expressions for performance measures like blocking and reneging. Some structural properties of system throughput are analyzed in an effort to pave the way for future optimization studies dealing with the design and management of phone centers.
