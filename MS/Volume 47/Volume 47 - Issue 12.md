### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
This note integrates the models of Dewan and Mendelson (1998) (DM) and Kyle (1985), extending the DM analysis of time-based competition in financial markets to the case of endogenous liquidity. The results enable us to examine the link between information technology investments, trading strategies, and liquidity.

## 2. Product Variety, Supply Chain Structure, and Firm Performance: Analysis of the U.S. Bicycle Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Using data from the U.S. bicycle industry, we examine the relation among product variety, supply chain structure, and firm performance. Variety imposes two types of costs on a supply chain: production costs and market mediation costs. Production costs include, among other costs, the incremental fixed investments associated with providing additional product variants. Market mediation costs arise because of uncertainty in product demand created by variety. In the presence of demand uncertainty, precisely matching supply with demand is difficult. Market mediation costs include the variety-related inventory holding costs, product mark-down costs occurring when supply exceeds demand, and the costs of lost sales occurring when demand exceeds supply. We analyze product variety at the product attribute level, noting that the relative impact of variety on production and market mediation costs depends to a large extent on the attribute underlying the variety. That is, some types of variety incur high production costs and some types of variety incur high market mediation costs. We characterize supply chain structure by the degree to which production facilities are scale-efficient and by the distance of the production facility from the target market. We hypothesize that firms with scale-efficient production (i.e., high-volume firms) will offer types of variety associated with high production costs, and firms with local production will offer types of variety associated with high market mediation costs. This hypothesis implies that there is a coherent way to match product variety with supply chain structure. Empirical results suggest that firms which match supply chain structure to the type of product variety they offer outperform firms which fail to match such choices.

## 3. Performance of Coupled Product Development Activities with a Deadline
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
This paper explores the performance of coupled development activities by proposing a performance generation model (PGM). The goal of the PGM is to develop insights about optimal strategies (i.e., sequential, concurrent, or overlapped) to manage coupled design activities that share a fixed amount of engineering resources subject to performance and deadline constraints. Model analysis characterizes the solution space for the coupled development problem. The solution space is used to explore the generation of product performance and the associated dynamic forces affecting concurrent development practices. We use these forces to explain conditions under which concurrency is a desirable strategy.

## 4. Strategic Factor Market Intelligence: An Application of Information Economics to Strategy Formulation and Competitor Intelligence
### Author(s):
- Richard Makadok
- Jay B. Barney
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model of information-acquisition decisions by firms that are competing in a “strategic factor market” (Barney 1986) to purchase a scarce resource whose value is unknown and differs across firms. The model builds on the argument that more accurate expectations about the firm-specific value of resources is, other than luck, the only way for firms to obtain the specific resources required for competitive advantage. We address the more specific question of what types of information firms should gather to accomplish this goal. The model generates a series of testable hypotheses about how a firm's optimal mix of different types of information is affected by a number of factors, including the level of uncertainty about the value of the resource being acquired; the rarity, imitability, and nonsubstitutability of that resource; the level of inscrutability of firms' pre-existing stocks of resources; and firms' information-gathering and information-processing capacities.

## 5. The Effects of Worker Learning, Forgetting, and Heterogeneity on Assembly Line Productivity
### Author(s):
- Scott M. Shafer

- Mustafa V. Uzumeri
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
The authors investigate through several simulations how patterns of learning and forgetting affect the operating performance of an assembly line. A unique aspect of this study is that a distribution of learning/forgetting behavior based on an empirical population of workers is used rather than assuming the same learning pattern for all employees. The paper demonstrates that modeling only central tendency and not the variations across workers tends to systematically underestimate overall productivity. The data used to estimate the parameters for the distribution of learning curves were collected from an assembly line that produces car radios.

## 6. Project Contracts and Payment Schedules: The Client's Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
Contractual agreements have assumed significant complexity in recent times because of the emergence of strategies like outsourcing and partnering in the successful completion of large software development, manufacturing, and construction projects. A client and contractor enter into an agreement for a project either by bidding or negotiation. Effective and efficient bidding, negotiation, and subsequent monitoring are hindered by the lack of appropriate decision support tools for the management of project finances. Progress payments to the contractor are an important issue in project management because of their potential impact on project finances and activity schedules. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously determining the amount, location, and timing of progress payments in projects from a client's perspective. We develop three mixed-integer linear programming models, based on some practical methods of determining payment schedules from different types of project contracts. We discuss properties of the models and draw insights about the characteristics of optimal payment schedules obtained with each model by an experimental study on a sample of 10 small projects. Our analysis shows that, contrary to current practice, the client obtains the greatest benefit by scheduling the project for early completion such that the payments are not made at regular intervals. It is also cost effective for the client to make payments either in the early stages of the project or toward the end, even though this causes considerable variation in the time gap between payments. We also evaluate the impact of the client's preferred payment schedules on the contractor's finances and activity schedules, and draw some conclusions on the interdependence of payment and project parameters on the objectives of both parties entering the contractual agreement.

## 7. A Two-Location Inventory Model with Transshipment and Local Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
In situations where a seller has surplus stock and another seller is stocked out, it may be desirable to transfer surplus stock from the former to the latter. We examine how the possibility of such transshipments between two independent locations affects the optimal inventory orders at each location. If each location aims to maximize its own profits—we call this local decision making—their inventory choices will not, in general, maximize joint profits. We find transshipment prices which induce the locations to choose inventory levels consistent with joint-profit maximization.

## 8. An Optimization Framework for Product Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
An important problem in the product design and development process is to use the part-worths preferences of potential customers to design a new product such that market share is maximized. The authors present a new optimization framework for this problem, the nested partitions (NP) method. This method is globally convergent and may utilize existing heuristic methods to speed its convergence. We incorporate several known heuristics into this framework and demonstrate through numerical experiments that using the NP method results in superior product designs. Our numerical results suggest that the new framework is particularly useful for designing complex products with many attributes.

## 9. Pricing Claims Under GARCH-Level Dependent Interest Rate Processes
### Author(s):
- V. Cvsa
- P. Ritchken
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
This article considers the pricing of interest-rate-sensitive claims when the underlying interest rate is driven by a two-state-variable GARCH process. Analytical solutions are established for the case when the innovations in the short rate are normal and/or chi-squared random variables and the volatility of rates take on a special GARCH form. GARCH models that nest level-dependent interest rate models, including the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, are also considered. Algorithms are provided that permit the efficient pricing of American-style interest rate claims under a rather broad array of GARCH-Level dependent processes.

## 10. What Determines the Shape of the Probability Weighting Function Under Uncertainty?
### Author(s):
- Michael Kilka
- Martin Weber
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2001
### Abstract:
Decision weights are an important component in recent theories of decision making under uncertainty. To better explain these decision weights, a two-stage approach has been proposed: First, the probability of an event is judged and then this probability is transformed by the probability weighting function known from decision making under risk. We extend the two-stage approach by allowing the probability weighting function to depend on the type of uncertainty. Using this more general approach, properties of decision weights can be attributed to properties of probability judgments and/or to properties of probability weighting. We present an empirical study that shows that it is indeed necessary to allow the probability weighting function to be source dependent. The analysis includes an examination of properties of the probability weighting function under uncertainty that have not been considered yet.
