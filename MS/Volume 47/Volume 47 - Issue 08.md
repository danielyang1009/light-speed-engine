### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new model for studying the new product development process in an artificial environment. We show how connectionist models can be used to simulate the adaptive nature of agents' learning exhibiting similar behavior as practically experienced learning curves. We study the impact of incentive schemes (local, hybrid, and global) on the new product development process for different types of organizations. Sequential organizational structures are compared to two different types of team-based organizations, incorporating methods of quality function deployment such as the house of quality. A key finding of this analysis is that the firms' organizational structure and agents' incentive system significantly interact. We show that the house of quality is less affected by the incentive scheme than firms using a trial and error approach. This becomes an important factor for new product success when the agents' performance measures are conflicting.

## 2. Contingent Labor Contracting Under Demand and Supply Uncertainty

### Abstract:
Firms increasingly use contingent labor to flexibly respond to demand in many environments. Labor supply agencies are growing to fill this need. As a result, firms and agencies are engaging in long-term contracts for labor supply. We develop mathematical models of the interaction between firms and labor supply agencies when demand and supply are uncertain. We consider two models of labor supply uncertainty, termed productivity and availability uncertainty, and study how each affects the nature of the contracts formed. These models reflect two major roles played by the labor supply agency. In the case of productivity uncertainty we find that it is possible to construct a contract that coordinates the firm and agency hiring in an optimal way. In contrast, we show that in environments characterized by availability uncertainty, optimal contracts are not possible. However, there is a large range of contract parameters for which both parties would benefit from a contract. We analyze these and discuss the trade-offs that should be considered in contract negotiation.

## 3. Exchange Rates and the Choice of Ownership Structure of Production Facilities

### Abstract:
The aim of this research is to study the effects of real exchange rates on the long-term ownership strategies of production facilities of firms entering foreign markets. Among the strategies considered are exporting (EXP), joint ventures with local partners (JV), and wholly owned production facilities (WOS) in the foreign country. Our research takes a first step in modeling the influence of exchange rates on the choice and dynamic adjustment of such strategies. The insights obtained from our modeling analysis are then translated into testable hypotheses and empirically verified with the use of firm level data from U.S. multinational corporations (both at the firm and a more aggregate level). An insightful result of our model is the identification of a hysteresis phenomenon that characterizes switching behavior between strategies in the presence of switchover cost. The magnitude of the hysteresis band, which is a measure of the inertia associated with keeping the current ownership structure, is affected by a multiplicity of factors such as exchange rate volatility and market power of the entering firm. Analytical and numerical results on the effects of such factors on the hysteresis band are provided. The four testable hypotheses generated from our modeling analysis are rigorously tested with the use of a multinomial logit model on data obtained from the Harvard Multinational Enterprise database, and a data set maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Department of Commerce. The empirical results strongly support our insights that relatively depreciated real exchange rates (i.e., weak home currency) favor (a) the JV over the WOS and (b) EXP mode over the WOS or JV. Finally, we summarize our results into useful guidelines for global production managers.

## 4. Capacity Acquisition, Subcontracting, and Lot Sizing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
The fundamental question encountered in acquiring capacity to meet nonstationary demand over a multiperiod horizon is how to balance the trade-off between having insufficient capacity in some periods and excess capacity in others. In the former situation, part of the demand is subcontracted while, in the latter, capacity that has been paid for is rendered idle. Capacity and subcontracting decisions arise in many economic activities ranging from production capacity planning in semiconductor fabs to leasing communication networks, from transportation contracts to staffing of call centers. In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between acquiring capacity, subcontracting, production, and holding inventory to satisfy nonstationary demand over a finite horizon. We present capacity acquisition models with holding and without holding inventory and identify forecast-robust properties of the models that restrict the dependence of optimal capacity decisions on the demand forecasts. We develop algorithms for numerous practical cost structures involving variable and fixed charges and prove that they all have polynomial time complexity. For models with inventory, we solve a sequence of constant capacity lot-sizing and subcontracting subproblems, which is also of independent interest.

## 5. An Adaptive, Distribution-Free Algorithm for the Newsvendor Problem with Censored Demands, with Applications to Inventory and Distribution
### Author(s):
- Gregory A. Godfrey
- Warren B. Powell
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of optimizing inventories for problems where the demand distribution is unknown, and where it does not necessarily follow a standard form such as the normal. We address problems where the process of deciding the inventory, and then realizing the demand, occurs repeatedly. The only information we use is the amount of inventory left over. Rather than attempting to estimate the demand distribution, we directly estimate the value function using a technique called the Concave, Adaptive Value Estimation (CAVE) algorithm. CAVE constructs a sequence of concave piecewise linear approximations using sample gradients of the recourse function at different points in the domain. Since it is a sampling-based method, CAVE does not require knowledge of the underlying sample distribution. The result is a nonlinear approximation that is more responsive than traditional linear stochastic quasi-gradient methods and more flexible than analytical techniques that require distribution information. In addition, we demonstrate near-optimal behavior of the CAVE approximation in experiments involving two different types of stochastic programs—the newsvendor stochastic inventory problem and two-stage distribution problems.

## 6. On Maximizing the Net Present Value of a Project Under Renewable Resource Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the resource-constrained project-scheduling problem with discounted cash flows. Each activity of this resource-constrained project-scheduling problem has certain resource requirements and a known deterministic cash flow that can be either positive or negative. Deterministic cash flows are assumed to occur over the duration of the activities. Progress payments and cash outflows occur at the completion of activities. The objective is to schedule the activities subject to a fixed deadline to maximize the net present value subject to the precedence and resource constraints. With these features the financial aspects of project management are taken into account.We introduce a depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm that makes use of extra precedence relations to resolve a number of resource conflicts and a fast recursive search algorithm for the max-npv problem to compute upper bounds. The recursive search algorithm exploits the idea that positive cash flows should be scheduled as early as possible while negative cash flows should be scheduled as late as possible within the precedence constraints. The procedure has been coded in Visual C++, Version 4.0 under Windows NT, and has been validated on two problem sets.

## 7. Asymptotic Distribution of the EMS Option Price Estimator
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
Monte Carlo simulation is commonly used for computing prices of derivative securities when an analytical solution does not exist. Recently, a new simulation technique known as empirical martingale simulation (EMS) has been proposed by Duan and Simonato (1998) as a way of improving simulation accuracy. EMS has one drawback however. Because of the dependency among sample paths created by the EMS adjustment, the standard error of the price estimate is not readily available from using one simulation sample. In this paper, we develop a scheme to estimate the EMS accuracy. The EMS price estimator is first shown to have an asymptotically normal distribution. Through a simulation study, we then find that the asymptotic normal distribution serves as a good approximation for samples consisting of as few as 500 simulation paths.

## 8. New Procedures to Select the Best Simulated System Using Common Random Numbers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
Although simulation is widely used to select the best of several alternative system designs, and common random numbers is an important tool for reducing the computation effort of simulation experiments, there are surprisingly few tools available to help a simulation practitioner select the best system when common random numbers are employed. This paper presents new two-stage procedures that use common random numbers to help identify the best simulated system. The procedures allow for screening and attempt to allocate additional replications to improve the value of information obtained during the second stage, rather than determining the number of replications required to provide a given probability of correct selection guarantee. The procedures allow decision makers to reduce either the expected opportunity cost associated with potentially selecting an inferior system, or the probability of incorrect selection. A small empirical study indicates that the new procedures outperform several procedures with respect to several criteria, and identifies potential areas for further improvement.

## 9. Regression, Correlation, and the Time Interval: Additive-Multiplicative Framework
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
When two random variables are both additive or multiplicative, the effect of the way one “slices” the available period to subperiods (time intervals) is well documented in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the time interval effect when one of the variables is additive and one is multiplicative. We prove that the squared multiperiod correlation coefficient (ρ2n) decreases monotonically as n increases, and approaches zero when n goes to infinity. However, for relevant data corresponding to the U.S. stock market index, when shifting from weekly parameters to quarterly parameters the decrease in ρ2n is negligible. The effect on the regression coefficient is much more dramatic and even a shift from weekly data to quarterly data affects the regression coefficient substantially. The regression slope generally approaches zero, minus infinity or plus infinity, as the number of periods increases. Montonicity, however, exists only in certain cases.

## 10. Hybridising Tabu Search with Optimisation Techniques for Irregular Stock Cutting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2001
### Abstract:
Sequential meta-heuristic implementations for the irregular stock-cutting problem have highlighted a number of common problems. The literature suggests a consensus that it is more efficient to allow configurations with overlapping pieces in the solution space and to penalise these in the evaluation function. However, depending on the severity of the penalty this relaxation results in a tendency to converge toward infeasible solutions or to seek out feasible solutions at the expense of overall quality. A further problem is encountered in defining a neighbourhood search strategy that can deal with the infinite solution space inherent in the irregular stock-cutting problem. The implementation in this paper adopts a hybrid tabu search approach that incorporates two very different optimisation routines that utilise alternative neighbourhoods to address the described problems.
