## 1. Leveraging the Customer Base: Creating Competitive Advantage Through Knowledge Management
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Professional services firms (e.g., consultants, accounting firms, or advertising agencies) generate and sell business solutions to their customers. In doing so, they can leverage the cumulative experience gained from serving their customer base to either reduce their variable costs or increase the quality of their products/services. In other words, their “production technology” exhibits some form of increasing returns to scale. Growth and globalization, coupled with recent advances in information technology, have led many of these firms to introduce sophisticated knowledge management (KM) systems in order to create sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, the authors analyze how KM is likely to affect competition among such professional services firms. In particular, they first explore what type (supply-side versus demand-side) of economies of scale are likely to be exploited in KM systems. In the former case, KM's role is to reduce the operating costs of the firm, while in the latter case, its role is to create added value to customers by significantly increasing product quality. Second, the authors analyze the competitive dynamics and market structure that emerge as a result of firms competing with KM systems. The results shed light on the current literature exploring the deployment of KM systems by suggesting that in a competitive setting, when firms' ability to leverage their customer base is high, KM should lead to quality improvement rather than cost reductions. In a dynamic setting, it is also shown that when firms use their KM system to improve product quality, higher ability to leverage the customer base may actually hurt profits and lead to industry shakeout. Beyond normative insights, the results also support a number of recent market trends in management consulting, including the increased emphasis on knowledge-creating activities in modern KM systems, the wave of mergers between consulting firms, and the recent emergence of “retail consulting” services.

## 2. Bayesian Models for Early Warning of Bank Failures

### Abstract:
The focus of this research is to demonstrate how probabilistic models may be used to provide early warnings for bank failures. While prior research in the auditing literature has recognized the applicability of a Bayesian belief revision framework for many audit tasks, empirical evidence has suggested that auditors' cognitive decision processes often violate probability axioms. We believe that some of the well-documented cognitive limitations of a human auditor can be compensated by an automated system. In particular, we demonstrate that a formal belief revision scheme can be incorporated into an automated system to provide reliable probability estimates for early warning of bank failures. The automated system examines financial ratios as predictors of a bank's performance and assesses the posterior probability of a banks financial health (alternatively, financial distress). We examine two different probabilistic models, one that is simpler and makes more assumptions, while the other that is somewhat more complex but makes fewer assumptions. We find that both models are able to make accurate predictions with the help of historical data to estimate the required probabilities. In particular, the more complex model is found to be very well calibrated in its probability estimates. We posit that such a model can serve as a useful decision aid to an auditor's judgment process.

## 3. On Continuous-Time Optimal Advertising Under S-Shaped Response
### Author(s):
- Fred M. Feinberg
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
Continuous-time monopolistic models of advertising expenditure that rely on strict response concavity have been shown to prescribe eventual spending at a constant rate. However, analyses of discrete analogs have suggested that S-shaped response (convexity for low expenditure levels) may allow for the periodic optima encountered in actual practice. Casting the dynamic between advertising and sales in a common format (an autonomous, first-order relationship), the present paper explores extensions along three dimensions: an S-shaped response function, the value of the discount rate, and the possibility of diffusion-like response. Supplementing the treatment by Mahajan and Muller (1986), a flexible class of S-shaped response models is formulated for which it is demonstrated that, in contrast to findings in the literature on discretized advertising models, continuous periodic optima cannot be supported. Further, a set of conditions on the advertising response function are derived, that contains and extends that suggested by Sasieni (1971). Collectively, these results both suggest a set of baseline properties that reasonable models should possess and cast doubt on the ability of first-order models to capture effects of known managerial relevance.

## 4. Note: The Newsvendor Model with Endogenous Demand
### Author(s):
- James D. Dana, Jr.
- Nicholas C. Petruzzi
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
This paper considers a firm's price and inventory policy when it faces uncertain demand that depends on both price and inventory level. The authors extend the classic newsvendor model by assuming that expected utility maximizing consumers choose between visiting the firm and consuming an exogenous outside option. The outside option represents the utility the consumer forgoes when she chooses to visit the firm before knowing whether or not the product will be available. The authors investigate both the case in which the firm's price is exogenous and the case in which price is chosen optimally. The paper makes two contributions. First, the authors show that the firm holds more inventories, provides a higher fill rate, attracts more customers, and earns higher profits when it internalizes the effect of its inventory on demand. Second, the authors show that in the endogenous price case the firm's two-dimensional decision problem can be reduced to two, sequential, single-variable optimizations. As a result, the endogenous-price case is as easy to solve as the exogenous-price case.

## 5. Making Descriptive Use of Prospect Theory to Improve the Prescriptive Use of Expected Utility
### Author(s):
- Han Bleichrodt

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a quantitative modification of standard utility elicitation procedures, such as the probability and certainty equivalence methods, to correct for commonly observed violations of expected utility. Traditionally, decision analysis assumes expected utility not only for the prescriptive purpose of calculating optimal decisions but also for the descriptive purpose of eliciting utilities. However, descriptive violations of expected utility bias utility elicitations. That such biases are effective became clear when systematic discrepancies were found between different utility elicitation methods that, under expected utility, should have yielded identical utilities. As it is not clear how to correct for these biases without further knowledge of their size or nature, most utility elicitations still calculate utilities by means of the expected utility formula. This paper speculates on the biases and their sizes by using the quantitative assessments of probability transformation and loss aversion suggested by prospect theory. It presents quantitative corrections for the probability and certainty equivalence methods. If interactive sessions to correct for biases are not possible, then the authors propose to use the corrected utilities rather than the uncorrected ones in prescriptions of optimal decisions. In an experiment, the discrepancies between the probability and certainty equivalence methods are removed by the authors' proposal.

## 6. A Theory of Finitely Durable Goods Monopoly with Used-Goods Market and Transaction Costs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
We construct a dynamic game to model a monopoly of finitely durable goods. The solution concept is Markov-perfect equilibria with general equilibria embedded in every time period. Our model is flexible enough to simultaneously explain or accommodate many commonly observed phenomena or stylized facts, such as concurrent leasing and selling, active secondary markets for used goods, heterogeneous consumers, endogenous consumption patterns, depreciation, an infinite time horizon, and nontrivial transaction costs. Within our model, consumers have incentives to segment themselves into various consumption classes according to their willingness to pay, and nontrivial transaction costs to sell used goods put strong constraints on consumers' consumption sequences in time. As a direct consequence of the finite durability, the market power of the monopolist remains intact. Leasing manifests itself as a facilitator of price discrimination by debundling the durable good into new and used portions that are naturally bundled together under outright sales. The concurrent leasing and selling reflects the degree of the comparative advantage the monopolist has over consumers in disposing used goods. This comparative advantage, which is partially exploited by the monopolist and partially shared by the consumers, provides a sufficient mechanism to gain Pareto improvement on the market.

## 7. Validation of Trace-Driven Simulation Models: Bootstrap Tests
### Author(s):
- Jack P. C. Kleijnen

- Bert Bettonvil
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
Trace-driven (or correlated inspection) simulation means that the simulated and the real systems have some common inputs (say, historical arrival times) so that the two systems' outputs are cross-correlated. To validate such a simulation, this paper focuses on the difference between the average simulated and real responses. To evaluate this validation statistic, the paper develops a novel bootstrap technique—based on replicated runs. This validation statistic and the bootstrap technique are evaluated in extensive Monte Carlo experiments with specific single-server queues. These experiments show acceptable Type-I and Type-II error probabilities.

## 8. Optimal Operating Policies for Multiplant Stochastic Manufacturing Systems in a Changing Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the horizontal coordination between production units located in different countries within a supply chain in a changing environment. The model incorporates (1) congestion and delay through uncertainties in demand and processing times, (2) a changing production cost environment through uncertainty in an environmental state (such as the exchange rate), and (3) allowing production to stock. The main contribution of the paper is to characterize the optimal production policy, assuming no switchover cost, as a barrier-type control policy for a series of models. For each plant, there is a barrier function defined on the environmental state that gives the total worldwide stock level barrier: This plant should be operated if and only if the stock level is below this barrier. The authors also show that, in a simple setting of two plants in different countries, the barrier functions are not always monotone in the exchange rate even when the production costs are. The authors present a condition under which the control barriers are shown to be monotone. Under this condition and with only two plants, it is optimal to follow a primary/secondary plant policy in which, given a fixed environmental state, it is optimal to operate both plants when stock is low, only the primary plant when stock is moderate, and neither when stock is high. Furthermore, the roles of the plants switch as the environmental state passes through the equal production cost state. In addition, the firm seeks to carry the most stock as a hedge against future environmental state moves, when one plant is significantly cheaper than the other. The firm seeks to carry the least stock when both plants are equally costly to operate.

## 9. Pricing for a Durable-Goods Monopolist Under Rapid Sequential Innovation
### Author(s):
- Laura J. Kornish
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
A durable-goods monopolist who will be introducing new and improved versions of his product must decide how to price his products, keeping in mind the relative attractiveness of the current and future products. Dhebar (1994) has shown that if technology is changing too quickly and the producer cannot credibly commit to future prices and quality, then no equilibrium strategy exists. That is, there is no credible strategy for the future product that the producer can commit to in the first period. We show that an equilibrium pricing strategy exists if the monopolist does not offer upgrade pricing, that is, special pricing to consumers who have bought an earlier version. The author shows the possible purchase patterns in equilibrium and derives the optimal pricing strategy.

## 10. A Coordinated Production Planning Model with Capacity Expansion and Inventory Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2001
### Abstract:
Motivated by a problem faced by a large manufacturer of a consumer product, we explore the interaction between production planning and capacity acquisition decisions in environments with demand growth. We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights—increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase in set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity. We also provide solutions and insights to the real problem that motivated this work.
