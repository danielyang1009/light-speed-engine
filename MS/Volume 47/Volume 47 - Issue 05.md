### Abstract:
The evolution of technology has been a central issue in the strategy and organizations literature. However, the focus of much of this work has been on what is essentially the “supply side” of technical change—the evolution of firm capabilities. We present a demand-based view of technology evolution that is focused on the interaction between technology development and the demand environment in which the technology is ultimately evaluated. We develop a formal computer simulation model that explicitly considers the influence of heterogeneity in market demand—the presence of consumers with different needs and requirements—on firms' innovation choices. The model is used to examine the dynamics of product and process innovation (Utterback and Abernathy 1975). The analysis reveals that demand heterogeneity offers an alternative to supply-side explanations of the technology life cycle. Further, by considering the implications of decreasing marginal utility from performance improvements, the model highlights the role of “technologically satisfied” consumers in shaping innovation incentives, and suggests a rationale for a new stage in the technology life cycle characterized by increasing performance at a stable price. The stage has not yet been treated formally in the literature, but is widely observed, most prominently in digital and information-based technologies.

## 2. Contracting to Assure Supply: How to Share Demand Forecasts in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Forecast sharing is studied in a supply chain with a manufacturer that faces stochastic demand for a single product and a supplier that is the sole source for a critical component. The following sequence of events occurs: the manufacturer provides her initial forecast to the supplier along with a contract, the supplier constructs capacity (if he accepts the contract), the manufacturer receives an updated forecast and submits a final order. Two contract compliance regimes are considered. If the supplier accepts the contract under forced compliance then he has little flexibility with respect to his capacity choice; under voluntary compliance, however, he maintains substantial flexibility. Optimal supply chain performance requires the manufacturer to share her initial forecast truthfully, but she has an incentive to inflate her forecast to induce the supplier to build more capacity. The supplier is aware of this bias, and so may not trust the manufacturer's forecast, harming supply chain performance. We study contracts that allow the supply chain to share demand forecasts credibly under either compliance regime.

## 3. Managerial Allocation of Time and Effort: The Effects of Interruptions

### Abstract:
Time is one of the more salient constraints on managerial behavior. This constraint may be very taxing in high-velocity environments where managers have to attend to many tasks simultaneously. Earlier work by Radner (1976) proposed models based on notions of the thermostat or “putting out fires” to guide managerial time and effort allocation among tasks. We link these ideas to the issue of the level of complexity of the tasks to be attended to while alluding to the sequential versus parallel modes of processing. We develop a stochastic model to analyze the behavior of a manager who has to attend to a few short-term processes while attempting to devote as much time as possible to the pursuit of a long-term project. A major aspect of this problem is how the manager deals with interruptions. Different rules of attention allocation are proposed, and their implications to managerial behavior are discussed.

## 4. Parallel and Sequential Testing of Design Alternatives
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2001
### Abstract:
An important managerial problem in product design in the extent to which testing activities are carried out in parallel or in series. Parallel testing has the advantage of proceeding more rapidly than serial testing but does not take advantage of the potential for learning between tests, thus resulting in a larger number of tests. We model this trade-off in the form of a dynamic program and derive the optimal testing strategy (or mix of parallel and serial testing) that minimizes both the total cost and time of testing. We derive the optimal testing strategy as a function of testing cost, prior knowledge, and testing lead time. Using information theory to measure the test efficiency, we further show that in the case of imperfect testing (due to noise or simulated test conditions), the attractiveness of parallel strategies decreases. Finally, we analyze the relationship between testing strategies and the structure of design hierarchy. We show that a key benefit of modular product architecture lies in the reduction of testing cost.

## 5. Ending Inventory Valuation in Multiperiod Production Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2001
### Abstract:
When making lot-sizing decisions, managers often use a model horizon T that is much smaller than any reasonable estimate of the firm's future horizon. This is done because forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly for longer horizons, while computational burden increases. However, what is optimal over the short horizon may be suboptimal over the long run, resulting in errors known as end-effects. A common end-effect in lot-sizing models is to set end-of-horizon inventory to zero. This policy can result in excessive setup costs or stock-outs in the long run.

## 6. Coordination Mechanisms for a Distribution System with One Supplier and Multiple Retailers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2001
### Abstract:
We address a fundamental two-echelon distribution system in which the sales volumes of the retailers are endogenously determined on the basis of known demand functions. Specifically, this paper studies a distribution channel where a supplier distributes a single product to retailers, who in turn sell the product to consumers. The demand in each retail market arrives continuously at a constant rate that is a general decreasing function of the retail price in the market. We have characterized an optimal strategy, maximizing total systemwide profits in a centralized system. We have also shown that the same optimum level of channelwide profits can be achieved in a decentralized system, but only if coordination is achieved via periodically charged, fixed fees, and a nontraditional discount pricing scheme under which the discount given to a retailer is the sum of three discount components based on the retailer's (i) annual sales volume, (ii) order quantity, and (iii) order frequency, respectively. Moreover, we show that no (traditional) discount scheme, based on order quantities only, suffices to optimize channelwide profits when there are multiple nonidentical retailers. The paper also considers a scenario where the channel members fail to coordinate their decisions and provides numerical examples that illustrate the value of coordination. We extend our results to settings in which the retailers' holding cost rates depend on the wholesale price.

## 7. Producer-Supplier Contracts with Incomplete Information
### Author(s):
- Wei Shi Lim
### Published:
- 1 May 2001
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the contract design problem of a producer when he purchases parts from a supplier, and there is incomplete information regarding the quality of the parts. This is the first game-theoretic model of quality control that captures this informational asymmetry. We focus on two compensation schemes embedded in the contract, namely, price rebate (when inspection is done upon receipt of the parts) and warranty. We show that when a full-price rebate is not possible and the producer and the supplier have to share the damage costs, an optimal contract is such that the supplier compensates the producer by the same amount, regardless of his quality type. However, a supplier with low quality is more likely to be offered a contract with an inspection scheme, while a supplier with high quality is constrained with a warranty scheme. We also show that when the producer need not share the cost in exactly one of the compensation schemes, he may still offer the other compensation scheme to a supplier type depending on the relative costs involved, the maximum compensation cost acceptable by all supplier types, and his ex ante beliefs about the quality level of the supplier.

## 8. Prospect Theory, Mental Accounting, and Differences in Aggregated and Segregated Evaluation of Lottery Portfolios
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
If individuals have to evaluate a sequence of lotteries, their judgment is influenced by the presentation mode. Experimental studies have found significantly higher acceptance rates for a sequence of lotteries if the overall distribution was displayed instead of the set of lotteries itself. Mental accounting and loss aversion provide an easy and intuitive explanation for this phenomenon. In this paper we offer an explanation that incorporates further evaluation concepts of Prospect Theory. Our formal analysis of the difference in aggregated and segregated portfolio evaluation demonstrates that the higher attractiveness of the aggregated presentation mode is not a general phenomenon (as suggested in the literature) but depends on specific parameters of the lotteries. The theoretical findings are supported by an experimental study. In contrast to the existing evidence and in line with our theoretical results, we find for specific types of lotteries an even lower acceptance rate if the overall distribution is displayed.
