### Abstract:
Can a firm accelerate its learning curve if knowledge about the production function is incomplete? This article identifies a production line specifically set up to create technological knowledge about its production function through scientific experimentation (formal learning) as opposed to learning by doing. The organizational structure of this line was very successful in creating technological knowledge. Formal learning resulted in huge productivity improvements. Replication of this organizational structure on three production lines in other plants within the same firm fell short of expectations. Formal learning did not result in similar productivity improvements. Our research suggests two factors that may facilitate creation and transfer of technological knowledge: management buy-in and knowledge diversity to solve interdepartmental problems.

## 2. The Effect of Collaborative Forecasting on Supply Chain Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We consider a cooperative, two-stage supply chain consisting of two members: a retailer and a supplier. In our first model, called local forecasting, each member updates the forecasts of future demands periodically, and is able to integrate the adjusted forecasts into his replenishment process. Forecast adjustments made at both levels of the supply chain can be correlated. The supply chain has a decentralized information structure, so that day-to-day inventory and forecast information are known locally only. In our second model, named collaborative forecasting, the supply chain members jointly maintain and update a single forecasting process in the system. Hence, forecasting information becomes centralized. Finally, we consider as a benchmark the special case in which forecasts are not integrated into the replenishment processes at all. We propose a unified framework that allows us to study and compare the three types of settings. This study comes at a time when various types of collaborative forecasting partnerships are being experimented within industry, and when the drivers for success or failure of such initiatives are not yet fully understood. In addition to providing some managerial insights into questions that arise in this context, our set of models is tailored to serve as building blocks for future work in this emerging area of research.

## 3. Integrating Replenishment Decisions with Advance Demand Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
There is a growing consensus that a portfolio of customers with different demand lead times can lead to higher, more regular revenues and better capacity utilization. Customers with positive demand lead times place orders in advance of their needs, resulting in advance demand information. This gives rise to the problem of finding effective inventory control policies under advance demand information. We show that state-dependent (s, S) and base-stock policies are optimal for stochastic inventory systems with and without fixed costs. The state of the system reflects our knowledge of advance demand information. We also determine conditions under which advance demand information has no operational value. A numerical study allows us to obtain additional insights and to evaluate strategies to induce advance demand information.

## 4. Job Rotation as a Learning Mechanism
### Author(s):
- Jaime Ortega
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
This article analyzes the costs and benefits of job rotation as a mechanism with which the firm can learn about the employees' productivities and the profitability of different jobs or activities. I compare job rotation to an assignment policy where employees specialize in one job along their career. The gains from adopting a job rotation policy are larger when there is more prior uncertainty about employees and activities. I argue that this firm learning theory fits the existing evidence on rotation better than alternative explanations based on employee motivation and employee learning.

## 5. Stocking Decisions for Low-Usage Items in a Multilocation Inventory System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
This research shows that organizations with a number of “sister” plants, warehouses, or other stocking points can profit from the concept of proactive use of transshipments as an element of their inventory control policy. For certain types of parts, employing transshipments can significantly reduce the total inventory needed throughout the entire collection of stocking points. The study is motivated by a real-life situation involving a large utility company having 29 power-generating plants in five Southeastern states where there are thousands of parts that are commonly used at multiple plants.

## 6. A Dynamic Lot-Sizing Model with Demand Time Windows
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
One of the basic assumptions of the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is that the aggregate demand of a given period must be satisfied in that period. Under this assumption, if backlogging is not allowed, then the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier or later than the period. If backlogging is allowed, the demand of a given period cannot be delivered earlier than the period, but it can be delivered later at the expense of a backordering cost. Like most mathematical models, the classical dynamic lot-sizing model is a simplified paraphrase of what might actually happen in real life. In most real-life applications, the customer offers a grace period—we call it a demand time window—during which a particular demand can be satisfied with no penalty. That is, in association with each demand, the customer specifies an acceptable earliest and a latest delivery time. The time interval characterized by the earliest and latest delivery dates of a demand represents the corresponding time window.

## 7. Improving Discrete Model Representations via Symmetry Considerations
### Author(s):
- Hanif D. Sherali
- J. Cole Smith
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
In this paper, we focus on a useful modeling concept that is frequently ignored while formu lating discrete optimization problems. Very often, there exists a natural symmetry inherent in the problem itself that, if propagated to the model, can hopelessly mire a branch-and-bound solver by burdening it to explore and eliminate such alternative symmetric solutions. We discuss three applications where such a symmetry arises: a telecommunications network design problem, a noise pollution problem, and a machine procurement and operation problem. For each case, we identify the indistinguishable objects in the model that create the problem symmetry and show how imposing certain decision hierarchies within the model significantly enhances its solvability, while using a popular modern-day commercial branch-and-cut software (CPLEX 6.5).

## 8. The Latest Arrival Hub Location Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
The traditionally studied hub location problems in the literature pay attention to flight times but not to transient times spent at hubs for unloading, loading, and sorting operations. The transient times may constitute a significant portion of the total delivery time for cargo delivery systems. We focus on the minimization of the arrival time of the last arrived item in cargo delivery systems and develop a model that correctly computes the arrival times by taking into account both the flight times and the transient times. Nonlinear and linear integer formulations are given and computational results are provided. The effects of delays on the system performance are analyzed.

## 9. Server Assignment Policies for Maximizing the Steady-State Throughput of Finite Queueing Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2001
### Abstract:
For a system of finite queues, we study how servers should be assigned dynamically to stations in order to obtain optimal (or near-optimal) long-run average throughput. We assume that travel times between different service facilities are negligible, that each server can work on only one job at a time, and that several servers can work together on one job. We show that when the service rates depend only on either the server or the station (and not both), then all nonidling server assignment policies are optimal. Moreover, for a Markovian system with two stations in tandem and two servers, we show that the optimal policy assigns one server to each station unless that station is blocked or starved (in which case the server helps at the other station), and we specify the criterion used for assigning servers to stations. Finally, we propose a simple server assignment policy for tandem systems in which the number of stations equals the number of servers, and we present numerical results that show that our policy appears to yield near-optimal throughput under general conditions.
