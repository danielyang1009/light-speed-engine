## 1. The Trade-off Between Efficiency and Learning in Interorganizational Relationships for Product Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the performance implications of interorganizational relationships in the development of technological innovations, focusing on the characteristics of the tasks partitioned between a manufacturer and its suppliers in the development of new products. We identify two critical dimensions: (1) the design scope and (2) the level of task interdependency. The design scope dimension characterizes the type of problem-solving activities outsourced by the manufacturer. The level of task interdependency dimension characterizes the influence of any given supplier-manufacturer interaction on other activities within an overall innovation process. Data analyses on 50 supplier-manufacturer relationships drawn from three new product development projects show that the type of problem-solving activities being partitioned and their level of interdependency with the rest of the project are important predictors of performance outcomes of the relationship, controlling for contractual differences. Further, the analyses demonstrate a clear trade-off between short-term efficiency-increasing and longer-term learning-enhancing outcomes.

## 2. Capacitated Multi-Item Inventory Systems with Random and Seasonally Fluctuating Demands: Implications for Postponement Strategies
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We address multi-item inventory systems with random and seasonally fluctuating, and possibly correlated, demands. The items are produced in two stages, each with its own lead-time; in the first stage a common intermediate product is manufactured. The production volumes in the first stage are bounded by given capacity limits. We develop an accurate lower bound and close-to-optimal heuristic strategies of simple structure. The gap between them, evaluated in an extensive numerical study, is on average only 0.45%. We use the model to investigate the benefits of various delayed product differentiation (postponement) strategies, as well as other strategic questions, including (i) the benefits of flexible versus dedicated production facilities; (ii) the trade-off between capacity and inventory investments; and (iii) the trade-off between capacity investments and service levels.

- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
Firms use samples to increase the sales of almost all consumable goods, including food, health, and cleaning products. Despite its importance, sampling remains one of the most under-researched areas. There are no theoretical quantitative models of sampling behavior other than the pioneering work of Jain et al. (1995), who modeled sampling as an important factor in the diffusion of new products.

## 4. Fast Simulation of Markov Chains with Small Transition Probabilities

### Abstract:
Consider a finite-state Markov chain where the transition probabilities differ by orders of magnitude. This Markov chain has an “attractor state,” i.e., from any state of the Markov chain there exists a sample path of significant probability to the attractor state. There also exists a “rare set,” which is accessible from the attractor state only by sample paths of very small probability. The problem is to estimate the probability that starting from the attractor state, the Markov chain hits the rare set before returning to the attractor state. Examples of this setting arise in the case of reliability models with highly reliable components as well as in the case of queueing networks with low traffic. Importance-sampling is a commonly used simulation technique for the fast estimation of rare-event probabilities. It involves simulating the Markov chain under a new probability measure that emphasizes the most likely paths to the rare set. Previous research focused on developing importance-sampling schemes for a special case of Markov chains that did not include “high-probability cycles.” We show through examples that the Markov chains used to model many commonly encountered systems do have high-probability cycles, and existing importance-sampling schemes can lead to infinite variance in simulating such systems. We then develop the insight that in the presence of high-probability cycles care should be taken in allocating the new transition probabilities so that the variance accumulated over these cycles does not increase without bounds. Based on this observation we develop two importance-sampling techniques that have the bounded relative error property, i.e., the simulation run-length required to estimate the rare-event probability to a fixed degree of accuracy remains bounded as the event of interest becomes more rare.

## 5. An Empirical Examination of Dynamic Quality-Based Learning Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
Using detailed data on defect rates and quality costs from twelve plants of a Fortune 500 company, we provide the first direct tests of predictions arising from two sets of dynamic quality-based learning models. We find greater support for quality-based learning models that assume learning is a function of both proactive investments in quality improvement and autonomous learning-by-doing, than for models that assume learning is a function of reactive investments in quality improvement alone. We then extend these two sets of models to examine the impact of individual prevention activities and past nonconformance expenditures on defect rates. We find that benefits from different types of prevention expenditures vary, and that past nonconformance expenditures provide learning opportunities that allow the organization to more efficiently cope with future failures, thereby reducing subsequent nonconformance costs. These important implications are absent in current quality-based learning models, providing an opportunity for future theoretical development.

## 6. Sharing and Lateral Transshipment of Inventory in a Supply Chain with Expensive Low-Demand Items
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
The emergence of carriers that deliver items to geographically dispersed destinations quickly and at a reasonable cost, combined with the low cost of sharing information through networked databases, has opened up new opportunities to better manage inventory. We investigate these benefits in the context of a supply chain in which a manufacturer supplies expensive, low-demand items to vertically integrated or autonomous retailers via one central depot. The manufacturer's lead time is assumed to be due to the geographical distance from the market or a combination of low volumes, high variety, and inflexible production processes. We formulate and solve an appropriate mathematical model based on one-for-one inventory policies in which a replenishment order is placed as soon as the customer withdraws an item. We find that sharing and transshipment of items often, but not always, reduces the overall costs of holding, shipping, and waiting for inventory. Unexpectedly, these cost reductions are sometimes achieved through increasing overall inventory levels in the supply chain. Finally, while sharing of inventory typically benefits all the participants in decentralized supply chains, this is not necessarily the case—sharing can hurt the distributor or individual retailers, regardless of their relative power in the supply chain.

## 7. A Generalized Model of Operations Reversal for Fashion Goods
### Author(s):
- Nikhil Jain
- Anand Paul
### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
Operations reversal is a process design principle that involves switching two consecutive stages of the manufacturing process to improve process performance. In this paper we investigate conditions under which operations reversal can be used to reduce the variability—as measured by the variance and standard deviation—of production volumes at the intermediate stage of the manufacturing process. We generalize the operations reversal model of Lee and Tang (1998) to explicitly incorporate two important characteristics of fashion goods markets: heterogeneity among customers and unpredictability of customer preferences. We also present a new approach to modeling the operations reversal problem.

## 8. Strong One-Switch Utility
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
The linear plus exponential utility function has received increasing attention of late as a particularly attractive family for evaluating additive gambles for wealth. In addition to its ability to reflect increasing appreciation for money, risk aversion, and decreasing risk aversion, it is consistent with a risk-return representation in which return is measured by expected value. In this paper we present a new condition, strong one-switch, that characterizes the linear plus exponential family.

## 9. Information Sharing in a Supply Chain: A Note on its Value when Demand Is Nonstationary
### Author(s):
- Srinivasan Raghunathan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 2001
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Lee, So, and Tang (2000) showed that in a two-level supply chain with non-stationary AR(1) end demand, the manufacturer benefits significantly when the retailer shares point-of-sale (POS) demand data. We show in this paper, analytically and through simulation, that the manufacturer's benefit is insignificant when the parameters of the AR(1) process are known to both parties, as in Lee, So, and Tang (LST). The key reason for the difference between our results and those of LST is that LST assume that the manufacturer also uses an AR(1) process to forecast the retailer order quantity. However, the manufacturer can reduce the variance of its forecast further by using the entire order history to which it has access. Thus, when intelligent use of already available internal information (order history) suffices, there is no need to invest in interorganizational systems for information sharing.
