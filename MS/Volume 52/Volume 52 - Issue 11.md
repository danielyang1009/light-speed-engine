### Abstract:
In kidney allocation, transplant candidates may have private information about their propensity to enjoy good outcomes after transplantation or about their relative expected improvement in quality of life after transplantation. This paper develops a mechanism design model to investigate the effect of such information asymmetry on the kidney allocation system. In this model, there are n transplant queues corresponding to n candidate types. Candidate types are only observed by the candidates, and each candidate chooses the queue to join by reporting a type. Kidneys have heterogeneous types, and each kidney will be assigned to one of the queues depending on its type. Candidates report their type strategically to join the queue that maximizes their utility. Candidate utility depends on the type of kidney received and the expected waiting time, which is calculated using fluid approximations. We consider two alternative social welfare functions: aggregate utility (emphasizing efficiency) and minimum utility across all candidates (emphasizing equity). The kidney allocation problem is to divide the organ supply among the different queues so that social welfare is maximized, and this problem is solved explicitly under both objective functions. There are three findings: (1) The allocation mechanism induces truth telling by ensuring that candidates who wait longer receive better kidneys; (2) Information rents are earned by high-risk candidates under the efficiency objective and by low-risk candidates under the equity objective; (3) a choice-based kidney allocation system in which candidates choose the type of queue to join leads to outcomes in the middle of the efficiency-equity spectrum.

## 4. Exploratory Innovation, Exploitative Innovation, and Performance: Effects of Organizational Antecedents and Environmental Moderators

### Published:

### Abstract:
Research on exploration and exploitation is burgeoning, yet our understanding of the antecedents and consequences of both activities remains rather unclear. We advance the growing body of literature by focusing on the apparent differences of exploration and exploitation and examining implications for using formal (i.e., centralization and formalization) and informal (i.e., connectedness) coordination mechanisms. This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e., dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit’s financial performance in more competitive environments. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment, we contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding of how ambidextrous organizations coordinate the development of exploratory and exploitative innovation in organizational units and successfully respond to multiple environmental conditions.

### Abstract:
Motivated by several examples from industry, such as the introduction of a biotechnology-based process innovation in nylon manufacturing, we consider a technology provider that develops and introduces innovations to a market of industrial customers—original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The technology employed by these OEMs determines the performance quality of the end product they manufacture, which in turn forms the basis of competition among them. Within this context of downstream competition, we examine the technology provider’s introduction strategies when improving technologies are introduced sequentially.

## 6. Organizational Design and the Intensity of Rivalry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
We analyze the effect of managerial compensation schemes and organizational structure on competitive behavior in imperfectly competitive product markets. Previous research suggests that in cases of strategic substitutability, firms tend to choose organizational structures and compensation systems that commit the firm to behaving aggressively in the product market, reducing firm and industry profits. In contrast, we show that while compensation and structure in isolation lead to excessive aggressiveness, the combination of these two internal choice variables may reverse the outcome—organizational design can be used as a commitment device to reduce competitive rivalry. Finally, we find that in equilibrium, firms may choose to be different; one firm is decentralized and uses incentives that commit it to being aggressive, while the other is centralized and uses incentives that commit it to being soft. Hence, endogenous firm heterogeneity in the form of organizational differentiation allows firms to avoid a mutually detrimental outcome.

## 7. Network Software Security and User Incentives

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
We study the effect of user incentives on software security in a network of individual users under costly patching and negative network security externalities. For proprietary software or freeware, we compare four alternative policies to manage network security: (i) consumer self-patching (where no external incentives are provided for patching or purchasing); (ii) mandatory patching; (iii) patching rebate; and (iv) usage tax. We show that for proprietary software, when the software security risk and the patching costs are high, for both a welfare-maximizing social planner and a profit-maximizing vendor, a patching rebate dominates the other policies. However, when the patching cost or the security risk is low, self-patching is best. We also show that when a rebate is effective, the profit-maximizing rebate is decreasing in the security risk and increasing in patching costs. The welfare-maximizing rebates are also increasing in patching costs, but can be increasing in the effective security risk when patching costs are high. For freeware, a usage tax is the most effective policy except when both patching costs, and security risk are low, in which case a patching rebate prevails. Optimal patching rebates and taxes tend to increase with increased security risk and patching costs, but can decrease in the security risk for high-risk levels. Our results suggest that both the value generated from software and vendor profits can be significantly improved by mechanisms that target user incentives to maintain software security.

## 8. Design of Robust Business-to-Business Electronic Marketplaces with Guaranteed Privacy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
Firms that set up electronic marketplaces to enhance their supply and/or distribution channels face challenges in attracting their competitors to participate. A major obstacle is the perception that the owner can unfairly exploit trading information for competitive advantage. In this paper, we propose a marketplace design that shifts the locus of control over trader privacy from the marketplace operator to each individual trader. We show how online transactions between trading partners can be conducted in total privacy, so that not even the marketplace owner/operator can exploit transaction information for strategic purposes. At the same time, our approach includes robust methods for transaction integrity and nonrepudiation, as well as posttransaction dispute resolution.

## 9. A Typology of Plants in Global Manufacturing Networks

### Published:

### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to propose a new, empirically derived typology of plants in the international manufacturing network of multinational companies. This typology is based on the knowledge flows between the plants. In our research, network analysis has been used as a methodology for understanding the position of plants in international manufacturing networks. The focus has been primarily on the intangible knowledge network, and secondarily on the physical, logistic network. Our analysis leads to four types of plants with different network roles: the isolated plants, the receivers, the hosting network players, and the active network players. Our analysis shows that the different types of plants play a different strategic role in the company, have a different focus, and differ in age, autonomy, and level of resources and investments. Also, the analysis suggests that the evolution of the plant depends to some extent on the network role of the plant. Finally, two scenarios for the development of a strong network role are identified. The research is useful for the scholar studying the architecture of knowledge networks, as well as for the practitioner who is in charge of an international network of manufacturing units.

## 10. Measuring and Mitigating the Costs of Stockouts

- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
There is now an extensive theoretical literature investigating optimal inventory policies for retailers. Yet several recent reviews have recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand. In this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both other items in the current order as well as future orders.

## 11. A Fractiles Perspective to the Joint Price/Quantity Newsvendor Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
Pricing and quantity decisions are critical to many firms across different industries. We study the joint price/quantity newsvendor model where only a single quantity and price decision is made, such as a fashion or holiday product that cannot be replenished and where the price is advertised nationally and cannot be changed. Demand is uncertain and sensitive to price. We develop a method for easily finding the optimal price and quantity that applies to more general cases than the usual one in which uncertainty is either additive, multiplicative, or a combination of the two. We represent a quantity by its fractile of the probability distribution of demand for a given price. We use a standard approach to approximating a given distribution with a finite number of representative fractiles and assume that these fractile functions are piecewise linear functions of the price. We identify effects that are not usually seen in a joint price/quantity newsvendor model. For example, although the optimal quantity is a decreasing function of the unit cost, the optimal price can be nonmonotone in the unit cost and we shed insight into why. We illustrate that using a simplified structure of demand uncertainty can result in substantially lower profits.

## 12. Dynamic Control of an M/M/1 Service System with Adjustable Arrival and Service Rates
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
We study a service facility in which the system manager dynamically controls the arrival and service rates to maximize the long-run average value generated. We initially consider a rate-setting problem where the service facility is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with adjustable arrival and service rates and solve this problem explicitly. Next, we use this solution to study a price-setting problem, where customers are utility maximizing and price- and delay-sensitive, and the system manager chooses state-dependent service rates and prices. We find that the optimal arrival rate is decreasing and the optimal service rate is increasing in the number of customers in the system; however, the optimal price need not be monotone. We also show that under the optimal policy, the service facility operates as one with a finite buffer. Finally, we study a numerical example to compare the social welfare achieved using a dynamic policy to that achieved using static policies and show the dynamic policy offers significant welfare gains.

## 13. Some Empirical Regularities in Market Shares
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We present some empirical regularities in the market shares of brands. Our cross-sectional data on market shares consists of 1,171 brands in 91 product categories of foods and sporting goods sold in the United States. One of our results is that the pattern of market shares for each of the categories (many of which are fundamentally dissimilar, such as breakfast cereals and rifles) is represented well by the power law. The power law also does better than an alternative model—namely, the exponential form—which has previously been studied in the literature but without having been compared to any alternative. These two models have sharply different implications; for example, the power law predicts that the ratio of market shares for two successively ranked brands becomes smaller as one progresses from higher-ranked to lower-ranked brands, whereas the exponential form predicts that this ratio is a constant. Our findings have several managerial and research implications, which we summarize.

## 14. Note on Self-Restraint as an Online Entry-Deterrence Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2006
### Abstract:
We develop a game-theoretical model to show that in the markets where price consistency across channels is critical, an incumbent brick-and-mortar retailer can deter the online entry of a pure-play e-tailer by strategically refraining from entering online. In the markets where price consistency is not a constraint, we find that the incumbent can deter the e-tailer’s entry only if it enters online and credibly operates the online channel as an independent profit center. In other words, the incumbent must be willing to cannibalize its own brick-and-mortar business by charging a low online price. We also discuss some social welfare implications of retail online entry and the managerial insights of our analysis.
