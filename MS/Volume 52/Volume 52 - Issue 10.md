## 3. Location Choices Across the Value Chain: How Activity and Capability Influence Collocation
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
There has been a recent revival of interest in the geographic component of firm strategy. Recent research suggests that two opposing forces—competition costs and agglomeration benefits—determine whether firms collocate in a given geographic market. Unexplored is (1) whether these forces have different impacts on R&D, production, and sales subsidiaries, leading to diverse collocation levels, and (2) how firm capabilities impact collocation by increasing or decreasing competition costs and agglomeration benefits. I explore these questions using the worldwide location decisions of firms in the cellular handset industry. I find that production and sales subsidiaries are more geographically dispersed, and R&D subsidiaries are more concentrated, than a random distribution would predict. When distinguishing firms by their capabilities, I find that more-capable firms collocate less than less-capable firms, regardless of the activity performed.

## 4. Vendor Certification and Appraisal: Implications for Supplier Quality

- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
We examine the buyer's problem of inducing the supplier's quality effort using two arrangements: the appraisal regime and the certification regime. In the appraisal regime, the buyer inspects the units supplied and either charges a penalty for defective units identified during inspection or pays the unit price for good units. In the certification regime, the supplier obtains vendor certification and the buyer pays the unit price for all units supplied. The inspection technology and the certification process provide noisy information on the supplier's quality effort. In the appraisal regime, the buyer implements the supplier's high-quality and low-inspection. The supplier's expected profit is greater than his reservation profit because of an additional agency cost: The buyer has to prevent the supplier from performing unwanted/preemptive inspection (which gives rise to indirect costs from delay, etc.). This additional agency cost arises precisely when the effectiveness of inspection is high. This provides a moral-hazard-based rationale for the increasing use of certification (such as ISO 9000) in spite of (in fact, because of) the increasing effectiveness of inspection. The potential for additional agency cost incurred by the buyer in the appraisal regime highlights an indirect cost associated with inspection.

## 5. Coordinating Supply Chains with Simple Pricing Schemes: The Role of Vendor-Managed Inventories
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
We characterize supply chain settings in which perfect coordination can be achieved with simple wholesale pricing schemes: either retailer-specific constant unit wholesale prices or retailer-specific volume discount schemes. We confine ourselves to two-echelon supply chains with a single supplier servicing a network of retailers who compete with each other by selecting sales quantities. We identify a key sufficient condition, in terms of interdependencies between chain members' operational decisions, under which perfect coordination via simple schemes is feasible, under general cost and demand functions. This condition, which we refer to as echelon operational autonomy (EOA), states that the costs incurred by the supplier for a given vector of sales volumes depends only on operational decisions she controls herself. At the same time, the costs incurred by the retailers may depend on operational decisions controlled by the supplier, in which case, the supplier's operational decisions are made to minimize chainwide costs. We show how vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships create EOA and compare the resulting coordinating pricing schemes with those required in a traditional decentralized setting (without EOA). We also discuss compliance issues with the coordinating schemes in view of the Robinson-Patman act and provide remedies to overcome these issues.

## 6. Transshipment of Inventories Among Retailers: Myopic vs. Farsighted Stability
### Author(s):
- Greys Sošić
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
The author considers a model of a decentralized distribution system consisting of n retailers selling an identical product. Retailers face a stochastic demand and must order their initial inventory before this demand is realized. After demand realization, retailers decide how much of their unsold inventory or unsatisfied demand they want to share with other retailers. This is followed by a transshipment of leftover inventories and distribution of the additional profit generated through inventory sharing.

## 7. Partnership in a Dynamic Production System with Unobservable Actions and Noncontractible Output
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
This paper considers two firms that engage in joint production. The prospect of repeated interaction introduces dynamics, in that actions that firms take today influence the costliness and effectiveness of actions in the future. Repeated interaction also facilitates the use of informal agreements (relational contracts) that are sustained not by the court system, but by the ongoing value of the relationship. We characterize the optimal relational contract in this dynamic system with double moral hazard. We show that an optimal relational contract has a simple form that does not depend on the past history. The optimal relational contract may require that the firms terminate their relationship with positive probability following poor performance. We show how process visibility, which allows the firms to better assess who is at fault, can substantially improve system performance. The degree to which process visibility eliminates the need for termination depends on the nature of the dynamics: If the buyer's action does not influence the dynamics, the need for termination is eliminated; otherwise, termination may be required.

## 8. Assortment Planning and Inventory Decisions Under a Locational Choice Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
We consider a single-period assortment planning and inventory management problem for a retailer, using a locational choice model to represent consumer demand. We first determine the optimal variety, product location, and inventory decisions under static substitution, and show that the optimal assortment consists of products equally spaced out such that there is no substitution among them regardless of the distribution of consumer preferences. The optimal solution can be such that some customers prefer not to buy any product in the assortment, and such that the most popular product is not offered. We then obtain bounds on profit when customers dynamically substitute, using the static substitution for the lower bound, and a retailer-controlled substitution for the upper bound. We thus define two heuristics to solve the problem under dynamic substitution and numerically evaluate their performance. This analysis shows the value of modeling dynamic substitution and identifies conditions in which the static substitution solution serves as a good approximation.

## 9. Characterization of the Bullwhip Effect in Linear, Time-Invariant Supply Chains: Some Formulae and Tests
### Author(s):
- Yanfeng Ouyang
- Carlos Daganzo
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
The authors analyze the bullwhip effect in multistage, decentralized supply chains operated with linear and time-invariant inventory management policies; the focus is on robustness. The supply chain is modeled as a single-input, single-output control system driven by arbitrary customer demands. The authors derive robust analytical conditions to predict the presence of the bullwhip effect and bound its magnitude, based only on the way inventories are managed. These results hold independently of the customer demand. The authors also characterize the stream of orders placed at any stage of the chain when the customer demand process is known and ergodic and give an exact formula for the variance of the orders placed. This formula generalizes existing results by broadening the class of inventory replenishment policies and customer demand processes to which it applies. The authors also show that the bullwhip effect can be mitigated by introducing commitments for future orders into the ordering policies.

## 10. The Process of Innovation Assimilation by Firms in Different Countries: A Technology Diffusion Perspective on E-Business
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
This paper extends our previous studies on the assimilation of Internet-based e-business innovations by firms in an international setting. Drawing upon theories on the process and contexts of technology diffusion, we develop an integrative model to examine three assimilation stages: initiation → adoption → routinization. The model features technological, organizational, and environmental contexts as prominent antecedents of this three-stage assimilation process. Based on this model, we hypothesize how technology readiness, technology integration, firm size, global scope, managerial obstacles, competition intensity, and regulatory environment influence e-business assimilation at the firm level. A unique data set of 1,857 firms from 10 countries is used to test the conceptual model and hypotheses. To probe deeper into the influence of the environmental context, we compare two subsamples from developed and developing countries. Our empirical analysis leads to several key findings: (1) Competition positively affects initiation and adoption, but negatively impacts routinization, suggesting that too much competition is not necessarily good for technology assimilation because it drives firms to chase the latest technologies without learning how to use existing ones effectively. (2) Large firms tend to enjoy resource advantages at the initiation stage, but have to overcome structural inertia in later stages. (3) We also find that economic environments shape innovation assimilation: Regulatory environment plays a more important role in developing countries than in developed countries. Moreover, while technology readiness is the strongest factor facilitating assimilation in developing countries, technology integration turns out to be the strongest in developed countries, implying that as e-business evolves, the key determinant of its assimilation shifts from accumulation to integration of technologies. Together, these findings offer insights into how innovation assimilation is influenced by contextual factors, and how the effects may vary across different stages and in different environments.

## 11. Strategic Manipulation of Internet Opinion Forums: Implications for Consumers and Firms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
There is growing evidence that consumers are influenced by Internet-based opinion forums before making a variety of purchase decisions. Firms whose products are being discussed in such forums are therefore tempted to manipulate consumer perceptions by posting costly anonymous messages that praise their products. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm’s manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of that firm’s true quality, strategic manipulation of online forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a firm’s true quality exist in settings where the firm’s net payoff function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular (submodular) in the firm’s quality and manipulation action. Third, in a broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a “rat race” and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if they don’t, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing “filtering” technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate. Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from the development of such technologies.

## 12. Measuring Cross-Category Price Effects with Aggregate Store Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
Our objective is to understand the cross-category effects of marketing activities using aggregate store-level scanner data. For this, we provide a framework derived from household utility maximizing behavior which assumes that a household chooses the “bundle” of products with the highest utility. We use a second-order Taylor series approximation to an arbitrary utility function to represent bundle utility. Aggregate sales or shares in each category are derived under the assumption that households are heterogeneous in their preferences and in their sensitivities to marketing activities. Our estimation accounts for potential price endogeneity in demand. Using store-level scanner data on four product categories—liquid laundry detergents, powdered laundry detergents, liquid fabric softeners, and sheet fabric softeners—we find evidence for a complementary relationship between liquid softeners and both forms of detergents. We also find that the magnitude of cross-category elasticities are brand specific, i.e., different brands in a category have a different price impact on the demand for a brand in another category. The results have implications for retailers in terms of the potential need for cross-category management, as well as for manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble that participate in all four categories. We compare our model with a log-log regression specification on three criteria—estimated elasticities, hold-out sample predictions, and retailer cross-category pricing. We find that the proposed model produces more reasonable estimates relative to the log-log model; it predicts better and is more useful for pricing purposes. Further, in a simulation study, we show that our proposed model can recover the elasticities from a data-generating process that simulates household-level joint outcomes across categories even after these data have been aggregated to brand-level shares within each category. By contrast, the log-log regression model is unable to do so.

## 13. A Data Disclosure Policy for Count Data Based on the COM-Poisson Distribution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
Count data arise in various organizational settings. When the release of such data is sensitive, organizations need information-disclosure policies that protect data confidentiality while still providing data access. In contrast to extant disclosure policies, we describe a new policy for count tables that is based on disclosing only the sufficient statistics of a flexible discrete distribution. This distribution, the COM-Poisson, well approximates Poisson counts but also under- and over-dispersed counts. The sufficient statistics mask the exact cell counts and often also the table size. Under the scenario of a data holding agency and a data snooper, we show that this policy has low disclosure risk with no loss of data utility: Usually, many count tables correspond to the disclosed sufficient statistics. Furthermore, these count tables are equally likely to be the undisclosed table. Finding these solutions requires solving a system of linear equations, which are underdetermined for tables with more than three cells, and can be computationally prohibitive for even small tables. We also consider cell-specific interval bounds, a commonly used disclosure limitation policy, and compare them to our policy. We describe several types of snooper knowledge, their integration with the disclosed statistics, and implications. Applying this policy to three real data sets, we illustrate the low associated disclosure risk.

## 14. A Theory of Banks' Industry Expertise, Market Power, and Credit Risk
### Author(s):
- Alex Stomper
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
The author analyzes banks' incentives to acquire expertise in judging the creditworthiness of borrowers in an industry with uncertain business conditions. The analysis shows that industry expertise enables banks to extract rents proportional to their exposure to industry-specific credit risk. This exposure is in turn determined by the number of banks aiming to focus on lending to an industry. In equilibrium, the industry receives funding from a limited number of banks with industry expertise, as well as from a competitive fringe of financiers without such expertise. The equilibrium yields testable predictions about the concentration of bank lending to an industry, and about the correlation between this concentration and the recovery rates, default rates, and interest rates of bank loans.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2006
### Abstract:
The task allocation problem (TAP) is one where a number of tasks or modules need to be assigned to a set of processors or machines at minimum overall cost. The overall cost includes the communication cost between tasks that are assigned to different processors and other costs such as the assignment cost and the fixed cost of using processors. Processors may have limited or unlimited capacities to perform tasks. Task allocation has been applied to the design of distributed computing systems and also in auto-manufacturing contexts. We present several integer programs and a column generation formulation for the uncapacitated and the capacitated TAP. Computational experiments are carried out to demonstrate computational capabilities of integer programming and the column generation formulations for the uncapacitated TAP (UTAP). Excellent results are obtained for the column generation formulation. We also report some computational experience for the capacitated TAP (CTAP).
