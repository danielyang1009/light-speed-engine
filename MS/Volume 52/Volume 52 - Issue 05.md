## 2. On the Value of Mitigation and Contingency Strategies for Managing Supply Chain Disruption Risks
### Author(s):
- Brian Tomlin
### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
We study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier’s percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse.

## 3. Data Shuffling—A New Masking Approach for Numerical Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
This study discusses a new procedure for masking confidential numerical data—a procedure called data shuffling—in which the values of the confidential variables are “shuffled” among observations. The shuffled data provides a high level of data utility and minimizes the risk of disclosure. From a practical perspective, data shuffling overcomes reservations about using perturbed or modified confidential data because it retains all the desirable properties of perturbation methods and performs better than other masking techniques in both data utility and disclosure risk. In addition, data shuffling can be implemented using only rank-order data, and thus provides a nonparametric method for masking. We illustrate the applicability of data shuffling for small and large data sets.

## 4. The Contingent Effects of Transactive Memory: When Is It More Beneficial to Know What Others Know?

### Abstract:
Previous studies have provided evidence of the positive impact of transactive memory (TM) on group performance, such as the efficient storage and recall of knowledge and better product quality. This paper aims to unify the experimental research on TM and to extend it to more dynamic and diverse group settings. In this paper, we develop an empirically grounded computational model—ORGMEM—and apply it to explore the contingent effects of TM on group performance. The comparison between virtual experimental results and relevant laboratory experimental results demonstrates the validity of ORGMEM as a useful tool to study memory-related phenomena. Through a series of virtual experiments, we find that TM decreases group response time by facilitating knowledge retrieval processes and improves decision quality by informing task coordination and evaluation. Our results also suggest that the effects of TM are contingent upon group characteristics, such as group size and environment, as well as the dimension along which group performance is assessed. Overall, TM seems to be more beneficial to small groups using quality as the dependent variable, but more beneficial to large groups, groups in a dynamic task environment, and groups in a volatile knowledge environment using time as the dependent variable.

## 5. Dynamic Catalog Mailing Policies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
Deciding who should receive a mail-order catalog is among the most important decisions that mail-order-catalog firms must address. In practice, the current approach to the problem is invariably myopic: firms send catalogs to customers who they think are most likely to order from that catalog. In doing so, the firms overlook the long-run implications of these decisions. For example, it may be profitable to mail to customers who are unlikely to order immediately if sending the current catalog increases the probability of a future order. We propose a model that allows firms to optimize mailing decisions by addressing the dynamic implications of their decisions. The model is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. We apply the model to a large sample of historical data provided by a catalog firm and then evaluate its performance in a large-scale field test. The findings offer support for the proposed model but also identify opportunities for further improvement.

## 6. Selectively Acquiring Customer Information: A New Data Acquisition Problem and an Active Learning-Based Solution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new information acquisition problem motivated by business applications where customer data has to be acquired with a specific modeling objective in mind. In the last two decades, there has been substantial work in two different fields—optimal experimental design and machine learning—that has addressed the issue of acquiring data in a selective manner with a specific objective in mind. We show that the problem presented here is different from the classic model-based data acquisition problems considered thus far in the literature in both fields. Building on work in optimal experimental design and in machine learning, we develop a new active learning technique for the information acquisition problem presented in this paper. We demonstrate that the proposed method performs well based on results from applying this method across 20 Web usage and machine learning data sets.

## 7. Targeted Advertising Strategies on Television

### Abstract:
The personal video recorder (PVR) facilitates the use of targeted advertising by allowing companies to monitor television viewing behavior and to build demographic profiles of viewers from the data that are collected. Our research explores the extent to which an advertiser should allocate resources to increase the quality of its targeting. We present a game-theoretic model that extends the conventional measurement of targeting quality by exploring the trade-off between two measures: accuracy and recognition. Accuracy measures the likelihood that any target segment prediction is correct, while recognition conversely measures the likelihood that any member of the target segment is identified. We find that the relative resources allocated to improving accuracy and recognition depend upon the size of the population of viewers, the propensity of viewers to skip commercials, the overall cost of airing commercials, and the competitive environment. Furthermore, the incentives to improve accuracy are markedly different from those to improve recognition. Although improving accuracy does not affect the extent of price competition, improving recognition leads to intensified price competition and reduced profitability in the product market. Thus, when facing a competitor that pursues a strategy to improve its recognition of potential customers, an advertiser should choose to reduce its investment in recognition and increase its investment in accuracy.

## 8. Up Close and Personal: Investor Sophistication and the Disposition Effect
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the trading records of a major discount brokerage house to investigate the disposition effect, the tendency to sell stocks that have appreciated in price (winners) sooner than stocks that trade below the purchase price (losers). In contrast to previous research that has demonstrated the disposition effect by aggregating across investors, our main objective is to identify differences in the disposition bias across individuals and explain this in terms of underlying investor characteristics. Building on the findings in experimental economics and social psychology, we hypothesize that differences in investor literacy about financial markets and trading frequency are responsible in part for the variation in individual disposition effect. Using demographic and socioeconomic variables as proxies for investor literacy, we find empirical evidence that wealthier individuals and individuals employed in professional occupations exhibit a lower disposition effect. Consistent with experimental economics, trading frequency also tends to reduce the disposition effect. We provide guidelines for investment advisors, regulators, and investment communities to utilize our findings and help investors make better decisions.

## 9. Joint Production and Pricing Decisions with Setup Costs and Capacity Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of setting prices and choosing production quantities for a single product over a finite horizon for a capacity-constrained manufacturer facing price-sensitive demands. There is a fixed cost per production run and a variable cost per unit produced, both of which may vary by period. We characterize properties of the optimal solution, considering cases with constant and time-varying capacity, and with and without speculative motive for holding inventory. We show that, counter to intuition, optimal prices may increase as the capacity increases, even when capacity is constant over the horizon. We also show that increases in capacity do not always exhibit diminishing marginal returns.

## 10. Interdependency, Competition, and the Distribution of Firm and Industry Profits
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
Coordination of interdependencies among firms’ productive activities has been advanced as a promising explanation for sustained heterogeneity in capabilities among firms. In this paper, we extend this line of research to determine the industry structures and patterns of expected firm profits for the case when difficulty optimizing interdependent activities does, in fact, generate and sustain capability heterogeneity among firms. We combine a widely used agent-based model where firms search to discover sets of activities that complement one another (reducing overall costs or raising product quality) with traditional economic models of competition among profit-maximizing firms. The agent-based model produces a distribution of performance (interpreted as variable cost or product quality) among firms and the competition models determine resulting industry outcomes including patterns of entry, exit, and profits. The integration of economic models of competition among firms with an agent-based model of search for improvement by firms reveals a rich relationship between interdependencies in production functions and industry structure, firm profits, and industry average profitability.

## 11. The Effects of New Franchisor Partnering Strategies on Franchise System Size
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
Many young firms use strategic actions to attract partners who help them increase the size of their operations quickly. This article examines the use of strategic actions to attract partners and increase system size in the context of franchising. We build on research in entrepreneurship, marketing, organization theory, strategic management, and finance to develop specific hypotheses about the influences of franchisor pricing policy and strategic control decisions on system size. We test these hypotheses empirically, using panel data on a sample of 1,292 business format franchise systems from 152 industries that were established in the United States between 1979 and 1996 and followed from their inception forward in time. Our model accounts for the endogeneity of strategic decisions, controls for unobserved firm and industry factors, and accounts for selection effects due to system failure. The results show that franchisors that grow larger (1) lower royalty rates as the systems age, (2) have low up-front franchise fees that rise over time, (3) own a small proportion of outlets and lower that percentage over time, (4) keep franchisees’ initial investment low, and (5) finance their franchisees.

## 12. Optimal Mechanisms with Finite Agent Types
### Author(s):
- William S. Lovejoy
### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
In some mechanism design problems, finite-type spaces may be natural ones to consider, yet the current literature is dominated by analyses of continuous-type spaces. This probably derives from the intellectual dominance of the early work in this area. Here we present an analysis of the finite-state case that unifies and generalizes current understanding of these problems. We analyze general quasi-linear utility functions among asymmetric agents with an arbitrary number of finite types, in the context of incentive-compatible direct revelation games. A key part of the analysis is the relationship between expected benefit functions that feature alternative forms of supermodularity that translate into relaxations or restrictions of the original problem. The required features can be attained with a range of assumptions on the model primitives, each of which can support the results. This unified approach can suggest a range of alternative assumption combinations, often more general than their counterparts in the continuous-space literature, and each of which can reduce the problem to a more tractable form. Also, mechanism design problems with finite-type spaces can require conscious attention to how the principal handles ties, which are probability-zero events, and hence innocuous in continuous spaces.

## 13. A Note on Feedback Sequential Equilibria in a Lanchester Model with Empirical Application
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2006
### Abstract:
We study in this paper dynamic equilibrium advertising strategies in a duopoly with asymmetric information structure and sequential play. The advertising model of Lanchester is used in a game where the relevant solution concept is feedback Stackelberg equilibrium, which is subgame perfect. An algorithm is devised for the computation of this equilibrium, and numerical results are reported and discussed. Using a data set from the cola market, we obtain the resulting advertising strategies and provide a comparison with closed-loop and open-loop Nash equilibria.
