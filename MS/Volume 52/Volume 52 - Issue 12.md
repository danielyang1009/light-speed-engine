### Abstract:
This paper examines the link between a suppliers marketing and service operations and its business customers subsequent repatronage behavior. We develop a dynamic model of service contract renewal for an individual firm, at the contract level, recognizing interdependencies among service contract renewal decisions due to the firms purchase of multiple contracts from the same supplier. The decision to renew a service contract is modeled as a function of service quality and price, where service quality is measured by the suppliers service operations metrics over time. By incorporating longitudinal data about the suppliers service operations, this study investigates how average service levels, variability in service levels (especially extreme outcomes), and timing of service delivery influence firms service contract renewal decisions. The study context is support services for high-technology systems in business markets in Germany and the United Kingdom, where service operations metrics over time typically have skewed distributions. Firm behavior is represented by a binary choice model at the contract level, estimated as a binary response model with a complementary log-log link function incorporating random intercepts. The study shows that a firm that has a few extremely favorable experiences for a given service contract is more likely to subsequently renew that service contract, after controlling for average service levels. Firms weigh recent experiences (i.e., within the past year)rather than earlier experienceswhen deciding whether or not to renew, so the timing of service experiences may be critical to the survival of buyer-seller relationships. Overall, the study suggests that models of customer retention should incorporate the extent, variability, and timing of a suppliers service delivery over time at the contract/product level.

## 3. Impact of Licensing on Investment and Financing of Technology Development

### Abstract:
Technology innovations continue to be one of the greatest drivers of economic growth. Realizing the value of such innovations, however, requires substantial follow-on investments in development and commercialization. The value of these investments is difficult to capture because of uncertain demand and potential competition. This often leads to difficulties in obtaining outside financing for these investments. In this paper, we explore how licensing contracts can both dissuade other firms from developing alternative technologies and alleviate the financing problem. We develop a model in which a firm that invests in the development efforts of an innovation can license its technology to a potential competitor. A variety of licensing possibilities is considered, including fixed fees, royalty schedules, and two-part licenses consisting of an up-front payment and a capped royalty schedule. When the firm has no financial constraint, a royalty schedule that depends on realized demand dominates a fixed fee per license. When investment funds are constrained, a royalty cap license with an up-front payment can serve as a source of financing. We also study the investment problem conditional on the licensing and financing decisions.

## 4. Reconsideration of the Winner-Take-All Hypothesis: Complex Networks and Local Bias

### Abstract:
The literature on network effects has popularized a hypothesis that competition between incompatible technologies results in the winner-take-all outcome. For the survival of the firm in this sort of competition, the installed base has been emphasized. We argue that the validity of this hypothesis depends on how customers interact with one another (e.g., if they exchange advice or files). In some interaction networks, customers influenced by their acquaintances may adopt a lagging technology even when a lead technology has built a large installed base. The presence of such a local bias facilitates the persistence of incompatibilities. When local bias cannot be sustained in other interaction networks, one technology corners the market. Our study suggests that overemphasizing the installed base, while ignoring network structure, could mislead practitioners.

### Abstract:
Despite considerable empirical research, results on the relationships among constructs related to information system (IS) success, as well as the determinants of IS success, are often inconsistent. A comprehensive understanding of IS success thus remains elusive. In an attempt to address this situation, which may partly be due to the exclusion of potentially important constructs from prior parsimonious models of IS success, we present and test a comprehensive theoretical model. This model explains interrelationships among four constructs representing the success of a specific IS (user satisfaction, system use, perceived usefulness, and system quality), and the relationships of these IS success constructs with four user-related constructs (user experience with ISs, user training in ISs, user attitude toward ISs, and user participation in the development of the specific IS) and two constructs representing the context (top-management support for ISs and facilitating conditions for ISs). To test the model, we first used meta-analysis to compute a correlation matrix for the constructs in the model based on 612 findings from 121 studies published between 1980 and 2004, and then used this correlation matrix as input for a LISREL analysis of the model. Overall, we found excellent support for the theoretical model. The results underline the importance of user-related and contextual attributes in IS success and raise questions about some commonly believed relationships.

## 6. Common Method Variance in IS Research: A Comparison of Alternative Approaches and a Reanalysis of Past Research

### Abstract:
Despite recurring concerns about common method variance (CMV) in survey research, the information systems (IS) community remains largely uncertain of the extent of such potential biases. To address this uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First, we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227 respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216 correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics, CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely significant but also are not statistically differentiable from uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV, and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as those found in other disciplines.

## 7. Quality-Based Competition, Profitability, and Variable Costs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2006
### Abstract:
We consider the impact of variable production costs on competitive behavior in a duopoly where manufacturers compete on quality and price in a two-stage game. In the pricing stage, we make no assumptions regarding these costsother than that they are positive and increasing in qualityand no assumptions about whether or not the market is covered. In the quality stage, we investigate a broad family of variable cost functions and show how the shape of these functions impacts equilibrium product positions, profits, and market coverage. We find that seemingly slight changes to the cost functions curvature can produce dramatically different equilibrium outcomes, including the degree of quality differentiation, which competitor is more profitable (the one offering higher or lower quality), and the nature of the market itself (covered or uncovered). Our model helps to predict and explain the diversity of outcomes we see in practicesomething the previous literature has been unable to do.

## 8. Production and Inventory Control of a Single Product Assemble-to-Order System with Multiple Customer Classes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2006
### Abstract:
We consider the optimal production and inventory control of an assemble-to-order system with m components, one end-product, and n customer classes. A control policy specifies when to produce each component and, whenever an order is placed, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of an optimal policy. We show that a base-stock production policy is optimal, but the base-stock level for each component is dynamic and depends on the inventory level of all other components (more specifically, it is nondecreasing). We show that the optimal inventory allocation for each component is a rationing policy with different rationing levels for different demand classes. The rationing levels for each component are dynamic and also nondecreasing in the inventory level of all other components. We compare the performance of the optimal policy to heuristic policies, including the commonly used base-stock policy with fixed base-stock levels, and find them to perform surprisingly well, especially for systems with lost sales.

## 9. Strategic Investments, Trading, and Pricing Under Forecast Updating
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2006
### Abstract:
This paper considers two independent firms that invest in resources such as capacity or inventory based on imperfect market forecasts. As time progresses and new information becomes available, the firms update their forecasts and have the option to trade their resources. The trade contract is determined as the bargaining equilibrium or, alternatively, as the price equilibrium. Assuming a fairly general form of the profit functions, we characterize the Nash equilibrium investment levels, which are first-best under the price equilibrium trade contract, but not under the bargaining equilibrium trade contract. To gain additional insights, we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a general forecast evolution process, we characterize the impact of the option to trade and the firms cooperation on equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. Under this model, we prove that the equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation.

## 10. Efficient Monte Carlo and QuasiMonte Carlo Option Pricing Under the Variance Gamma Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2006
### Abstract:
We develop and study efficient Monte Carlo algorithms for pricing path-dependent options with the variance gamma model. The key ingredient is difference-of-gamma bridge sampling, based on the representation of a variance gamma process as the difference of two increasing gamma processes. For typical payoffs, we obtain a pair of estimators (named low and high) with expectations that (1) are monotone along any such bridge sampler, and (2) contain the continuous-time price. These estimators provide pathwise bounds on unbiased estimators that would be more expensive (infinitely expensive in some situations) to compute. By using these bounds with extrapolation techniques, we obtain significant efficiency improvements by work reduction. We then combine the gamma bridge sampling with randomized quasiMonte Carlo to reduce the variance and thus further improve the efficiency. We illustrate the large efficiency improvements on numerical examples for Asian, lookback, and barrier options.

## 11. A Theory of Volatility Spreads
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2006
### Abstract:
This study formalizes the departure between risk-neutral and physical index return volatilities, termed volatility spreads. Theoretically, the departure between risk-neutral and physical index volatility is connected to the higher-order physical return moments and the parameters of the pricing kernel process. This theory predicts positive volatility spreads when investors are risk averse, and when the physical index distribution is negatively skewed and leptokurtic. Our empirical evidence is supportive of the theoretical implications of risk aversion, exposure to tail events, and fatter left-tails of the physical index distribution in markets where volatility is traded.

## 12. Optimal Dynamic Advertising Policy for New Products
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Advertising is one of the key marketing tools managers have at their disposal to influence their customers into purchasing a new product. The overall objective of new product advertising is to inform and persuade customers. Drawing up an advertising plan for a new product that is under the influence of diffusion phenomenon is not an easy task. Hence, research in this area is very limited. In our research, we use an empirically proven diffusion demand function that explicitly incorporates the advertising component. Our results suggest that optimal advertising is determined by the advertising effectiveness, discount rate, and the ratio of advertisement to profits. Depending upon the interplay among these factors, the optimal advertising takes decrease-increase, increase-decrease, monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing shape.
