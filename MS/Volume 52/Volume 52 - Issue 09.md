## 2. Airlines as Baseball Players: Another Approach for Evaluating an Equal-Safety Hypothesis
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Within the First World, observed differences across air carriers in passenger death risk are almost never statistically significant. But given the rarity of fatal crashes, even a lopsided split of crashes across airlines is unlikely to achieve significance. For greater perspective about relative airline safety performance, we supplemented an analysis of overall mortality data with a two-part statistical procedure. The first part—which was inspired by the way the Oakland Athletics Major League baseball team evaluates individual baseball players—allows for a sharp test of a key aspect of an equal-safety hypothesis, related to the frequency with which individual airlines suffer life-threatening events. The second test considers a further aspect of safety, namely the ability to recover from emergencies given that they have occurred. When applied to U.S. domestic jet services over 1983–2002, the test procedures indicate that long-established airlines have been about equally (and hugely) successful in protecting their passengers from accidental death and that established airlines are not demonstrably safer than the “new-entrant” jet carriers formed after U.S. airline deregulation.

## 3. Risk Assessment for Banking Systems

### Abstract:
We propose a new approach to assess systemic financial stability of a banking system using standard tools from modern risk management in combination with a network model of interbank loans. We apply our model to a unique data set of all Austrian banks. We find that correlation in banks' asset portfolios dominates contagion as the main source of systemic risk. Contagion is rare but can nonetheless wipe out a major part of the banking system. Low bankruptcy costs and an efficient crisis resolution policy are crucial to limit the systemwide impact of contagious default events. We compute the “value at risk” for a lender of last resort and find that the funds necessary to prevent contagion are surprisingly small.

## 4. Entrepreneurial Risk and Market Entry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
This paper attempts to reconcile the risk-bearing characterization of entrepreneurs with the stylized fact that entrepreneurs exhibit conventional risk-aversion profiles. We propose that the disparity arises from confounding two distinct dimensions of uncertainty: demand uncertainty and ability uncertainty. We further propose that entrepreneurs will be risk averse with respect to demand uncertainty, yet “apparent risk seeking” (or overconfident) with respect to ability uncertainty. To examine this view, we construct a reduced-form model of the entrepreneur’s entry decision, which we aggregate to the market level, then test empirically. We find that entrepreneurs in aggregate behave as we predict. Accordingly, risk-averse entrepreneurs are willing to bear market risk when the degree of ability uncertainty is comparable to the degree of demand uncertainty. Potential market failures exist in instances where there is a high demand uncertainty but low performance dispersion (insufficient entry), or low demand uncertainty but high performance dispersion (excess entry).

## 5. Opportunity Recognition as the Detection of Meaningful Patterns: Evidence from Comparisons of Novice and Experienced Entrepreneurs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
It is suggested that the recognition of new business opportunities often involves pattern recognition—the cognitive process through which individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of events or trends. Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive frameworks acquired through experience (e.g., prototypes) play a central role in this process. Such frameworks provide individuals with a basis for noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in markets, changes in government policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these connections. We propose that ideas for new products or services often emerge from the perception of such patterns. New business opportunities are identified when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks, “connect the dots” between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then detect patterns in these connections suggestive of new products or services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the “business opportunity” prototypes of novice (first-time) and repeat (experienced) entrepreneurs—their cognitive representations of the essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly defined, richer in content, and more concerned with factors and conditions related to actually starting and running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash flow) than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs. These findings offer support for the view that pattern recognition is a key component of opportunity recognition.

## 6. Project Assignments When Budget Padding Taints Resource Allocation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
This paper shows that rotation programs can be an effective response to concerns of employee budget padding. Rotation programs naturally create a “portfolio” of assignments for each manager, and the resulting diversification can reduce the downside of resource rationing. In particular, the production versus rents trade-off linked with adverse selection problems can be more efficiently carried out when the firm faces two managers with average information advantages, rather than one with a large advantage and one with a small advantage. Roughly stated, rotation of project assignments is a way of smoothing information across managers. On the other hand, if a firm places a premium on treating different types of projects in distinct ways, specialized assignments can be preferred due to the ability to confine project types to individual managers.

## 7. Value Implications of Investments in Information Technology

### Abstract:
The year 2000 (Y2K) countdown provided a uniquely visible instance of spending on information technology (IT) by U.S. companies. With public attention riveted on potential Y2K malfunctions, managers were forced to evaluate their IT and make decisions about whether to modify or replace existing systems. In the aftermath of Y2K, critics charged that the problem was overblown and that companies overspent on IT. In contrast, we posit in this paper that efforts companies made to renew and upgrade their IT may have positioned them to take advantage of new e-business applications. As Y2K approached, managers could invest opportunistically in IT, which would enable them to connect with customers and suppliers in new ways. Contrary to the alleged overspending, we find that firm value increased, on average, with Y2K spending by Fortune 1000 companies. In particular, higher firm value and subsequent earnings were associated with Y2K spending for firms in industries where IT was considered to have a transforming influence—altering traditional ways of doing business by redefining business processes and relationships. We also test whether the positive association between firm value and Y2K spending diminished with Y2K spending by industry peer firms, but we do not find support for this relative investment hypothesis.

## 8. Market Valuation and Employee Stock Options
### Author(s):
- Ge Zhang
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
This paper investigates a market-valuation-based hypothesis for employee stock options (ESOs). Given that stock prices do not track fundamental values perfectly, I show that ESOs can be used to sell overvalued stocks and to increase long-term shareholder value. The key cross-sectional prediction of the valuation rationale is that the conditional probability of granting options to employees and the amount of options granted to them are positively correlated with market valuation and volatility. Moreover, for extremely overvalued firms, the correlation between option grant and market valuation is weaker. Firms that use ESOs can save their regular employee compensation costs. I find strong empirical evidence supporting these predictions.

## 9. Methodologies and Algorithms for Group-Rankings Decision
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
The problem of group ranking, also known as rank aggregation, has been studied in contexts varying from sports, to multicriteria decision making, to machine learning, to ranking Web pages, and to behavioral issues. The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover, the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual decision-makers’ rankings.

## 10. Stochastic Dominance and Cumulative Prospect Theory
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
We generalize and extend the second-order stochastic dominance condition for expected utility to cumulative prospect theory. The new definitions include preferences represented by S-shaped value functions, inverse S-shaped probability weighting functions, and loss aversion. The stochastic dominance conditions supply a framework to test different features of cumulative prospect theory. In the experimental part of the paper, we offer a test of several joint hypotheses on the value function and the probability weighting function. Assuming empirically relevant weighting functions, we can reject the inverse S-shaped value function recently advocated by Levy and Levy (2002) in favor of the S-shaped form. In addition, we find generally supporting evidence for loss aversion. Violations of loss aversion can be explained by subjects using the overall probability of winning as a heuristic.

## 11. Discounting by Intervals: A Generalized Model of Intertemporal Choice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
According to most models of intertemporal choice, an agent's discount rate is a function of how far the outcomes are removed from the present, and nothing else. This view has been challenged by recent studies, which show that discount rates tend to be higher the closer the outcomes are to one another (subadditive discounting) and that this can give rise to intransitive intertemporal choice. We develop and test a generalized model of intertemporal choice, the Discounting By Intervals (DBI) model, according to which the discount rate is a function of both how far outcomes are removed from the present and how far the outcomes are removed from one another. The model addresses past challenges to other models, most of which it includes as special cases, as well as the new challenges presented in this paper: Our studies show that when the interval between outcomes is very short, discount rate tends to increase with interval length (superadditive discounting). In the discussion we place our model and evidence in a broader theoretical context.

## 12. Sequential Observation and Selection with Rank-Dependent Payoffs: An Experimental Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
We consider a class of sequential observation and selection decision problems in which applicants are interviewed one at a time, decision makers only learn the applicant's quality relative to the applicants that have been interviewed and rejected, only a single applicant is selected, and payoffs increase in the absolute quality of the selected applicant. Compared to the optimal decision policy, which we compute numerically, results from two experiments show that subjects terminated their search too early. We competitively test three behavioral decision rules and find that a multithreshold rule, which has the same form as the optimal decision policy but is parameterized differently, best accounts for the data. Results from a probability estimation task show that subjects tend to overestimate the absolute quality of early applicants and give insufficient consideration to the yet-to-be-seen applicants.

## 13. Enhancing a Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Two-Stage Stochastic Integer Network Design-Based Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2006
### Abstract:
In this paper we present branch-and-bound (B&B) strategies for two-stage stochastic integer network design-based models with integrality constraints in the first-stage variables. These strategies are used within L-shaped decomposition-based B&B framework. We propose a valid inequality in order to improve B&B performance. We use this inequality to implement a multirooted B&B tree. A selective use of optimality cuts is explored in the B&B approach and we also propose a subgradient-based technique for branching on 0-1 feasible solutions. Finally, we present computational results for a fixed-charge network design problem with random demands.
