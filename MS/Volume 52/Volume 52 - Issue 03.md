## 2. The Optimizer’s Curse: Skepticism and Postdecision Surprise in Decision Analysis
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Decision analysis produces measures of value such as expected net present values or expected utilities and ranks alternatives by these value estimates. Other optimization-based processes operate in a similar manner. With uncertainty and limited resources, an analysis is never perfect, so these value estimates are subject to error. We show that if we take these value estimates at face value and select accordingly, we should expect the value of the chosen alternative to be less than its estimate, even if the value estimates are unbiased. Thus, when comparing actual outcomes to value estimates, we should expect to be disappointed on average, not because of any inherent bias in the estimates themselves, but because of the optimization-based selection process. We call this phenomenon the optimizer’s curse and argue that it is not well understood or appreciated in the decision analysis and management science communities. This curse may be a factor in creating skepticism in decision makers who review the results of an analysis. In this paper, we study the optimizer’s curse and show that the resulting expected disappointment may be substantial. We then propose the use of Bayesian methods to adjust value estimates. These Bayesian methods can be viewed as disciplined skepticism and provide a method for avoiding this postdecision disappointment.

## 3. Behavioral Causes of the Bullwhip Effect and the Observed Value of Inventory Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
The tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a supply chain is commonly known as the bullwhip effect. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We conduct two experiments on two different sets of participants. In the first, we find the bullwhip effect still exists when normal operational causes (e.g., batching, price fluctuations, demand estimation, etc.) are removed. The persistence of the bullwhip effect is explained to some extent by evidence that decision makers consistently underweight the supply line when making order decisions. In the second experiment, we find that the bullwhip, and the underlying tendency of underweighting, remains when information on inventory levels is shared. However, we observe that inventory information helps somewhat to alleviate the bullwhip effect by helping upstream chain members better anticipate and prepare for fluctuations in inventory needs downstream. These experimental results support the theoretically suggested notion that upstream chain members stand to gain the most from information-sharing initiatives.

## 4. Optimal Component Stocking Policy for Assemble-to-Order Systems with Lead-Time-Dependent Component and Product Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
Short delivery time and the efficient management of component inventories are two crucial elements that determine the competitiveness of many contract assembly manufacturers, especially in the electronics industry. In this paper, we develop and analyze an optimization model to determine the optimal stocking quantities for components of an assemble-to-order product in an environment where demand is uncertain and the price for the final product and the costs of components depend on their delivery lead times. We provide an efficient solution procedure to solve the problem in which the manufacturer must deliver the full order quantity possibly in multiple shipments. We further extend our model to the situation where the manufacturer has the option of not delivering the full quantity but instead takes the penalty for a delivery shortage. We derive some analytical results that illustrate how different model parameters affect the optimal solution and provide useful insights for managing components in the assemble-to-order environment.

## 5. Organizational Learning Curves for Customer Dissatisfaction: Heterogeneity Across Airlines
### Author(s):

- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
In the extensive literature on learning curves, scholars have ignored outcome measures of organizational performance evaluated by customers. We explore whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Do organizations learn to reduce customer dissatisfaction? Customer dissatisfaction occurs when customers’ ex ante expectations about a product or service exceed ex post perceptions about the product or service. Because customers can increase expectations over time, customer dissatisfaction may not decline even when the product or service improves. Consequently, it is an open question whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Drawing from the literatures on learning curves and organizational learning, we hypothesize that customer dissatisfaction follows a U-shaped function of operating experience (Hypothesis 1), that focused airlines learn faster to reduce customer dissatisfaction than full-service airlines (Hypothesis 2), and that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction are heterogeneous across airlines (Hypothesis 3). We test these hypotheses with quarterly data covering 1987 to 1998 on consumer complaints against the 10 largest U.S. airlines. We find strong support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 2 is not supported in the sense that the average focused airline did not learn faster than the average full-service airline. However, we do find that the best focused airline learns faster than the best full-service airline. We explore this result by extending a knowledge-based view of managing productivity learning curves in factories to complaint learning curves in airlines.

## 6. Turning Visitors into Customers: A Usability-Centric Perspective on Purchase Behavior in Electronic Channels
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
We develop a theoretical model for predicting purchase behavior in electronic channels. The model suggests that website use (i.e., technology use), a key indicator of the degree to which a site is “sticky,” is a significant antecedent of purchase behavior. Furthermore, we relate the usability of a website to use behavior and purchase behavior. Specifically, individual characteristics and product type are argued to differentially influence the weights that customers place on five different categories of usability. The weighted ratings of the five categories together determine use behavior and purchase behavior, after controlling for purchase need, experience with similar sites, and previous purchase on the specific sites. The model was tested in a longitudinal field study among 757 customers who provided usability assessments for multiple websites from four different industries—i.e., airlines, online bookstores, automobile manufacturers, and car rental agencies. Six months later, 370 of these individuals provided responses to help understand the transition from visitor to customer, i.e., whether they actually transacted with a specific website. Results provided strong support for the model and yield important theoretical and practical implications.

## 7. How Does Residual Income Affect Investment? The Role of Prior Performance Measures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether “you get what you pay for” in firms that implement residual income (RI)–based compensation. Specifically, this paper explores differences in investment patterns of firms that implement RI-based compensation plans conditional on whether the firms switched from earnings or return on investment (ROI)–based compensation. I find that the pattern of investment for firms switching to RI from earnings-based compensation is opposite to that of firms switching from ROI-based compensation. Changes in investment within each individual subgroup yield weaker, mixed results. In addition, this paper documents that delivered RI increases in firms that implement RI. My paper contributes to the literature on the investment effects of RI by examining the relevance of a set of arguments that have been made in management accounting textbooks since 1965. These arguments are still found in current textbooks and are commonly taught to students in graduate level managerial accounting classes. The arguments help us to examine a natural experiment in which we can better specify the conditions under which RI use is expected to be associated with changes in investment.

## 8. The Effectiveness of Simple Decision Heuristics: Forecasting Commercial Success for Early-Stage Ventures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
We investigate the decision heuristics used by experts to forecast that early-stage ventures are subsequently commercialized. Experts evaluate 37 project characteristics and subjectively combine data on all cues by examining both critical flaws and positive factors to arrive at a forecast. A conjunctive model is used to describe their process, which sums “good” and “bad” cue counts separately. This model achieves a 91.8% forecasting accuracy of the experts’ correct forecasts. The model correctly predicts 86.0% of outcomes in out-of-sample, out-of-time tests. Results indicate that reasonably simple decision heuristics can perform well in a natural and very difficult decision-making context.

## 9. Improving Preference Assessment: Limiting the Effect of Context Through Pre-exposure to Attribute Levels
### Author(s):
- Kurt A. Carlson
- Samuel D. Bond
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a technique for improving preference assessment by reducing the influence of context on preferential choices. We propose that a decision maker who is exposed to relevant attribute levels will form spontaneous valuations, which will then insulate the decision maker from the effects of context during subsequent preference assessment. Results from three studies supported this hypothesis. Pre-exposure to product attribute levels undermined the impact of attribute priming, decision framing, and asymmetric dominance on preferential choices. A fourth study demonstrated that similar results can be obtained by allowing decision makers to pregenerate lists of attribute levels on their own.

## 10. Behavioral Estimation of Mathematical Programming Objective Function Coefficients
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
We propose a parameter estimation method based on what we call the minimum decisional regret principle. We focus on mathematical programming models with objective functions that depend linearly on costs or other parameters. The approach is illustrated for cost estimation in production planning using linear programming models. The method uses past planning data to estimate costs that are otherwise difficult to estimate. We define a monetary measure of distance between observed plans and optimal ones, called decisional regret. The proposed estimation algorithm finds parameter values for which the associated optimal plans are as near as possible to the observed ones on average. Such techniques may be called behavioral estimation because they are based on the observed planning or decision-making behavior of managers or firms. Two numerical illustrations are given. A supporting hyperplane algorithm is used to solve the estimation model. A method is proposed for obtaining range estimates of the parameters when multiple alternative estimates exist. We also propose a new validation approach for this estimation principle, which we call the target-mode agreement criterion.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used to elicit partworth utilities for product attributes from consumers to aid in the evaluation of market potential for new products. The objective of the share-of-choice problem (a common approach to new product design) is to find the design that maximizes the number of respondents for whom the new product’s utility exceeds a specific hurdle (reservation utility). We present an exact branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the share-of-choice problem. Our empirical results, based on several large commercial data sets and simulated data from a controlled experiment, suggest that the approach is useful for finding provably optimal solutions to realistically sized problems, including cases where partworths contain estimation error.

## 12. Environmental Volatility, Development Decisions, and Software Volatility: A Longitudinal Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
Although product development research often focuses on activities prior to product launch, for long-lived, adaptable products like software, development can continue over the entire product life cycle. For managers of these products the challenges are to predict when and how much the products will change and to understand how their development decisions influence the timing and magnitude of future change activities. We develop a two-stage model that relates environmental volatility to product development decisions and product development decisions to software volatility. The model is evaluated using a data archive that captures changes over 20 years to a firm’s environment, its managers’ development choices, and its software products. In Stage 1 we find that higher environmental volatility leads to greater use of process technology and standard component designs but less team member rotation. Earlier development decisions strongly influence current development choices, especially for product design and process technology. In Stage 2 we find that increased use of standard component designs dampens future software volatility by decreasing the average rate and magnitude of change. Adding new team members increases product enhancements at a faster pace than more intense use of process technology but adds repairs at almost the same rate as enhancements.

## 13. Research Note—Sell First, Fix Later: Impact of Patching on Software Quality
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2006
### Abstract:
We present a model of fixing or patching a software problem after the product has been released in the market. Specifically, we model a software firm’s trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and investments in fixing it later. Just as the marginal cost of producing software can be effectively zero, so can the marginal cost of repairing multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a software vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it later in a larger market. Thus, a software monopolist releases a product with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We contrast this result with physical good markets where market size does not play any role in quality provision. We also show that for comparable costs, a software monopolist releases the product with more bugs but invests more in post-patching support later than the physical good monopolist.
