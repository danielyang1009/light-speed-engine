### Abstract:
Faced with fragmented markets, saturated and demanding customers, and global competition, firms increasingly must design and offer a line of innovative, quality-differentiated products to target customers with differing willingness to pay (WTP). In this context, designing a special class of products that we term development-intensive products (DIPs)—for which the fixed costs of development far outweigh the unit-variable costs—presents some unique managerial challenges. Examples of such development-intensive offerings abound in a number of industries, including the pharmaceutical, information, and entertainment sectors of the economy. Our contributions in this paper are threefold: (a) to show that managerial insights from the traditional approach to product-line design developed for unit-variable cost-intensive products do not carry over to DIPs, (b) to present new mechanisms and managerial guidelines for designing a family of products for which development costs cannot be ignored, and (c) to illustrate the insights with an extended industry example. We find that the design approach based on degrading (or subtracting value from) a high-end product to obtain a subsumed low-end edition, shown in the literature to be an effective approach for designing unit cost-intensive products, can be inappropriate for DIPs. This limitation of value subtraction has implications for the number of variants and the sequence in which they are developed. As an alternative to a subsumed product-design strategy, we propose and examine the overlapped product-design approach, in which a low-end product is not completely subsumed within its high-end counterpart, but differentiated on additional vertical quality dimensions. Our results both explain the recent challenges of firms with subsumed low-end products and guide them in designing a product line to successfully address emerging low-end market segments.

## 3. Technological Development and the Boundaries of the Firm: A Knowledge-Based Examination in Semiconductor Manufacturing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
This paper examines how the knowledge-based view (KBV) can be applied to firm boundary decisions and the performance implications of those decisions. At the center of the paper is a theoretical and empirical examination of how firms most efficiently organize to solve different types of problems related to technological development, using the semiconductor industry as the empirical setting. Measures that capture important dimensions of performance support the proposition that organization affects performance in problem solving related to knowledge development. Integrated firms realize performance advantages when problem solving in technological development is ill structured and complex, while the same is true for specialized firms when problem solving in technological development is well structured and simple. Performance differences also arise from the presence of scale economies and scope economies.

## 4. Supply Chain Choice on the Internet
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Internet companies extensively use the practice of drop-shipping, where the wholesaler stocks and owns the inventory and ships products directly to customers at retailers’ request. Under the drop-shipping arrangement, the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler’s. Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in which retailers stock and own the inventory. These two supply chain structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability, the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and transportation costs.

## 5. A Bargaining Model for a First-Time Interaction Under Asymmetric Beliefs of Supply Reliability
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We consider the case of a first-time interaction between a buyer and a supplier who is unreliable in delivery. The supplier declares her estimate of the ability to meet the order obligations, but the buyer may have a different estimate, which may be higher or lower than the supplier’s estimate. We derive the Nash bargaining solution and discuss the role of using a down-payment or nondelivery penalty in the contract. For the case of buyer overtrust, the down-payment contract maximizes channel profits when the supplier’s estimate is public information. If the supplier’s estimate is private information, a nonsymmetric contract is shown to be efficient and incentive compatible. For the case of buyer undertrust, the contract structure is quite different as both players choose not to include down-payments in the contract. When delivery estimates are public information, a nondelivery penalty contract is able to maximize channel profits if the buyer uses the supplier’s estimate in making the ordering decision. If estimates are private information, channel profits are maximized only if the true estimates of both players are not far part. We also discuss the effect of different risk profiles on the nature of the bargaining solution. In three extensions of the model, we consider the following variants of the basic problem. First, we analyze the effect of early versus late negotiation on the bargaining solution. Then, we study the case of endogenous supply reliability, and finally, for the case of repeated interactions, we discuss the impact of updating delivery estimates on the order quantity and negotiated prices of future orders.

## 6. Procuring Fast Delivery: Sole Sourcing with Information Asymmetry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
This paper studies a queuing model in which a buyer sources a good or service from a single supplier chosen from a pool of suppliers. The buyer seeks to minimize the sum of her procurement and operating costs, the latter of which depends on the supplier’s lead time. The selected supplier can regulate his lead time, but faster lead times are costly. Although the buyer selects the supplier to source from (possibly via an auction) and dictates the contractual terms, the buyer’s bargaining power is limited by asymmetric information: The buyer only has an estimate of the suppliers’ costs, while the suppliers know their costs precisely. We identify a procurement mechanism that minimizes the buyer’s total cost (procurement plus operating). This mechanism is not simple: It is a numerically derived nonlinear menu of contracts. Therefore, we study several simpler mechanisms: e.g., one that charges a late fee and one that specifies a fixed lead-time requirement (no menus, no nonlinear functions). We find that simple mechanisms are nearly optimal (generally within 1% of optimal) because asymmetric information conveys significant protection to the supplier, i.e., the supplier is able to retain most of the benefit of having a lower cost. Renegotiation is another concern with the optimal mechanism: Because it does not minimize the supply chain’s cost, the firms can be both better off if they throw away the contract and start over. Interestingly, we find that the potential gain from renegotiation is relatively small with either the optimal or our simple mechanisms. We conclude that our simple mechanisms are quite attractive along all relevant dimensions: buyer’s performance, supply chain performance, simplicity, and robustness to renegotiation.

## 7. Exploring Decision Makers’ Use of Price Information in a Speculative Market

### Abstract:
We explore the extent to which the decisions of participants in a speculative market effectively account for information contained in prices and price movements. The horse race betting market is an ideal environment to explore these issues. A conditional logit model is constructed to determine winning probabilities based on bookmakers’ closing prices and the time-indexed movement of prices to the market close. We incorporate a technique for extracting predictors from price (odds) curves using orthogonal polynomials. The results indicate that closing prices do not fully incorporate market price information, particularly information that is less readily discernable by market participants.

## 8. Identifying Sources of Heterogeneity for Empirically Deriving Strategic Types: A Constrained Finite-Mixture Structural-Equation Methodology

### Published:

### Abstract:
The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm suggests that strategic deployment of capabilities allows strategic business units (SBUs) to exploit distinctive competencies and create sustainable competitive advantage. Following the RBV, we propose a new predictive methodology for deriving typologies of SBUs that accommodates heterogeneity among SBUs with respect to their strategic capabilities, how effectively they are employed, and performance. Statistically, we devise a constrained finite-mixture structural-equation procedure that simultaneously accounts for firm capabilities, performance outcomes, and the relationships between them. The procedure allows for a comprehensive modeling and grouping of entities, and simultaneously provides a diagnosis of the sources of heterogeneity via the flexibility of estimating a series of nested models. Managerially, our proposed methodology is grounded in the strategic type and RBV literature and can capture the effects of environmental and industry-specific factors. Using data obtained from 216 SBUs in the United States for illustration, the results show that our derived four mixed-type solution dominates the four-group, Prospectors-Analyzers-Defenders-Reactors classification as well as a number of other nested model solutions in terms of objective statistical fit criteria for this data set, suggesting a more contingency-driven strategic stance adopted by these SBUs. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial benefits of an improved methodology for empirically deriving strategic typologies.

## 9. Reclaiming Quasi–Monte Carlo Efficiency in Portfolio Value-at-Risk Simulation Through Fourier Transform
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
Quasi–Monte Carlo methods overcome the problem of sample clustering in regular Monte Carlo simulation and have been shown to improve simulation efficiency in the derivatives pricing literature when the price is expressed as a multidimensional integration and the integrand is suitably smooth. For portfolio value-at-risk (VaR) problems, the distribution of portfolio value change is based on the expectation of an indicator function, hence the integrand is discontinuous. The purpose of this paper is to smooth the expectation estimation of an indicator function via Fourier transform so that the faster convergence rate of quasi–Monte Carlo methods can be reclaimed theoretically. Under fairly mild assumptions, the simulation of portfolio value-at-risk is fast and accurate. Numerical examples elucidate the advantage of the proposed approach over regular Monte Carlo and quasi–Monte Carlo methods.

## 10. Personal Taxes, Endogenous Default, and Corporate Bond Yield Spreads
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
Term structure models have often been criticized for failing to explain satisfactorily the yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds. A potential problem is that the personal tax effect is ignored in these models. In this paper, we employ a structural model to investigate the role of personal taxes on both debt and equity returns in capital structure decisions and assess their impact on corporate bond yield spreads. It is shown that personal taxes affect the firm’s optimal capital structure, and the tax premium explains a substantial portion of yield spreads, especially for high-grade bonds. The predictive ability of the model for yield spreads is much improved when personal tax effects are accounted for. In controlling for the liquidity effect, we obtain implied personal income tax rates closely in line with Graham’s (1999) estimates.

## 11. Static Mean-Variance Analysis with Uncertain Time Horizon
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
We generalize Markowitz analysis to the situations involving an uncertain exit time. Our approach preserves the form of the original problem in that an investor minimizes portfolio variance for a given level of the expected return. However, inputs are now given by the generalized expressions for mean and variance-covariance matrix involving moments of the random exit time in addition to the conditional moments of asset returns. Although efficient frontiers in the generalized and the standard Markowitz case may coincide under certain conditions, we demonstrate that, by means of an example, in general that is not true. In particular, portfolios efficient in the standard Markowitz sense can be inefficient in the generalized sense and vice versa. As a result, an investor facing an uncertain time horizon and investing as if her time of exit is certain would in general make suboptimal portfolio allocation decisions. Numerical simulations show that a significant efficiency loss can be induced by an improper use of standard mean-variance analysis when time horizon is uncertain.

## 12. Competitive Advertising Strategies and Market-Size Dynamics: A Research Note on Theory and Evidence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2006
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes competing firms’ advertising strategies in markets characterized by dynamic market sizes. For new product innovations, a large literature has been developed on the basis of the celebrated Bass diffusion process, which captures what we call market-size dynamics. However, in spite of the significant literature incorporating competitiveness into the Bass model, few if any analytical results have been obtained, especially those with normative implications. On the other hand, important theoretical and empirical insights have recently been obtained using the famous Lanchester warfare model of competition, in which market-share dynamics are governed by advertising activities for mature products whose market sizes are typically fixed or stable. Our paper seeks to address the issue of optimal advertising strategies incorporating both market-share dynamics and market-size dynamics. In doing so, we seek to take advantage of the theoretical and normative insights currently available in the Lanchester formulation for mature products to obtain normative, analytical results on competitive advertising strategies for new product innovations whose markets evolve around the Bass process. We first obtain analytical solutions to the problem at hand and offer theoretical implications for competitive advertising on the Bass diffusion model. The model’s parameters are then estimated using a set of data on sales and advertising expenditures of Polaroid Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co. in instant photography during the 1976–1985 period; optimal trajectories for the firms’ advertising spending are then calculated, and other marketing and managerial implications of optimal advertising strategies are explored.
