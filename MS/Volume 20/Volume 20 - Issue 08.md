## 1. Autonomy, Gratification and R & D Outputs: A Small-Sample Field Study
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
Thirty-two research and development scientists working under high and low autonomy conditions were studied for differences in attitudes and behavior, and their (thirty-two) one-man projects were studied for differences in output levels. High autonomy development scientists were found to have higher levels of work gratification and interpersonal compatibility than their low autonomy counterparts. For research scientists, no such attitudinal and behavioral differences were found between high and low autonomy conditions. Development projects were found to have generally higher levels of outputs than research projects, where outputs were measured in terms of the percent technical problems solved and the project degree of achievement. However, for both research and development projects, the output levels did not vary with the degree of autonomy. Taken together, the detailed results indicate that the work orientation of a project, research or development, can have a significant influence on project outputs. By contrast, the degree of autonomy may only influence certain attitudinal and behavioral dimensions, which may be unrelated to output levels. These results are consistent with the conventional wisdoms, and their implications for management are largely in accord with modern management practices.

## 2. The Researcher and the Manager: A Comparative View of the Need for Mutual Understanding
### Author(s):
- W. Jack Duncan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
This paper concerns itself with the problem of managerial implementation of scientific research. It employs a survey technique designed to test the manager's and researcher's reactions to propositions developed by Churchman and Schainblatt [Churchman, C. W., A. H. Schainblatt. 1965. The researcher and the manager: A dialectic of implementation. Management Sci. (February) B-16B-87.], Bennis [Bennis, W. G. 1965. Commentary. Management Sci. (October) B-13B-16.], and Dyckman [Dyckman, Thomas R. 1967. Management implementation of scientific research: An attitudinal study. Management Sci. (June) B-612B-619.]. The sample surveyed reflects opinions derived from groups unlike those studied to date.

## 3. A Search Procedure for Policy Oriented Simulations: Applications to Urban Dynamics
### Author(s):
- Carl W. Nelson
- Harold M. Krisbergh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
The application of a computerized optimum-seeking search procedure, called Razor Search, to large-scale simulation experiments is presented using the language of control theory. Results of the search procedure's use with the Urban Dynamics model are given and discussed.

## 4. An Algorithm for Optimal Inventory Policies For Systems with Joint Setup Costs
### Author(s):
- D. J. Hartfiel
- G. L. Curry
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm inventory policies for a class of multi-product dependent setup cost problems. The operational policy under consideration is to replenish jointly, at a reduced cost, all products of the dependent class which are to be ordered in a scheduling period. Demands are assumed to be random with known probability distributions. Convergence of the iterative algorithm, to the optimal solution under suitable hypotheses is proven. Comparisons with the results of a simpler algorithm by Simmons demonstrate the cost advantages of our method.

## 5. A Pattern Recognition Model for Forecasting
### Author(s):
- H. Russell Fogler
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
Corporate planning has been increasingly assisted by advances in the three major areas of economic forecasting: (1) econometric models, (2) time-series analysis, and (3) business cycle indicators. The purpose of this article is to examine the effect of pre-classifying economic observations into more homogeneous groups (patterns). It will be shown that the formation of these groups adds further power to our more standard techniques of statistical inference.

## 6. Optimal Weighted Ancestry Relationships
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
- T. Klastorin
- D. Kongman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
A solution method is given for a class of practical optimization problems requiring the determination of a consistent partial ordering for sets of objects, events, preferences, and the like. These problems are characterized by the existence of noisy (or contradictory) links of varying strengths. The origin of this class of problems is an anthropological study in which it is desired to specify a global chronological ordering of ancient cemetery data. A mathematical formulation is given which results in a minimum weight feedback model. A heuristic is developed similar to the Greedy algorithm for minimum weight spanning trees which requires only one pass through the network.

## 7. Optimal Location of Inspection Stations in a Multistage Production Process
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Eppen
- E. Gerald Hurst, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
A method for determining where to locate the inspection stations in a multistage production process with imperfect inspection is presented. Dynamic programming is used to establish that the optimal expected total cost function at every stage is piecewise linear and concave. While the optimal policy at every stage usually consists of one inspect region and one do not inspect region, this policy structure is found not to hold in general. A computation scheme based directly on the dynamic programming formulation is proposed, a time-sharing computer program is discussed, and the results of an example problem are presented.

## 8. Optimal Control of a Graded Manpower System
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
- Robert E. Stanford
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
We consider a fractional flow model of a graded manpower system and develop algorithms for calculating optimal control policies in four situations: (i) finite time horizons with no constraints on staff distributions, (ii) finite time horizon with constraints on final staff distribution, (iii) infinite horizon with constraints on staff distribution and (iv) problems with a nonstationary transient stage and an infinite stationary stage. In each case results developed in solving the simpler problems are useful in analyzing more complicated situations. In addition to providing computational procedures we apply the algorithms to a three rank model and discuss the possible uses and limitations of our procedure.

## 9. Mathematical Programming Models for the Determination of Attribute Weights
### Author(s):
- Dov Pekelman
- Subrata K. Sen
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1974
### Abstract:
Several versions of a mathematical programming model which determines attribute weights for each consumer are empirically eavluated using data on dry cereals and automobiles. The model is found to be a good predictor of consumer preferences, particularly for dry cereals. Managerial implications for product repositioning, new product design, and market segmentation are discussed in the paper.
