## 1. On Evaluating the Scientific Contribution of the Apollo Moon Missions Via Information Theory: A Study of the Scientist-Scientist Relationship
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
This paper describes the difficulties in evaluating large-scale scientific programs. These difficulties are illustrated through a single case study of the Apollo moon program. The paper describes some of the results of a three and a half year investigation into the beliefs of 42 of the most eminent scientists who studied the moon rocks. The effect of the Apollo missions on the beliefs of the scientists with respect to certain key scientific hypotheses is measured by means of information theory. The paper shows why greater collaborative efforts between the physical and the social sciences are required if there are to develop better tools of evaluation, and ultimately, if we are to develop more informed models of science. The study [Mitroff, Ian I. 1974. The Subjective Side of Science: A Philosophical Enquiry into the Psychology of the Apollo Moon Scientists. Elsevier, forthcoming.] on which this paper is based documents the tremendous role that “irrational” factors play in the attainment of scientific objectivity. We need better models of science that are based, if only in part, on what scientists actually do.

## 2. When to Hedge Against Devaluation

### Abstract:
The treasurer of a multi-national corporation can hedge to protect his corporation against an impending currency devaluation or revaluation. He can cover a future period, τ, now, without covering any intervening periods, by selling the suspect currency forward for τ periods and buying it forward for τ − 1 periods. There are generally no external economies resulting from hedging for more than one period at a time so that the problem is formulated to analyze each period separately. The cost of hedging (for corporate sized amounts) appears to be linear so the hedging price for each period is treated as a constant. Given current costs, expectations of costs, and expectations of probable devaluations or revaluations, should the treasurer now contract to hedge a particular period or should he wait? (The aggregation of the past and current hedge decisions constitutes the intervals to be hedged now.) Each of these hedge or wait decisions is formulated as a dynamic program. This dynamic program fortunately distills down to a very simple decision rule of comparing the expected cost of hedging with a constant for that period when unhedging is permitted. Even when the spread between the buying and selling rates is significant, there will be a need to solve numerically a dynamic program for only a few of the periods. We present and analyse four situations:
Hedging with no unhedging.
Hedging with the option of unhedging later, but with a spread between buying and selling costs.
Hedging in the face of a key event that will branch the probabilities.
Hedging when there's a chance of more than one devaluation.

## 3. Organizational Structure and Technology: A Computer Model Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
The explanation of organizational structure has always been an important issue to administrative theorists. This paper investigates the structure of manufacturing operations and therefore starts from the premise that technological factors are most crucial. One current approach to structure and technology, comparative analysis, has studied the overall context but at a highly aggregative level. The “constituent” approach, on the other hand, has investigated intraorganizational relationships but at the expense of empirically verifiable theory. We develop a heuristic computer model capable of testing existing constituent theories. The model uses work flow data as technological inputs and produces a structural configuration as output. It employs administrative rules (based on Thompson's propositions for structuring the technical core) to convert inputs into outputs. The inputs, outputs, and rules are formally represented using list processing concepts. Operationalizing the formal concepts has been satisfactorily explored in a pilot study of a small manufacturing firm. Testing existing constituent theory is just the initial phase of this project. It is possible to develop new structural theory for the technical core and the rest of the organization, and to engage in a form of comparative analysis to judge the effects of varying contexts. Moreover, the fact that a structural configuration is produced implies utility in the area of design.

## 4. Planning Human Capital Structure: A Study of Economic, Demographic and Educational Determinants
### Author(s):
- Manoucher Parvin
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
There exists a need in less—as well as more—advanced economies for human resource development as an integral part of a planning program and a means of avoiding structural or sectoral unemployment. As a first approximation in planning a human capital structure for a given country, a set of ratios such as students per teacher, inhabitants per physician, nurse or lawyer, etc., may be considered a long-run plan objective. In this paper, economic as well as demographic and educational factors and parameters are used to construct a production function for human capital structure which is called the technical model. The technical model is subsequently used as a constraint in the determination and analysis of the least-cost condition of achieving alternative plans.

## 5. Generalized Equivalent Integer Programs and Canonical Problems
### Author(s):
- Bruce Faaland
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
The theory of equivalent integer programs is generalized so that a set of minimal canonical problems always exists within each equivalence class. An example is used to demonstrate how highly computation time depends on the particular canonical problem chosen to be solved by implicit enumeration algorithms.

## 6. Scheduling a Full-Time Workforce to Meet Cyclic Staffing Requirements
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
A simple algorithm is developed for the problem of assigning days off to full-time staff given a cyclic seven-day demand pattern. The formulation assumes that employees are entitled to two consecutive days off each week and that the objective is to find a minimum staff size capable of meeting the requirements. The algorithm involves only hand calculations, and its computing effort is predictable.

## 7. A Goal Programming Approach to Aggregate Planning of Production and Work Force
### Author(s):
- David A. Goodman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents a goal programming approach to the problem of scheduling aggregate production and work force. The approach is illustrated via two case applications. Numeric results are derived and compared to those of two other approaches. The results suggest that goal programming may be an effective approach for solving certain types of planning models.
