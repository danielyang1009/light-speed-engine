## 1. A Modified Linear Learning Model of Buyer Behavior
### Author(s):
- Gary L. Lilien
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
A stochastic model of individual buyer behavior is developed from a set of postulates about the buying process. The postulates are shown to imply a linear learning model modified by a term to explain response to pricing stimuli. Thus, a customer's purchasing probability is modelled as a combination of the effect of his past purchasing behavior plus the effect of price-variation in the market. Methods are developed to calculate short- and long-term probabilistic properties of the process. A method for parameter estimation is included. The model differs from past modelling efforts in this area in that a controllable variable, product price, is explicitly included in the model-structure, allowing the model to be used to aid in pricing decision making under a certain set of assumptions about competitive behavior in a market situation.

## 2. General Planning Horizons for Production Smoothing with Deterministic Demands
### Author(s):
- Howard C. Kunreuther
- Thomas E. Morton
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
In Part I of this paper, we developed an algorithm for finding planning horizons for the deterministic production smoothing problem when all demand was required to be met from regular production, under rather general assumptions for the production, production smoothing, and holding cost functions. Here, in Part II, we develop analogous planning horizons when the model is extended to include such factors as overtime, lost sales, simple subcontracting, undertime, and backlogging. Part II depends heavily on Part I.

## 3. Simplifying the Choice between Uncertain Prospects Where Preference is Nonlinear
### Author(s):
- John S. Hammond, III
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
This work makes analytical progress in reducing or avoiding two practical difficulties in using preference or utility theory in the analysis of decisions involving uncertainty: (1) assessing the preference curve, and (2) doing calculations with the resultant curve, which may not have an analytically-convenient functional form. The paper identifies circumstances under which simplifications can be found which overcome these difficulties, while at the same time properly reflecting attitude towards risk in the analysis.

## 4. Labor Flexibility in Multiechelon Dual-Constraint Job Shops
### Author(s):
- John S. Frye
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
In this paper a simulation study of the effects of labor flexibility on the performance of a multiechelon dual-constraint job shop is described. Machines and workers are constraining resources in the hypothetical shop. The organizational structure of the shop consists of divisions comprised of work centers that contain machines and workers. There are fewer workers than machines. Independent variables are interdivisional and intradivisional labor flexibility. Mean flow-time, flow-time variance and worker transfers between divisions and work centers are used as measures of shop performance.

## 5. A Multi Product Joint Ordering Model with Dependent Setup Cost
### Author(s):
- Chung-Mei Ho Chern
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
A multi product, continuous review inventory model with dependent setup cost is studied and a joint ordering policy is defined. The development of the model is based on the independent (R, Q) policy. A can order point is derived for each product such that if the inventory level of one product drops to its reorder point, all products with inventory level less than or equal to their can order points are ordered together. The analytic results are given for the unit Poisson demands. Simulation experiments are used to compare the joint ordering policy with the independent ordering policy for the case of Stuttering Poisson demands. It is learned that the joint ordering policy achieves a substantial saying in total cost over the independent ordering policy.

## 6. A Generalized Discrete Dynamic Programming Model
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
This paper considers a stationary discrete dynamic programming model that is a generalization of the finite state and finite action Markov programming problem. We specify conditions under which an optimal stationary linear decision rule exists and show how this optimal policy can be calculated using linear programming, policy iteration, or value iteration. In addition we allow the parameters of the problem to be random variables and indicate when the expected values or these random variables are certainty equivalents.

## 7. Optimal Policies for a Multi-Echelon Inventory Problem with Periodic Ordering
### Author(s):
- Felipe K. Tan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
A central warehouse supplies two facilities with a product. The facilities are subject in each time period to stochastic demands. The warehouse can allocate stock to the facilities in each period, but can reorder from an exogenous source only after every T periods. Assuming convex holding and shortage costs, linear ordering and allocation costs, backlogging and no transshipment between facilities, the optimal ordering and allocation policies are characterized. It is also shown that after the last ordering instant, the optimal allocation policy reduces to a much simpler form when the cost-functions are separable in their variables, and that results on the zero time lag allocation problem apply to the fixed time lag case when the holding and shortage costs are functions only of the facility inventories and the total system inventory.

## 8. Cost Minimizing Single Sampling Plans with AIQL and AOQL Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
This paper investigates and formulates the relationships among average incoming quality limit (AIQL), production process quality level and average fraction defective after production process for a single-stage manufacturing connected-unit situation. Cost components of the system are identified. In order to derive minimum cost single sampling plans where inspection is by attribute, a mathematical model is developed and plans are obtained using discrete optimization for the total expected loss function subject to AIQL and AOQL equality constraints.

## 9. Optimal Production Smoothing and Safety Inventory
### Author(s):
- Christoph A. Schneeweiss
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
A new approach is suggested to solve a production smoothing problem. The problem is divided essentially into two subproblems. First the derivation of the optimal smoothing policy is given for a model having a quadratic cost structure. The second step then takes into account the special features of the actually given nonquadratic cost functions. In the framework of a special model the applicability of this approach is discussed.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1974
### Abstract:
The purposes of this paper are (i) to study the price structure that should be set to charge the services of a facility subject to queueing phenomena, (ii) to state a rule to determine the optimal capacity of such a facility, and (iii) to investigate if customers could be left free to choose their own priorities.

### Published:

### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to present a computationally attractive view of sensitivity analysis in geometric programming. The approach is motivated by the need to obtain numerical solutions to large-scale geometric programs and provides a summary of some sensitivity analysis results in a readily usable computational form.
