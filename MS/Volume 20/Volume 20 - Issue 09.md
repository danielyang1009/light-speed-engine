## 1. Decision Analysis Expert Use
### Author(s):
- Peter A. Morris
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
This paper is the first in a series of articles introducing a new conceptual and methodological framework for the use of experts in decision situations. Presented is the first theory of expert resolution wholly consistent with the Bayesian or subjectivist view of probability. The approach taken rests philosophically on the foundations of decision analysis. The results form practical tools for solving expert resolution problems.

## 2. Representational Systems Theory
### Author(s):
- Frederick Betz
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
The methodology of simulation involves a representational approach to observed phenomena. Systems theory has been, in the past, more terminology than theory. However, a logical classification of the possible representational forms available for any simulation would serve as a meta-theory in simulation methodology.

## 3. Multi-Echelon Production Scheduling When Demand is Stochastic
### Author(s):
- Jack F. William
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents a dynamic programming algorithm for determining optimal production in a series type multi-echelon inventory system with stochastic final product demand. Setup costs at individual facilities are permitted. For the case where it is physically possible (but not required) for a product unit to pass through all the facilities within a single time period, a second dynamic programming algorithm is presented which can be used in conjunction with the first to substantially decrease computation time. The model can also be readily specialized to the case of deterministic demand and permits a larger class of cost functions than existing deterministic multi-echelon models.

## 4. Job Shop Scheduling with Due Dates and Variable Processing Times
### Author(s):
- C. A. Holloway
- R. T. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
A multi-pass heuristic scheduling procedure developed for job scheduling problems with deterministic processing times is tested with processing times that are random variables. The heuristic procedure, which uses expected processing times, typically generates a delay schedule (i.e., a schedule in which some operations are delayed while the machine to process these operations is kept idle awaiting the arrival of another operation). Simulation is employed to compare the performance of the schedule generated by the heuristic procedure, a nondelay transformation of that schedule, and the nondelay schedules obtained with four single-pass dispatching rules. The criteria employed are fraction of jobs tardy, mean tardiness, variance of tardiness, and maximum tardiness. The delay schedule produced by the heuristic procedure was found to be markedly superior under certain conditions. Under other conditions, the relative performance of the scheduling rules appears highly problem dependent. Implications of these results are discussed with respect to further research.

## 5. Inventory Depletion Management When the Field Life is Random
### Author(s):
- Steven Nahmias
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of describing optimal issuing policies when the field life, X(s), is a nonnegative random variable. A new optimality criterion involving stochastic ordering is introduced and sufficient conditions given for the optimality of FIFO and LIFO. Two specific models of perishable inventory are then considered; Model I allows for the perishing of items in the stockpile and Model II does not. It is demonstrated that both LIFO and FIFO are optimal for Model I when the items age at the same rate in the stockpile as in the field. Under the assumption that X(s) is uniformly distributed the optimality of FIFO is established for Model II.

## 6. The Triangular E-Model of Chance-Constrained Programming with Stochastic A-Matrix
### Author(s):
- Willy F. Gochet
- Manfred W. Padberg
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
The triangular model of chance-constrained programming with stochastic A-matrix and deterministic right-hand side is considered. The use of conditional probabilities makes it possible to solve this problem for any type of distribution function of the elements of the A-matrix provided that there is only one decision variable at each stage. The extension of the model to several decision variables per stage is possible under certain conditions and for special distribution (stable distributions) of the elements of A.

## 7. The Geometry of Solution Concepts for N-Person Cooperative Games
### Author(s):
- Richard Spinetto
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
The closed convex polyhedron consisting of all 0-1 normal n-person games with nonempty core is characterized by naming its extreme points. This characterization establishes a geometric setting, in the game space itself, for such solution concepts as the core and the nucleolus. This geometric setting also suggests new solution concepts. A similar geometric setting is also established for the Shapley value, and core and nucleolus solution concepts can be defined in this geometric setting.

## 8. Dynamics of Exponential Smoothing with Trend and Seasonal Terms
### Author(s):
- John O. McClain
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
The characteristics of seasonally adjusted, exponentially smoothed forecasts are studied through the frequency response and impulse response functions. The appropriateness of using exponential smoothing for updating the seasonal base series is called into question, due to its tendency to store random noise for long periods.

## 9. Some Further Thoughts on the Minimax Principle
### Author(s):
- Morton Davis
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
In a recent paper Aumann and Maschler [Aumann, R. J., M. Maschler. 1972. Some thoughts on the minimax principle. Management Sci.18 (5, Part 2, January) P-54.] (we will subsequently refer to them as A-M) raised some questions about certain matters that had long been considered settled. In their words,
It is generally agreed that the minimax solution to a two-person zero-sum matrix game is intuitively satisfactory. Now in many applications of game theory a game is not described in matrix (or normal or strategic) form, but rather in extensive form, i.e., by its rules. A game described in such a way may be reduced to a matrix game by means of the concept of strategy. If, moreover, it is of perfect recall, then all mixed strategies, and in particular the optimal strategies of each player, are equivalent to behavior strategies The usual conclusion from these considerations is that for 2-person 0-sum games in extensive form, the minimax solution is intuitively satisfactory, and that in games of perfect recall, in particular, the players would do well to play in accordance with optimal (minimax) behavior strategies. In this paper we shall discuss some examples that, we believe, cast doubt on these conclusions.

## 10. NoteDynamic Facility Location and Simple Network Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
Wesolowsky [Wesolowsky, G. O. 1973. Dynamic facility location. Management Sci.19 (11, July) 12411248.] has examined a dynamic version of the location problem for a single facility, obtained by allowing relocation of the facility over time to optimize a cost or benefit expression. This problem is essentially one of facility replacement, and may be expressed and solved through a simple network model as in deterministic equipment replacement situations ([Veinott, A. F., Jr., H. M. Wagner. 1962. Optimal capacity and schedulingI. Oper. Res.10 (4, JulyAugust) 518532 and Wagner, H. M. 1969. Principles of Operations Research. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, pp. 180181 and pp. 340342.]).

## 12. NoteTwo Comments on the Deterministic Capacity Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
Giglio's paper [Giglio, R. J. 1973. A note on the deterministic capacity problem. Management Sci.19 (9, May).] on capacity expansion and its primary reference [Srinivasan, T. N. 1967. Geometric rate of growth of demand. A. S. Manne, ed. Investments for Capacity Expansion. MIT Press, 150156.] overlook a relevant earlier result of Sinden [Sinden, F. W. 1960. The replacement and expansion of durable equipment. J. Soc. Indus. Appl. Math.8 (September) 466480.]. All three papers model a situation in which demand g(t) is increasing in t and must, for all t, be accommodated by prior installation(s) of capacity.

## 13. NoteA Replacement Problem using a Wald Identity for Discounted Variables
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Serfozo
### Published:
- 1 May 1974
### Abstract:
A fundamental model is presented for determining optimal replacement times for stochastically deteriorating equipment. It is an elementary Markov decision model in which an optimal policy is to replace an item when and only when its operating cost reaches a certain level Wald type identities for discounted random variables are introduced to derive a tractable method for computing these replacement levels. The analysis herein simplifies and corrects earlier work in this area.
