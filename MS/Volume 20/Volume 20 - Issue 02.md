## 1. The Political Properties of Crystalline H2O: Planning for Snow Emergencies in New York
### Author(s):
- E. S. Savas
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
A major snowstorm produced a serious snow emergency and a political crisis in New York City. Mayor Lindsay asked for an analysis of the problem to prevent its recurrence. His management science unit studied four basic questions: (1) How much snow falls on New York City? (2) How much work has to be done to clean it up? (3) What is the capacity for performing this work? (4) What improvements are needed to correct any imbalance between work load and work capacity?

## 2. Airline Seat Share: A Study in False Optimization
### Author(s):
- Seymour D. Barcun
- Peter Jeming
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
An interactive model is developed which correctly predicts the problems faced by the airline industry today. The function of the model is to simulate the decision making process of determining the number of seats (and therefore planes) a competitor will fly in a given market. (A market is a city pair, e.g., the Washington-Chicago market.) This model of competition in a regulated industry considers the interaction of seat share, market share and profitability as major determinants of policy.

## 3. Alternate Formulations for Static Multi-Attribute Assignment Models
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan
- G. L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
In an earlier issue of this journal, Charnes, Cooper, Niehaus and Stedry provided different problem formulations to take into account the multiple attributes that organizations may consider in assigning men to jobs. The present paper shows that their formulations for static multi-attribute models (i.e., when assignments are time independent) can be reformulated either as standard assignment problems or as bottleneck assignment problems by suitably redefining the cost coefficients, with the result that optimal solutions with integer assignments can be guaranteed.

## 4. The Application of an Implicit Enumeration Algorithm to the School Desegregation Problem
### Author(s):
- Robin Segerblom Liggett
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
This paper presents an implicit enumeration algorithm for redrawing school attendance boundaries in order to meet integration requirements. The basis of the approach is the division of the city into smaller areas or zones corresponding to neighborhoods. These zones are assigned to schools with the objective of minimizing the required bussing while meeting the school capacity and racial mix constraints. An entire zone is assigned to one school, thus preserving the neighborhood school concept. Viewing the possible zone-school assignments as a combinatorial problem, a general enumerative procedure is combined with probability theory to form the implicit enumeration algorithm. An explanation of the algorithm along with computational results of an application of the method to an existing school system is presented.

## 5. Nonlinear Effluent Charges
### Author(s):
- Terry A. Ferrar
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
This work derives an effluent taxation structure for meeting a specified level of regional environmental quality. It is demonstrated that the nonlinearity of the proposed charge scheme flaunts equilibrium results identical to linear user-charge programs but elicits superior dynamic characteristics. Moreover, through the use of an iterative stimulus-response algorithm we are able to minimize the technical information transfer among sectors by mapping response surfaces for polluter behavior. These continuously updated response patterns are then used to guide the system to a social optimum. Recognizing that the optimal allocation of environmental resources is likely to be a vacillating target, and that the existence of adjustment lags must be reckoned with in any operational context, we argue that meaningful policing of environmental quality will require the nonlinear taxation approach.

## 6. An Optimum Budget Allocation Model for Dynamic, Interacting Market Segments
### Author(s):
- Dennis H. Gensch
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
This paper formulates a model for determining the optimal allocation of a given advertising budget over M interacting market segments and a time domain of T periods. Guidance for budget size optimization is provided via a shadow price. The basic input parameters are in terms of sales saturation levels and advertising elasticities, concepts experienced advertising executives understand and are willing to estimate. Economic and political developments in Western Europe are increasing the interactions among geographically defined segments, and recent development in discrimination techniques may soon make market segmentation a practical strategy for the United States market.

## 7. Mail-Order Demands for Style Goods: Theory and Data Analysis
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
- Richard St.G. Sides
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
A number of alternative data-generating processes are explored for mail-order demands for seasonal style-goods. Weekly demands for 126 items over an 18-week selling season provide the empirical data. Arguments are presented which result in the following candidates for data-generating processes: (1) ratios of successive forecasts are distributed lognormally; (2) ratios of successive forecasts are distributed as t (Student); (3) actual demands during unequal time periods are distributed as negative binomial. Analysis of the data suggests the negative binomial data-generating process as both most closely representing the underlying process and being simple to adapt to a decision model. The paper concludes with an example of the use of the chosen data-generating process in a decision framework, and deals briefly with some issues of implementation.

## 8. Allocation Processes with Variable Channel Queues
### Author(s):
- Marvin Hersh
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
A dynamic model is formulated for determining optimum operating policies in a variable channel queuing situation. Such policies are required when workers must be allocated to one of several jobs which have associated with them different waiting costs. In this model, two such jobs are considered: (a) a queue job i.e., serving customers in a queue, and (b) performing another task which does not involve waiting customers (called fixed work). The criterion of the model is a minimization of the sum of these costs: the cost of customer waiting, the cost of fixed work, and the cost of changing tasks.

## 9. Stag Monotone Experimental Design Algorithm (SMEDAL)
### Author(s):
- Alexander Morgan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
In using a computer simulation to gain insight into a planning problem, repeated runs over a range of input variables can be used to develop a picture of the general response of the system being studied. SMEDAL was developed to help organize such studies and in particular to eliminate redundant computer runs. If the planning problem can be interpreted as a question of feasibility (i.e., will we win or lose?) and if the system under study exhibits a monotone property, then SMEDAL can be applied. Furthermore, SMEDAL is not limited to computer applications but can be used to save effort in any such study.

## 10. A New Algorithm for Locating Sources Among Destinations
### Author(s):
- A. M. El-Shaieb
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
The problem considered is the location of m sources among n locations (m < n) and the assignment of the location requirements to the sources in order that the total transportation cost is minimized. A branch and bound algorithm is developed to achieve an optimal solution. Two lower bounds are developed for the algorithm; one is efficient for small problems while the other is more efficient for larger problems. An illustrative example is given, and a detailed application of the algorithm to the thirty largest metropolitan centers in the United States is presented for various numbers of destination (10, 20 and 30) and sources (2, 4 and 6). The branch and bound algorithm was coded in Fortran IV and tested on a number of problems. Some of the example problems that were tested are included in this paper.

## 12. On a Class of Stochastic Optimization Problems with a Specified Growth Pattern
### Author(s):
- Masao Nakamura
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1973
### Abstract:
We consider a system which consists of several subsystems. The outputs of these subsystems satisfy linear difference equations which specify the growth pattern of the output of the system over time. The state of each subsystem is described by a finite Markov chain, the transition probabilities of which are subject to our control. Associated with the Markov chain of each subsystem is a cost per unit output of the subsystem, and the cost is incurred as the subsystem occupies one of J states in each epoch. The problem of minimizing the total expected cost with respect to the transition probabilities over a sufficiently long period of time is shown under certain conditions to reduce to a collection of n independent programs. Each of these can be solved by column generation techniques.
