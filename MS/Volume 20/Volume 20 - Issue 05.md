## 1. Preface and Guide
### Author(s):
- A. M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
My objective in assembling this issue was to garner articles that would be of clear and present interest to those who professionally develop or apply mathematical programming techniques. It was not enough for a prospective paper to be competent, original, or even a dazzling display of intellectual prowess. Rather, each paper selected had to satisfy the more difficult criterion of usefully supporting, illuminating, or advancing the current state-of-the-art of applicable mathematical programming.

## 2. Practical Solution of Large Mixed Integer Programming Problems with Umpire

### Abstract:
In this paper we discuss some branch and bound methods implemented in the UMPIRE mathematical programming system for solving practical integer programming problems and give details of computational experience with these methods. We have found that the nontrivial integer programming problems we encounter tend to fall into two classes. The first class of problems is characterized by a relatively small number (less than 100) of binary integer variables embedded in a very large and difficult linear program, with a few thousand constraints and complex matrix structure. The second class of problems tends to have many more integer variables (perhaps several hundred), frequently organized into special ordered sets and expressing complex logical relationships, but embedded in a much simpler linear program with 5001,000 constraints. Problems in the first group in particular do not generally behave well using a simple-minded penalty approach for reasons we will make clear and a number of heuristic estimation procedures are used to guide the branch and bound search. The most important devices used are priorities, the best projection criterion and pseudo-costs. Some or all of these heuristics can also be very useful in tackling the second group of problems, where it is important to reach a good solution quickly to limit the search.

## 3. An Algorithm for Large Set Partitioning Problems
### Author(s):
- Roy E. Marsten
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
An algorithm is presented for the special integer linear program known as the set partitioning problem. This problem has a binary coefficient matrix, binary variables, and unit resources. Furthermore, all of its constraints are equations. In spite of its very special form, the set partitioning problem has many practical interpretations. The algorithm is of the branch and bound type. A special class of finite mappings is enumerated rather than the customary set of binary solution vectors. Linear programming is used to obtain bounds on the minimal costs of the subproblems that arise. Computational results are reported for several large problems.

## 4. An Application of Mixed Integer Programming in the Direct Mail Industry
### Author(s):
- Rimas Kalvaitis
- Anthony G. Posgay
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
The object is to help a mailing list compilation company (M.C.R.B.) to select the most promising types of mailing lists for development and to schedule the development of the selected lists in one of the two available production facilities. A mixed integer programming model is used to perform the selection and the scheduling task. The formulation of the model places the solution technique in the general family of project selection models. The problem was solved using CDC's OPHELIE II code. The size of the program is 229 rows by 871 variables of which 65 are zero-one. As a result of the study, management substantially modified the company's product mix and reduced the level of production resources employed. There was a marked improvement in the profitability of the Company.

## 5. A Computation Study on Start Procedures, Basis Change Criteria, and Solution Algorithms for Transportation Problems
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
- D. Karney
- D. Klingman
- A. Napier
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents an in-depth computational comparison of the basic solution algorithms for solving transportation problems. The comparison is performed using state of the art computer codes for the dual simplex transportation method, the out-of-kilter method, and the primal simplex transportation method (often referred to as the Row-Column Sum Method or M O D I method). In addition, these codes are compared against a state of the art large scale LP code, O P H E L I E/LP.

## 6. NETGEN: A Program for Generating Large Scale Capacitated Assignment, Transportation, and Minimum Cost Flow Network Problems
### Author(s):
- D. Klingman
- A. Napier
- J. Stutz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to describe the development, implementation, and availability of a computer program for generating a variety of feasible network problems together with a set of benchmarked problems derived from it. The code NETGEN can generate capacitated and uncapacitated transportation and minimum cost flow network problems, and assignment problems. In addition to generating structurally different classes of network problems the code permits the user to vary structural characteristics within a class.

## 7. Multicommodity Distribution System Design by Benders Decomposition
### Author(s):
- A. M. Geoffrion
- G. W. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
A commonly occurring problem in distribution system design is the optimal location of intermediate distribution facilities between plants and customers. A multi-commodity capacitated single-period version of this problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. A solution technique based on Benders Decomposition is developed, implemented, and successfully applied to a real problem for a major food firm with 17 commodity classes, 14 plants, 45 possible distribution center sites, and 121 customer zones. An essentially optimal solution was found and proven with a surprisingly small number of Benders cuts. Some discussion is given concerning why this problem class appears to be so amenable to solution by Benders' method, and also concerning what we feel to be the proper professional use of the present computational technique.

## 8. Self-Scaling Variable Metric (SSVM) Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Shmuel S. Oren
- David G. Luenberger
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
A new criterion is introduced for comparing the convergence properties of variable metric algorithms, focusing on stepwise descent properties. This criterion is a bound on the rate of decrease in the function value at each iterative step (single-step convergence rate). Using this criterion as a basis for algorithm development leads to the introduction of variable coefficients to rescale the objective function at each iteration, and, correspondingly, to a new class of variable metric algorithms.

## 9. Self-Scaling Variable Metric (SSVM) Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Shmuel S. Oren
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
This part of the paper introduces some possible implementations of Self-Scaling Variable Metric algorithms based on the theory presented in Part I. These implementations are analyzed theoretically and discussed qualitatively. A special class of SSVM algorithms is introduced, which has the additional property of being invariant under scaling of the objective function or of the variables. Experimental results are provided for a particular case of this class. This case has been tested in comparison to the DFP algorithm on a variety of functions with up to 50 variables. The results indicate that the new method has substantial advantage for functions with a large number of variables.

## 10. Mathematical Programming Book Reviews: 19651972
### Author(s):
- Fred Gerber
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1974
### Abstract:
Approximately two hundred books on mathematical programming have been published during the past eight years. Most workers in this field have immediate access to only a minor fraction of these, but would have at least vicarious access to many of the rest through book reviews if only they knew where to look. That is the primary motivation for this bibliography of book reviews published during the years 19651972. A secondary reason is simply to furnish a reasonably comprehensive list of recent books on mathematical programming.
