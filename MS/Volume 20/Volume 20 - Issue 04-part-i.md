## 1. Management Science in the Developing Countries: A Comparative Approach to Irrigation Feasibility
### Author(s):
- J. Rose
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The paper describes an Irrigation Feasibility Study carried out for a Developing Country. The area considered comprised some 1,000,000 acres of land in Burma and the study was undertaken for the Burmese Government under the auspices of the United Nations. The solution technique used was Mixed Integer Programming, there being approximately 750 continuous variables, 50 integer variables and 250 constraints. The study is of particular interest in that the problem was solved both by conventional methods and by Operational Research methods independently. Therefore, a complete comparison of the relative merits of both approaches exists and is discussed here.

## 2. A Holistic View of Problem Solving
### Author(s):
- Edwin M. Bartee
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The limited view of the problem-solving space that is held by the world of science is criticized. A problem solution is considered to be achieved when a perceived present situation and a perceived desired situation become the same. The problem-solving space is three dimensional, and its three vectors are concerned with problem taxonomy, problem-solving modes, and problem-solving process. The space takes on greater meaning when it is related to the fourth dimension called the chronology of problem solving. This chronology includes four primary phases: personalization, collaboration, institutionalization, and socialization. A case is made that the scientific or rationalistic view of problem solving is limited in the collaboration phase and has no relevance in the institutionalization and socialization phases. A holistic view of problem solving is concerned with the relationship between the problem-solving chronology and the ultimate implementation of solutions.

## 3. The Use of Tax Incentives for Employment of Underutilized Resources
### Author(s):
- L. Southwick, Jr.
- S. Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
This paper considers the use of subsidies or tax credits for the purpose of increasing the utilization of underemployed or underutilized resources. The particular formulation studied is the subsidy which is associated with changes in the level of usage of a particular input factor. The effects on both subsidized and unsubsidized factors are considered in terms of changed demand, the market effects, and economy-wide influences.

## 4. Reduction Algorithm for Zero-One Single Knapsack Problems
### Author(s):
- Giorgio P. Ingargiola
- James F. Korsh
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
A simple algorithm is described for the reduction of 0-1 single knapsack problems to significantly smaller problems. The time required by the reduction algorithm is proportional to the number of variables. When used in conjunction with available algorithms for knapsack problems it substantially reduces total time and space requirements.

## 5. Inventory Policy and Trade Credit Financing
### Author(s):
- Charles W. Haley
- Robert C. Higgins
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
It is common business practice to purchase inventory on open account. Consequently, purchased inventory can be considered to be financed in whole or in part with trade credit. This paper investigates the relationship between inventory policy and trade credit policy in the context of the basic lot-size model. It demonstrates that, in general, optimality requires order quantity and payment time decisions determined simultaneously. The conditions under which the standard solutions are optimal are also developed.

## 6. A Model for a Multi-Item, Multi-Echelon, Multi-Indenture Inventory System
### Author(s):
- John A. Muckstadt
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to describe a mathematical model, called MOD-METRIC, for the control of a multi-item, multi-echelon, multi-indenture inventory-system for recoverable items, that is, items subject to repair when they fail. Discussion is limited to two-echelon multi-item systems in which an item may be demanded at any one of several locations called bases; in turn, these bases receive inventory from a central location called a depot. The objectives of the model are to describe the logistics relationship between an assembly and its subassemblies, and to compute spare stock levels for both echelons for the assembly and subassemblies with explicit consideration of this logistics relationship. In particular, the model is used to determine the base and depot spare stock levels which minimize total expected base backorders for the assembly subject to a system investment constraint. An example is given showing how the model can be used to calculate spare engine and engine module stock levels. MOD-METRIC has been implemented by the Air Force as the method for computing recoverable spare stock levels for the F-15 weapon system.

## 7. A Critique of The Distribution System Simulator by M. M. Connors, et al
### Author(s):
- Sumer Aggarwal
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
This paper compares DSS with other simulation models and modelling approaches of the past with respect to its weaknesses and strengths, as well as its novel and specialized characteristics. The importance of the question-and-answer superstructure of DSS is discussed. The need for regularly updating the parameters of inventory-distribution systems is noted. The serious limitations of DSS are brought into focus and reference is made to those situations which cannot be easily handled by simulation models like DSS, in general. For the benefit of the practitioners, this paper describes how and by whom DSS can be used with facility. Finally, the overall effectiveness of DSS in improving management objectives is questioned.

## 8. Determining the Optimal Investment Policy for the Tourism Sector of a Developing Country

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
For developing countries trying to increase their buying power in the community of nations, the establishment of a tourism industry is an important strategy for the generation of foreign exchange earnings. This paper develops a decision structure whereby investment allocation decisions for touristic projects may be made. The decision structure consists of a procedure to quantify the concepts of touristic attractiveness, a mathematical model representing the allocation problem, and a procedure for the solution of the model.

In astrology this is the age of Aquarius. In education this is the age of accountability and innovation. At the most general level, the principal concern of this paper is to identify those organizational, teacher and community characteristics which are associated with varying levels of student achievement growthone measure of success for a performance contract.

## 11. Analysis of the Allocation of Resources in Family Planning Programs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The reduction of population growth rates through family planning programs is being attempted in many of the developing nations of the world. This activity lends itself aptly to mathematical modelling. Building from the well-known difference equation model of population growth, a model is constructed which integrates population dynamics, program activities and resource consumption. The model may be used predictively to assess the outcome of various program activities. Alternatively, it may be used to determine the pattern of activities which yields the greatest reduction in births under the projected resource constraints. A further use of the model is the identification of the parameters to which predictions are most sensitive; such information provides valuable insights to those gathering the input data. The model is here applied to two family planning programs currently in progress. An evaluation of the feasibility of the program's goals is provided, as well as information on limiting resources, data sensitivity and the most important ages for contraceptive acceptance. The model's generality is such that it can be applied to most birth control programs which are planned at the national or regional level.

## 12. NoteA Model for Minimizing the Cost of Drilling Dual Completion Oil Wells
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Devine
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
When developing offshore oil fields most wells are dual completions; i.e., two oil traps (targets) are produced together through a single hole. This problem is discussed and a model is developed for finding the pairing of targets in order to minimize the total drilling cost. The mathematical formulation of this problem turns out to be the well known symmetric assignment problem (or matching problem). Algorithms for the solution of these problems are discussed and computational results are presented.
