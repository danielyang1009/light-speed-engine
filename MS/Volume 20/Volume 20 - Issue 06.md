## 1. Simulation Testing of Aggregate Production Planning Models in an Implementation Methodology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
The planning of production, inventories, and work force at an aggregate level to respond to fluctuating demands on a production system has received substantial theoretical treatment in the literature for several years. However, widespread implementation of the available analytical techniques has not occurred. The objectives of this research are to explore this implementation problem: (1) by developing a simulation model of an operating firm, (2) by using this simulation to compare the performance of aggregate production planning models, and (3) by formulating a generalized methodology for implementing quantitative planning models into the decision procedures of operating firms.

## 2. Decisions on Social and Technological Tasks Incorporating Expression of Preference and Environmental Insult
### Author(s):
- J. E. Dooley
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
A task of a social or technological nature is to be undertaken. There are n methods that can be used singly or in combination to accomplish the task. Several insults to the social and aesthetic factors expressing quality of life occur as a result of the task. The problem is to obtain a measure of importance for the factors and then use this to evaluate the alternatives. The paper attempts to integrate a number of components of this problem that have been dealt with extensively in the literature, in a way that provides information for the decision maker. A case study is reported and several problems needing further research are discussed.

## 3. A Consumer-Based Methodology for the Identification of New Product Ideas
### Author(s):
- Allan D. Shocker
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
This paper suggests a procedure which analytically ties a model to predict users' predispositions to purchase different brands in a product-market together with a search process to identify optimal new product ideas. Brands, conceptualized as attribute bundles, are located in a prespecified attribute space. The painwise preference judgments of each individual in a representative sample drawn from the population of users are analyzed using the authors' LINMAP procedure (LINear programming techniques for Multidimensional Analysis of Preferences) to determine his ideal point and salience weights for the attributes of the space. A distance model of choice is postulated for each user and used to predict his probability of choosing nonexisting products. The models developed for each user are tied to methods for searching the product space to find best locations for new products. The proposed procedures are discussed and evaluated in the light of relevant conceptual and empirical research. The paper concludes with a discussion of additional applications of the behavioral framework of LINMAP to other marketing decision areas.

## 4. An Econometric Analysis of Advertising, Retail Availability, and Sales of a New Brand
### Author(s):
- Leonard J. Parsons
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
This article is an exploratory study on the question: Does consumer advertising increase retail availability of a new product? Nerlove's procedure is used to estimate a dynamic model. Cross-section and time series data for one product class are pooled. The managerial implications of the model are discussed.

## 5. A Mathematical Model for Price Promotions
### Author(s):
- Yoram Kinberg
- Ambar G. Rao
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
A market where two groups of brands, premium (higher priced) and private label (lower priced) are sold is considered. It is assumed price is the only indicator of quality. Using hypotheses about consumer behavior in such markets, a model for changes in market share that would result from temporary price reductions by one of the premium brands is constructed. The model is used to develop promotional strategies for one of the premium brands, given various assumptions about competitive behavior. Methods for use of the model are suggested.

## 6. A Model of Wage Bargaining Involving Negotiations and Sanctions
### Author(s):
- Raphael Trifon
- Moshe Landau
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model of wage bargaining between an employer and a labour union (or alternatively of collective bargaining). The bargaining is conducted by comparing a claim and an offer at fixed time intervals. These are generated by the respective parties from reaction functions that allow for past submissions and anticipation of future positions. The reaction functions themselves change from one step to the next, and have to be worked out in a sequence. Consequently, the outcome of the process cannot be guessed at the outset. It is assumed throughout that labour slows down production as a sanction, with a total strike as an extreme possibility. Labour may or may not suffer wage losses proportional to the severity of its sanction. Finally, a bluffing strategy is introduced for both parties. The model can serve as a basis for numerical simulation of wage conflicts, and sensitivity tests of behavioural parameters.

## 7. A Diet Model with Protein Quality Variable
### Author(s):
- Victor E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
Malnutrition is a serious obstacle to development in many countries. To deal with it effectively we must know how to provide adequate nutrition in an economical way. Linear programming will determine the most economical set of foods or production activities if the set of nutrients needed can be specified in absolute amounts or as fixed ratios, but this will not suffice for one of the most pressing nutritional problemsthe protein problem. It is impossible to specify the quantity of protein required in this way. That quantity depends upon the concentration of protein in the diet and the quality of the protein (its amino acid composition). The greater the concentration, the less efficiently the protein is used; the better the quality, the more efficiently. For a least-cost diet, quality and quantity must be determined simultaneously, but the relationships are nonlinear. This paper presents a model, with one nonlinear restraint, that determines a least-cost diet in which the quality and the quantity of the protein are jointly and optimally determined.

## 9. A Horizon-Varying, Zero-One Approach to Project Scheduling
### Author(s):
- James H. Patterson
- Walter D. Huber
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
Bounding techniques similar to those used with branch and bound procedures are used in this study in conjunction with zero-one programming to produce minimum duration schedules for the resource constrained, project scheduling problem. The algorithms developed consist of examining the feasibility of a series of zero-one programming problems rather than solving one zero-one problem optimally. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of this method over using zero-one programming without employing any form of bounding. A comparison with other exact procedures for solving the resource constrained, project scheduling problem is also given.

## 10. The OPRAD Research and Development Management Game
### Author(s):
- Klaus Truemper
- Burton V. Dean
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
The OPRAD game was developed as an educational and research tool in R&D management. The game is an extension of a previously developed OPSIM management game (Darden and Lucas, [Darden, W. R., W. H. Lucas. 1969. The Decision Making Game: An Integrated Operations Research Management Simulation. Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York.]) to include R&D personnel and project decisions. A methodology of game evaluation includes both player performance and results of a written questionnaire. Utilizing data on player performance in a model of the learning process yields results which correspond to conclusions obtained from the questionnaire, providing justification for the approach taken. These results indicate that the game is useful in the training of both R&D managers and management scientists.

## 11. Assembly Line Balancing with Multiple Stations
### Author(s):
- G. M. Buxey
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1974
### Abstract:
A case is stated for extending the techniques of assembly line balancing to provide for the parallel operation of identical stations, where this leads to a reduction in idle time. The practical implications of operating with this type of system are discussed, both for the stations themselves and the line as a whole, with reference to various classifications of assembly line, and ways in which balancing can be made to fit into an overall strategy for production line design are touched upon. Two distinct types of computer program have been developed to enable multiple stations to become a recognised feature incorporated into heuristic line balancing, rather than an appendage to be applied ad hoc by industrial engineers when current techniques have proven inadequate. One approach is based on a more sophisticated version of the positional weight method while the other relies on the contrasting philosophy of the random generation method, and a comparison is made of their relative success in solving two assembly line problems, and their potential from an industrial viewpoint.
