## 1. Descriptive Aspects of Team Theory: Observation, Communication and Decision Heuristics in Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. MacCrimmon
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
To examine the descriptive validity of the economic theory of teams and, more particularly, to study observation, communication, and decision behaviors, sixty business and government executives were asked to make recommendations for the optimal design of a hypothetical sugar plantation information system. Few of the subjects made mathematical calculations; instead they used observation, communication, and decision heuristics which seem representative of behavior occurring in real situations. Ten percent recommended the optimal team theory solution while the remainder exhibited inefficient and sometimes mutually inconsistent heuristics. In some cases too little information was collected and distributed: (1) information expected at particular communication or decision centers was not available at that center, and (2) information observed or communicated was not extensive enough to yield maximum expected net profits. In other cases too much information was collected and distributed: (1) the information, when used, did not yield big enough improvements to cover its cost, (2) the information, when used, resulted in a lower expected gross profit due to interdependencies, and (3) the information observed or communicated was never used. Implications of the results for both theory and practice are discussed.

## 2. An Experimental Evaluation of Information Overload in a Production Environment
### Author(s):

- Gary W. Dickson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of an experimental study of the relationship between the effectiveness of aggregate production planning decisions and the form of the information system used to support the decision making. The experiment, involving twenty two graduate business administration students devoting an entire week end to the decision making activity in a simulated, computer based environment, generated results showing significantly different performance according to the form in which information was presented. Decision makers given data summarized through the use of simple descriptive statistics (1) made higher quality decisions than those receiving the same data in standard formats, (2) had less confidence in the quality of their decisions, and (3) took longer to make their decisions.

## 3. A Weather Model for Simulating Offshore Construction Alternatives
### Author(s):
- M. H. Rothkopf

- S. Fromovitz
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
The time and cost required for offshore construction operations are often dominated by the influence of weather, particularly wave heights. Historical wave height data can be summarized in a simple probabilistic model that can be used in a Monte Carlo simulation of the construction operations. Such a simulation has been used effectively to evaluate alternative bids on pipeline projects in the Gulf of Mexico. This paper describes the Markovian wave height model we have incorporated in the simulation.

## 4. A Transshipment Model for Cash Management Decisions
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
The cash management problem is concerned with optimally financing net cash outflows and investing net inflows of a firm while simultaneously determining payment schedules for incurred liabilities. The problem is formulated as a transshipment model to minimize the total cost of allocating sources of funds to different uses while retaining the possibility of transferring cash between sources. A numerical example is formulated using this model and its optimal solution is shown to be essentially the same as that of a linear programming formulation proposed by Orgler. Extensions of the methodology for examining the effects of different minimum cash balance requirements and for incorporating other institutional constraints are also outlined. The transshipment formulation is useful in organizing data for financial control. It is intuitively appealing and computationally more efficient (by a factor of about 30 to 1) than the linear programming formulation of the problem.

## 5. A Normative Model for Negotiations
### Author(s):
- Ambar G. Rao
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
Negotiations between a multinational corporation and a host government are considered for an international joint venture. Various negotiating behavior concepts that the two parties may use are discussed. The process of concession-making is formulated as a sequential decision problem, where each party has an opportunity for concession-making in alternating negotiation sessions, the magnitude of the concession depending on the current state of negotiations and the behavior concept being employed. A dynamic programming model is developed to yield normative recommendations as to concession-making. Numerical examples illustrating the model are presented.

## 6. An Integer Programming Algorithm for Portfolio Selection
### Author(s):
- Bruce Faaland
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
A mean-variance portfolio selection model suitable for the small investor is formulated as a sequence of quadratic integer programming problems. The special structure of these quadratic problems is exploited in a partial enumeration algorithm which uses cutting planes to accelerate convergence. Computational experience is reported on problems ranging in size from fifteen to fifty variables.

## 7. A Technique for Designing and Augmenting Simulation Experiments
### Author(s):
- Donald R. Williams
- David L. Weeks
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
The technique presented permits the experimenter to eliminate, if possible, a large number of the design points of an experiment. It also permits him to sequentially converge, if necessary, to an entire set of design points or to eliminate design points in which there is little interest. The technique is very flexible with regard to augmentation of levels and/or factors at various stages of the investigation. Thus, it provides a means of designing and augmenting experiments which is particularly suitable to simulation experiments. Furthermore, the analysis of the data at each step in the sequence is performed using the conventional analysis-of-variance techniques.

## 8. Multi-Attribute Utility Models: A Review of Field and Field-Like Studies
### Author(s):
- George P. Huber
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
This article contains a review of published field and field-like research studies concerned with the development and use of multi-attribute utility models. Since the clients or experimental subjects who participated in these studies were all occupationally experienced in making the utility judgments required of them, it is felt that these particular findings would be useful in the practice of management science. Multi-attribute utility models are models designed to obtain the utility of items or alternatives that must be evaluated on more than one criterion. The additive and multiplicative model forms are examined, and methods for estimating the model parameters are presented.

## 9. Surveillance Schedules for Medical Examinations
### Author(s):

- M. Klein
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1974
### Abstract:
A model is developed to aid in determining examination schedules for the detection of an age-dependent disease. It is shown that in an optimal schedule the interval between examinations is proportional to the square root of the age-specific incidence probability of the disease. To illustrate the methodology, optimal schedules are developed for breast cancer examinations.
