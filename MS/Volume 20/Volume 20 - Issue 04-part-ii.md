## 1. Commentary on the Canadian Issue of Management Science
### Author(s):
- Martin K. Starr
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
Management Science in Canada is an exciting publication. It is the first issue of MANAGEMENT SCIENCE that is specifically dedicated to the activities of practitioners of a particular country or region of the world. As such, it can serve as a model. This model must be adapted to reflect the characteristics of Management Science, as its practice has evolved in other nations, groups of nations, industries, institutions, etc.

- David W. Conrath
- C. T. L. Janssen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
Management Science is not unique to any particular country or set of countries. It is comprised of processes, techniques and tools that are potentially applicable to problems found in a wide range of social and economic systems. The scope and style of management science practices vary from country to country. In Canada the community of Operational Research/Management Science (OR/MS) practitioners has grown to approximately 1200, according to the membership lists of professional societies. The time has come to take stock. It is with this goal in mind that we accepted the challenge of editing and contributing to Management Science in Canada.

## 3. On Bridging the Gaps
### Author(s):
- D. J. Daly
- Rein Peterson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper the authors present an interpretive discussion of the scope for management scientists to make a more effective contribution to improving the performance of the Canadian economy, by active involvement in management and decision making in Canadian institutions, both private and public. Initially the paper surveys the evidence on the differences in economic performance between Canada and the United States, outlining the methods used, and the results. Some factors turn out to be relatively unimportant in the differences, while others are quite crucial. In the broad area of manufacturing, the gap in economic performance is particularly wide. Tariffs in Canada and other countries have become important contributions to the existing product diversity, short production runs, high cost and low productivity in relation to performance in other countries. A further important area is the pattern of decision making in Canada which has led to a survival strategy and resistance to change rather than innovation, creativity and risk taking. This tends to perpetuate the lower levels of productivity found to exist.

## 4. Comment: Corporate Planning that Works
### Author(s):
- Donald B. McCaskill
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
In short, management science models must deal with significant unstructured problems or supplement existing decision processes within an organization, to be of any use. To contribute to the improvement of corporate planning in Canada, management scientists must learn how to generate commitment to their models among management. They must achieve such commitment gradually, for it is impossible to take an operating manager out of the main stream, protect him from his peers and then get him to change his personalized way of taking action. Based on my experience management scientists, for the most part, have not had the patience to create commitment to their methods.

## 5. Comment: Computer-Based Decision Systems and Canadian Management
### Author(s):
- Andrew A. Grindlay
- Gordon Cummer
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
We interviewed 65 senior executives in 42 organizations and asked them about their use of computers in decision making and found that: 1. In the 42 organizations studied, none had a functioning, fully integrated Corporate Decision-Information System. 2. With the exception of budget preparation, little use is being made of the computer for strategic planning purposes in Canada. 3. The computer appears to be used mostly to help lower and middle levels of management but has not found much use in the mahogany-panelled offices in the executive suite.

## 7. Communications Environment and its Relationship to Organizational Structure
### Author(s):
- David W. Conrath
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the relationships between modes of communication, the communication environment and organizational structure. This is a very neglected area of organizational analysis, which is surprising considering the possible implications of such relationships. A framework is presented within which the above relationships can be identified and studied.

## 8. Estimation of Rural Demand for Natural Gas
### Author(s):
- S. M. Tinic
- B. M. Harnden
- C. T. L. Janssen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The Government of Alberta has undertaken a study to determine the feasibility of supplying natural gas to rural areas of the Province not currently served. The study covers various aspects relevant to the development of an overall plan for rural gasification, but the emphasis is on major factors affecting the economic viability of the venture. We discuss in this paper one segment of the studythe problem of determining the demand for natural gas in rural areas. Three separate demand schedules, each based on a different methodology but using common data obtained from a survey of rural residents, are estimated. The three demand schedules are analysed and compared in an attempt to establish an overall demand curve for natural gas in rural Alberta. The price elasticity of demand for natural gas is determined from the demand function obtained.

## 9. Forest Fire Detection Systems Design
### Author(s):

- Gregory A. Martin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
Empirical data would suggest that forestry managers have been hesitant in their adoption of a management sciences approach to their problems of prevention, detection and suppression of forest fires. A joint program of research has been undertaken between the Alberta Forest Service and the Faculty of Business Administration and Commerce at the University of Alberta in an attempt to develop, test and evaluate state-of-the-art management science approaches to the problems of forest management. This paper outlines the program of research being undertaken and describes a simulation model which has been developed as part of the research program. The model, which can be readily adapted for analysis of any forest, has been used to examine various fire detection strategies for the Footner Forest in Northern Alberta. The results from this examination are presented along with the results from the goodness-of-fit tests used to validate the model. The model is presently being used and evaluated by forestry personnel.

## 10. Simulation, Synthesis and Urban Public Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- Michael A. Goldberg
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The 1960's saw the introduction of simulation techniques into the area of urban and regional planning. The present paper describes a large-scale urban simulation effort currently underway in Vancouver, British Columbia. The project differs from similar work in a number of ways. Most notably, the current effort stresses the process of model-building, including the widespread public use and discussion of the work and its limitations.

## 11. Financing Public Hospitals in Ontario: A Case Study in Rationing of Capital Budgets
### Author(s):
- H. W. Jackman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
A real system is described where the normal assumptions of capital rationing are violated. A goal programming model of this system is developed which allows a decision maker to choose the basis upon which an objective could be computed. The major part of this model is an integer programming algorithm leading to selection of the projects which optimize the system according to the basis chosen yet can be used on a relatively small computer. Finally, speculation on the possible use of this tool in other public sector decision making activities is presented.

## 12. A Dynamic Programming Model for the Expansion of Electric Power Systems
### Author(s):
- E. R. Petersen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
This paper describes a dynamic programming model that has been developed to determine an optimal expansion plan for the generating capacity of an electric power system. The optimization model determines the least-cost mix of capacity between hydro, nuclear, thermal and peaking turbine plants, the size of the plants to add to the system, and the timing of these additions. We show how the computational requirements of this four-state-variable, four-decision-variable problem can be substantially reduced, resulting in a computationally feasible model. The techniques developed are applicable to a large class of capital budgeting problems under uncertainty. Reference is also made to the actual application of the model and an example is presented.

## 13. The Pit Charging Problem in Steel Production
### Author(s):
- J. A. Buzacott
- J. R. Callahan
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
In most integrated works, ingots are used as an intermediate form during the production of steel. These ingots, produced by pouring molten steel into molds, are too large to be used as input for the finishing mills which produce steel products. Hence, more manageable forms (blooms, billets and slabs) are rolled from the ingots by primary mills.

## 14. A Planning Model for a Water Quality Management Agency
### Author(s):
- Anthony C. Taylor
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
The Canada Water Act provides for the establishment of regional management agencies in areas designated as water quality management areas. These agencies must establish water quality standards within their area and design a control program to meet these standards efficiently. This paper describes a model for planning an efficient water quality program within a river basin. The waste abatement control employed is called the rent allotment control, whose merit is that its implementation provides a solution to the information problem of efficient waste abatement. The control is implemented through a bargaining process or game between the agency and the waste dischargers that may be characterized as an n-person prisoner's dilemma. The game provides the agency with information about individual waste abatement costs, and terminates in a set of agreements on rents and allotments which depend upon the bidding strategies adopted by each player. Optimal bidding strategies are examined under the assumption that waste dischargers are risk averse and cost minimizing. An example of the operation of the control is provided using data from the Ottawa River Basin.

### Author(s):
- C. Swoveland
- D. Uyeno
- I. Vertinsky
- R. Vickson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper a probabilistic branch and bound procedure is developed for the ambulance location problem. Information on system characteristics under various ambulance assignments and dispatch rules was provided by a digital simulation. The output of the simulation was also used to construct the objective function for the optimal location problem. The procedure was used to determine ambulance locations in Vancouver, Canada. Solutions obtained from the branch and bound procedure were verified by simulation runs.

## 17. Sure Staf: A Computerized Staff Scheduling System for Telephone Business Offices
### Author(s):
- J. G. Church
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1973
### Abstract:
Scheduling of staff between answering incoming calls and processing paper-work has been a continual problem in telephone company Business Offices. A staff scheduling system has been developed and implemented in Bell Canada on a trial basis. Incoming call load data are recorded automatically and are entered daily into a time share computer terminal. The next day's forecast, by half hour, is made by a cyclic exponential smoothing routine and the number of servers required to take calls is calculated using a queueing model of the Business Office. A schedule of call answering periods for the available staff to match the requirements is made using a heuristic algorithm. Managers are able to choose their objective on the accessibility of the office to incoming customer calls and the staff can organize their work day without unplanned interruptions.
