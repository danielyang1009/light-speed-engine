### Abstract:
To aid in understanding how best to respond to a bioterror anthrax attack, we analyze a system of differential equations that includes an atmospheric release model, a spatial array of biosensors, a dose-response model, a disease progression model, and a set of spatially distributed tandem queues for distributing antibiotics and providing hospital care. We derive approximate closed-form expressions for the number of deaths as a function of key parameters and management levers, including the size of the attack, the time at which the attack is detected via symptomatic patients, the number of days to distribute antibiotics, the efficacy (both for treatment and prevention) of antibiotics, the prophylactic antibiotic distribution strategy, the prioritization of the antibiotics queue, and the detection limit, deployment density, and delay time of biosensors.

## 2. Association Between Supply Chain Glitches and Operating Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
This paper empirically documents the association between supply chain glitches and operating performance. The results are based on a sample of 885 glitches announced by publicly traded firms. Changes in various operating performance metrics for the sample firms are compared against a sample of control firms of similar size and from similar industries. In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are −107%, −114%, and −92%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are −13.78% and −2.32%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92% lower sales growth, 10.66% higher growth in cost, and 13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to—glitches are associated with negative operating performance across the board.

## 3. Generating Volatility Forecasts from Value at Risk Estimates
### Author(s):
- James W. Taylor
### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
Statistical volatility models rely on the assumption that the shape of the conditional distribution is fixed over time and that it is only the volatility that varies. The recently proposed conditional autoregressive value at risk (CAViaR) models require no such assumption, and allow quantiles to be modeled directly in an autoregressive framework. Although useful for risk management, CAViaR models do not provide volatility forecasts. Such forecasts are needed for several other important applications, such as option pricing and portfolio management. It has been found that, for a variety of probability distributions, there is a surprising constancy of the ratio of the standard deviation to the interval between symmetric quantiles in the tails of the distribution, such as the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles. This result has been used in decision and risk analysis to provide an approximation of the standard deviation in terms of quantile estimates provided by experts. Drawing on the same result, we construct financial volatility forecasts as simple functions of the interval between CAViaR forecasts of symmetric quantiles. Forecast comparison, using five stock indices and 20 individual stocks, shows that the method is able to outperform generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and moving average methods.

## 4. Market for Software Vulnerabilities? Think Again
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
Software vulnerability disclosure has become a critical area of concern for policymakers. Traditionally, a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) acts as an infomediary between benign identifiers (who voluntarily report vulnerability information) and software users. After verifying a reported vulnerability, CERT sends out a public advisory so that users can safeguard their systems against potential exploits. Lately, firms such as iDefense have been implementing a new market-based approach for vulnerability information. The market-based infomediary provides monetary rewards to identifiers for each vulnerability reported. The infomediary then shares this information with its client base. Using this information, clients protect themselves against potential attacks that exploit those specific vulnerabilities.

## 5. A Longitudinal Model of Continued IS Use: An Integrative View of Four Mechanisms Underlying Postadoption Phenomena
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
Although initial use is an important indicator of information system (IS) success, it does not necessarily lead to the desired managerial outcome unless the use continues. However, compared with the great amount of work done on IS adoption, little systematic effort has gone into providing insight into continued IS use over time. The objective of this study is to develop a longitudinal model of how users’ evaluations and behavior evolve as they gain experience with the information technology application. The proposed model is a unified framework that sheds light on four different mechanisms underlying postadoption phenomena: (1) the processes suggested by the technology acceptance model; (2) sequential updating mechanisms; (3) feedback mechanisms; and (4) repeated behavioral patterns. The proposed model was empirically tested in the context of Web-based IS use in a nonexperimental setting. Our findings suggest that, as hypothesized, each of the four theoretical viewpoints is essential for a deeper understanding of continued IS use. We discuss important findings that emerged from this longitudinal study and suggest directions for additional research.

## 6. Collaborative Networks as Determinants of Knowledge Diffusion Patterns
### Author(s):
- Jasjit Singh
### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether interpersonal networks help explain two widely documented patterns of knowledge diffusion: (1) geographic localization of knowledge flows, and (2) concentration of knowledge flows within firm boundaries. I measure knowledge flows using patent citation data, and employ a novel regression framework based on choice-based sampling to estimate the probability of knowledge flow between inventors of any two patents. As expected, intraregional and intrafirm knowledge flows are found to be stronger than those across regional or firm boundaries. I explore whether these patterns can be explained by direct and indirect network ties among inventors, as inferred from past collaborations among them. The existence of a tie is found to be associated with a greater probability of knowledge flow, with the probability decreasing as the path length (geodesic) increases. Furthermore, the effect of regional or firm boundaries on knowledge flow decreases once interpersonal ties have been accounted for. In fact, being in the same region or firm is found to have little additional effect on the probability of knowledge flow among inventors who already have close network ties. The overall evidence is consistent with a view that interpersonal networks are important in determining observed patterns of knowledge diffusion.

## 7. Evolution of R&D Capabilities: The Role of Knowledge Networks Within a Firm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper, we suggest that the characteristics of individual positions in an intraorganizational network of inventors or intrafirm knowledge network predict the likelihood with which knowledge created by an inventor is used in the firm’s research and development (R&D) activities. Such choices lead to path dependence and subsequent specialization. We provide empirical evidence that a firm’s R&D is concentrated in those areas where it chooses to recombine knowledge, offering support for the path-dependent evolution of capabilities. We test this theory by analyzing the R&D networks in DuPont, a highly regarded Fortune 500 chemical company. Cox Proportional Regression models of intrafirm citations on network characteristics offer strong empirical support for our theory.

## 8. Conservative Accounting Choices
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
Managers have sufficient discretion under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to adopt more or less conservative financial reporting policies. In this paper, we develop a signaling model to provide insight into managers’ decisions to be conservative in their accounting. We provide conditions under which the market can use the manager’s exercise of discretion to infer her private information about the future prospects of the firm and thus firm value. Under these conditions, we also show that there are meaningful differences between earnings response coefficients for firms whose managers choose a conservative reporting policy and those whose managers do not. Finally, we use our theoretical model to provide intuition for some established empirical results on earnings response coefficients.

## 9. On the Timing of CEO Stock Option Awards
### Author(s):
- Erik Lie
### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
This study documents that the abnormal stock returns are negative before unscheduled executive option awards and positive afterward. The return pattern has intensified over time, suggesting that executives have gradually become more effective at timing awards to their advantage, and possibly explaining why the results in this study differ from those in past studies. Moreover, I document that the predicted returns are abnormally low before the awards and abnormally high afterward. Unless executives possess an extraordinary ability to forecast the future marketwide movements that drive these predicted returns, the results suggest that at least some of the awards are timed retroactively.

## 10. Revenue Management Games: Horizontal and Vertical Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2005
### Abstract:
A well-studied problem in the literature on airline revenue (or yield) management is the optimal allocation of seat inventory among fare classes, given a demand distribution for each class. In practice, the seat allocation decisions of one airline affect the passenger demands for seats on other airlines. In this paper, we examine the seat inventory control problem under both horizontal competition (two airlines compete for passengers on the same flight leg) and vertical competition (different airlines fly different legs on a multileg itinerary). Such vertical competition can be the outcome of a code-sharing agreement between airlines, because each airline sells seats on the partner airlines’ flights but the airlines are unwilling, or unable, to coordinate yield management decisions. We provide a general sufficient condition under which a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists in these revenue management games, and we also compare the total number of seats available in each fare class with, and without, competition. Analytical results as well as numerical examples demonstrate that more seats are protected for higher-fare passengers under horizontal competition than when a single airline acts as a monopoly. Under vertical competition the booking limit may be higher or lower, however, than the monopoly level, depending on the demand for connecting flights in each fare class. Finally, we discuss revenue-sharing contracts that coordinate the actions of both airlines.

## 11. Beyond the Endogeneity Bias: The Effect of Unmeasured Brand Characteristics on Household-Level Brand Choice Models
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We investigate the role of potential weekly brand-specific characteristics that influence consumer choices, but are unobserved or unmeasurable by the researcher. We use an empirical approach, based on the estimation methods used for standard random coefficients logit models, to account for the presence of such unobserved attributes. Using household scanner panel data, we find evidence that ignoring such time-varying latent (to the researcher) characteristics can lead to two types of problems. First, consistent with previous literature, we find that these unobserved characteristics may lead to biased estimates of the mean price response parameters. This argument is based on a form of price endogeneity. If marketing managers set prices based on consumer willingness to pay, then the observed prices will likely be correlated with the latent (to the researcher) brand characteristics. We resolve this problem by using an instrumental variables procedure. Our findings suggest that simply ignoring these attributes may also lead to larger estimates of the variance in the heterogeneity distribution of preferences and price sensitivities across households. This could overstate the benefits from marketing activities such as household-level targeting. We resolve the problem by using weekly brand intercepts, embedded in a random coefficients brand choice model, to control for weekly brand-specific characteristics, while accounting for household heterogeneity. Overall, our results extend the finding on the endogeneity bias from the mean of the heterogeneity distribution (i.e., the price effect) to include the variance of that distribution.
