## 1. Your Money or Your Life: A Prescriptive Model for Health, Safety, and Consumption Decisions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a conceptual framework and model for valuing risks to an individual’s health and life and to support decision making about investments in health, quality of life, and safety. Our treatment of health risks in the model builds on the popular quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) framework that balances health quality and length of life issues. We extend this framework to consider financial concerns as well as health quality and length of life. Our model considers uncertainty in income and health and incorporates the decision maker’s ability to adjust consumption over time in response to changes in expectations about health and income. We use this model to study the optimal tradeoffs between financial gains or losses and improvements or reductions in health or longevity and apply it in two example medical decision problems.

## 2. Four Score and Seven Years from Now: The Date/Delay Effect in Temporal Discounting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
We describe a new anomaly in intertemporal choice—the “date/delay effect”: discount rates that are imputed when time is described using calendar dates (e.g., on October 17) are markedly lower than those revealed when future outcomes are described in terms of the corresponding delay (e.g., in six months). Date descriptions not only reduce discount rates, but also affect the implied shape of the discount function: When inferred from intertemporal choices between options referenced by calendar dates, the discount function appears markedly less hyperbolic. We discuss potential psychological bases of the date/delay effect, its implications, and other modes of temporal reference.

## 3. Risky Choices and Correlated Background Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
The analysis of a risky project should take into account not only uncertainties about the return from that project (“project risk”), but also uncertainties associated with other ongoing projects and with exogenous factors that can impact final wealth (“background risk”). The presence of background risk can change the optimal course of action with respect to a project, and ignoring such risk might lead to a poor decision. Most work on background risk assumes that project risk and background risk are independent and are additive in their impact on wealth. However, independence is often unrealistic, and background risk operates in a multiplicative manner in many situations. We relax the independence assumption and consider a model with both additive and multiplicative background risk. The optimal decisions in the correlated setting can be very different than those that would appear optimal if the correlation were ignored. The impact of correlation differs in the additive and multiplicative cases, with positive correlation being beneficial in some cases and negative correlation in others. The analytical and numerical results indicate that in analyzing decision-making problems, it is very important to understand the direction and degree of dependence between project risk and background risks.

## 4. Three New Tests of Independence That Differentiate Models of Risky Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Birnbaum
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
This paper tests new “independence” properties to compare three models of risky decision making. According to the rank-affected multiplicative (RAM) weights model, all three properties should be satisfied; according to the transfer of attention exchange (TAX) model, two should be satisfied and one can be violated. However, according to cumulative prospect theory (CPT), all three properties will be violated if the probability weighting function is nonlinear. Although CPT is flexible enough to accommodate violations of these properties, its predicted violations based on previously estimated parameters failed to materialize. In 14 choices for which the CPT model disagreed with TAX, CPT correctly predicted the modal choice in only one case and TAX predicted the modal choice in the other 13. New versions of three other paradoxes were also tested and found to refute CPT.

## 5. Eliciting Informative Feedback: The Peer-Prediction Method
### Author(s):
- Nolan Miller
- Paul Resnick

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
Many recommendation and decision processes depend on eliciting evaluations of opportunities, products, and vendors. A scoring system is devised that induces honest reporting of feedback. Each rater merely reports a signal, and the system applies proper scoring rules to the implied posterior beliefs about another rater’s report. Honest reporting proves to be a Nash equilibrium. The scoring schemes can be scaled to induce appropriate effort by raters and can be extended to handle sequential interaction and continuous signals. We also address a number of practical implementation issues that arise in settings such as academic reviewing and online recommender and reputation systems.

## 6. Preferences, Identity, and Competition: Predicting Tie Strength from Demographic Data
### Author(s):
- Ray Reagans
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
This research examines the combined influence of three causal mechanisms shaping interpersonal dynamics. Sharing a demographic characteristic has been shown to strengthen a relationship between people. The initial explanation for this positive effect emphasized the importance of individual preferences for social contact. Similar people share common interests, which makes them more attractive as exchange partners. More recent explanations have highlighted the important role of identification and competition. Identification increases the tendency for strong ties to develop among similar people, while competition reduces that tendency. I argue that tie strength is a function of all three mechanisms: a baseline level of interpersonal attraction, a positive identification effect, and a negative competition adjustment. Identification and competition vary with the number of people sharing the focal attribute to define a predictable association between sharing the focal attribute and the strength of a network connection. Predictions are tested with tenure and tie-strength data from a small research and development firm. Analysis indicates that having the same tenure has the predicted effect on communication frequency. The implications of the findings are discussed for homophily research in particular and demography research in general.

## 7. Choice-Based Elicitation and Decomposition of Decision Weights for Gains and Losses Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of an experimental parameter-free elicitation and decomposition of decision weights under uncertainty. Assuming cumulative prospect theory, utility functions were elicited for gains and losses at an individual level using the tradeoff method. Subsequently, decision weights were elicited through certainty equivalents of uncertain two-outcome prospects. Furthermore, decision weights were decomposed using observable choice instead of invoking other empirical primitives, as in previous experimental studies. The choice-based elicitation of decision weights allows for a quantitative study of their characteristics, and also allows, among other things, for the examination of the sign-dependence hypothesis for observed choice under uncertainty. Our results confirm concavity of the utility function in the gain domain and bounded subadditivity of decision weights and choice-based subjective probabilities. We also find evidence for sign dependence of decision weights.

## 8. A Partially Observed Markov Decision Process for Dynamic Pricing
### Author(s):
- Yossi Aviv
- Amit Pazgal
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a stylized partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to study a dynamic pricing problem faced by sellers of fashion-like goods. We consider a retailer that plans to sell a given stock of items during a finite sales season. The objective of the retailer is to dynamically price the product in a way that maximizes expected revenues. Our model brings together various types of uncertainties about the demand, some of which are resolvable through sales observations. We develop a rigorous upper bound for the seller’s optimal dynamic decision problem and use it to propose an active-learning heuristic pricing policy. We conduct a numerical study to test the performance of four different heuristic dynamic pricing policies in order to gain insight into several important managerial questions that arise in the context of revenue management.

## 9. Subjective Probability Assessment in Decision Analysis: Partition Dependence and Bias Toward the Ignorance Prior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
Decision and risk analysts have considerable discretion in designing procedures for eliciting subjective probabilities. One of the most popular approaches is to specify a particular set of exclusive and exhaustive events for which the assessor provides such judgments. We show that assessed probabilities are systematically biased toward a uniform distribution over all events into which the relevant state space happens to be partitioned, so that probabilities are “partition dependent.” We surmise that a typical assessor begins with an “ignorance prior” distribution that assigns equal probabilities to all specified events, then adjusts those probabilities insufficiently to reflect his or her beliefs concerning how the likelihoods of the events differ. In five studies, we demonstrate partition dependence for both discrete events and continuous variables (Studies 1 and 2), show that the bias decreases with increased domain knowledge (Studies 3 and 4), and that top experts in decision analysis are susceptible to this bias (Study 5). We relate our work to previous research on the “pruning bias” in fault-tree assessment (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1978) and show that previous explanations of pruning bias (enhanced availability of events that are explicitly specified, ambiguity in interpreting event categories, and demand effects) cannot fully account for partition dependence. We conclude by discussing implications for decision analysis practice.

## 10. An Approach to the Measurement, Analysis, and Prediction of Brand Equity and Its Sources
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan
- Chan Su Park
- Dae Ryun Chang
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2005
### Abstract:
The authors propose a new approach for measuring, analyzing, and predicting a brand’s equity in a product market. Brand equity is defined as the incremental contribution ($) per year obtained by the brand in comparison to the underlying product (or service) with no brand-building efforts. The incremental contribution is driven by the individual customer’s incremental choice probability for the brand in comparison to his choice probability for the underlying product with no brand-building efforts. The approach takes into account three sources of brand equity—brand awareness, attribute perception biases, and nonattribute preference—and reveals how much each of the three sources contributes to brand equity. This is done by taking into account not only the direct effects of these three sources on choice probabilities, but also the indirect effects through enhancing the brand’s availability. The method provides what-if analysis capabilities to predict the likely impacts of alternative strategies to enhance a brand’s equity. The survey-based results from applying the method to the digital cellular phone market in Korea show that the proposed approach has good face validity and convergent validity, with brand awareness playing the largest role, followed by nonattribute preference.
