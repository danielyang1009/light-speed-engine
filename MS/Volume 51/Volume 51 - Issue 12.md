### Abstract:
Using an unusually comprehensive database on 858 transactions for information technology products and accompanying services, we study how close partners who are exposed to opportunistic hazards structure and control a significant transaction. We analyze data on the terms of contracting to determine whether transaction and supplier characteristics that generate opportunistic hazards are related to the formal management control structure. We also examine whether misalignment between transaction and supplier characteristics and the control structure is associated with ex post performance problems. Characteristics associated with hazards are found to be positively related to contract extensiveness. Factor analysis of the use of 24 contract terms reveals four groups of contract terms that are commonly used in combination. We interpret these factors as “dimensions of management control” and label them: assignment of rights, product and price, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Characteristics associated with hazards are positively related to the use of all four dimensions of management control, with different hazards associated with different controls. We then examine the relation between transaction characteristics and ex post transaction problems, demonstrating that even in the presence of mutually agreeable contracts, hazards remain. We conclude that costs of contracting are associated with increased use of contract terms on assignment of rights, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Finally, we present evidence that management control structures that are better aligned with transaction hazards mitigate subsequent performance problems, though at a nontrivial cost of contracting.

### Abstract:
The majority of reverse auctions for procurement use a single-attribute (price) format while providing constraints on nonprice attributes such as quality and lead time. Alternatively, a buyer could choose to conduct a multiattribute auction where bidders can specify both a price and levels of nonprice attributes. While such an auction may provide higher theoretical utility to the buyer, it is not clear that this theoretical improvement will be realized given the increased complexity of the auction. In this research, we present an ascending auction mechanism for a buyer whose utility function is known and dependent on three attributes. Motivated by a supply chain procurement problem setting, we consider quality and lead time for the two attributes in addition to price. The auction mechanism provides the bidders with restricted feedback regarding the buyer’s utility function. We explore, experimentally, the performance of this multiattribute auction mechanism as compared to a price-only auction mechanism. Compared with the price-only auction, we find that our mechanism design is effective in increasing both buyer utility and bidder (supplier) profits.

## 4. The Effect of Asymmetric Bidder Size on an Auction’s Performance: Are More Bidders Always Better?
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
One commonly held belief in designing auctions is that increasing the number of bidders makes an auction more competitive. Therefore, a buyer who wishes to minimize her procurement costs is better off inviting more suppliers to participate. In this paper, we question the validity of this belief by shedding light on bidders’ behavior when bidders experience economies of scale in production and differ in their production capacity. We consider a setting with two different sized bidders, global and small. We assume that global bidders have a large production capacity (can win in more than one auction) and experience economies of scale in production, whereas small bidders can win in at most one auction. In this new setting, we focus on the impact of allowing both global and small suppliers to compete against each other on the performance of an auction.

## 5. Investment Decisions and Time Horizon: Risk Perception and Risk Behavior in Repeated Gambles
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
To investigate the effect of time horizon on investment behavior, this paper reports the results of an experiment in which business graduate students provided certainty equivalents and judged various dimensions of the outcome distribution of simple gambles that were played either once or repeatedly for 5 or 50 times. Systematic mistakes in the ex-ante estimations of the distributions of outcomes after (independent) repeated plays were observed. Despite correctly realizing that outcome standard deviation increases with the number of plays, respondents showed evidence of Samuelson’s (1963) fallacy of large numbers. Perceived risk judgments showed only low correlations with standard deviation estimates, but were instead related to the anticipated probability of a loss (which was overestimated), mean excess loss, and the coefficient of variation. Implications for future research and practical implications for financial advisors are discussed.

## 6. The Effects of Imprecise Probabilities and Outcomes in Evaluating Investment Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2005
### Abstract:
Vagueness attitudes have been used to explain anomalies and irregularities in investment behavior. It is generally assumed (Ellsberg 1961) that decision makers (DMs) dislike vagueness, but this assumption has been challenged by empirical results documenting systematic alternative attitudes to vagueness as a function of its source, the domain of the decisions, and the response mode used. We investigate these three factors in a within-subjects design that was embedded in an investment context. DMs evaluated investment options that varied in terms of their sources of vagueness (probabilities and/or outcomes), in both domains (gains or losses), and employed two response modes (pricing or choice). We confirm that individuals’ vagueness attitudes are malleable, contingent on the dimension salience and the reference domain. In particular, we observed three distinct patterns of “reversals of attitudes” towards vagueness. Our results indicate that the ability of vagueness attitudes to predict investment behavior is limited, as decisions can be systematically influenced by task context and/or perceived gain or loss positions. Economic models may be improved by incorporating more flexible assumptions about individuals’ attitudes toward vagueness.

## 8. Skewness Preference, Risk Aversion, and the Precedence Relations on Stochastic Changes
### Author(s):
- W. Henry Chiu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2005
### Abstract:
This paper provides a general choice-theoretic characterization of the trade-off between risk and skewness, whose importance in understanding risk-taking behavior is well documented in empirical studies. The condition under which the prudence measure (Kimball 1990) characterizes the strength of an individual’s downside-risk aversion against his own risk aversion is identified and interpreted in a unifying framework based on the concept of one stochastic dominant change preceding another and that of the desirability of a stochastic change. The framework is also shown to be useful for a better understanding of the Arrow-Pratt measure, the stronger Ross measure, and the coincidence of the characterizations of downside-risk aversion and prudence, as well as the relationship between stochastic dominances of different degrees.

## 9. The Effect of Payoff Feedback and Information Pooling on Reasoning Errors: Evidence from Experimental Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2005
### Abstract:
A vast literature shows that individuals frequently violate normative principles in reasoning. In this paper, we report the results of four studies designed to determine if information dissemination in competitive auctions can reduce, or even eliminate, logical errors in the Wason selection task. Our results show that payoff feedback and exposure to the information flow drive the aggregate behavior toward the normative solution. We also found evidence of spillover effects from informed to uninformed traders in one-sided combinatorial auctions, as well as positive transfer effects from competitive to individual settings.

## 10. Pricing and Resource Allocation in Caching Services with Multiple Levels of Quality of Service

### Abstract:
Network caches are the storage centers in the supply chain for content delivery—the digital equivalent of warehouses. Operated by access networks and other operators, they provide benefits to content publishers in the forms of bandwidth cost reduction, response time improvement, and handling of flash crowds. Yet, caching has not been fully embraced by publishers, because its use can interfere with site personalization strategies and/or collection of visitor information for business intelligence purposes. While recent work has focused on technological solutions to these issues, this paper provides the first study of the managerial issues related to the design and provisioning of incentive-compatible caching services. Starting with a single class of caching service, we find conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should offer the service for free. This occurs when the access networks’ bandwidth costs are high and a large fraction of content publishers value personalization and business intelligence. Some publishers will still opt out of the service, i.e., cache bust, as observed in practice. We next derive the conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should provision two vertically differentiated service classes, namely, premium and best effort. Interestingly, caching service differentiation is different from traditional vertical differentiation models, in that the premium and best-effort market segments do not abut. Thus, optimal prices for the two service classes can be set independently and cannibalization does not occur. It is possible for the cache operator to continue to offer the best-effort service for free while charging for the premium service. Furthermore, consumers are better off because more content is cached and delivered faster to them. Finally, we find that declining bandwidth costs will put negative pressure on cache operator profits, unless consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the availability of multimedia content provide the necessary increase in traffic volume for the caches.

## 11. Simple Models for Multiattribute Choice with Many Alternatives: When It Does and Does Not Pay to Face Trade-offs with Binary Attributes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2005
### Abstract:
Given the difficulties people experience in making trade-offs, what are the consequences of using simple models that avoid trade-offs? We examine choices by such models in environments where “true” preferences are linear and attributes are characterized by binary attributes. A deterministic elimination-by-aspects (DEBA) model is highly effective over a range of conditions. When preferences are quite compensatory, however, a modified equal weighting (EW) model that uses DEBA to resolve ties is more effective. We explore the sensitivity of results to errors in using DEBA, to different distributions of alternatives, and to error in “true” preferences. Under the conditions examined here, the outcomes of these “boundedly rational” models are highly consistent with “rational” models that explicitly confront trade-offs. We emphasize the importance of binary attributes in reaching these conclusions.

## 12. Tailored Supply Chain Decision Making Under Price-Sensitive Stochastic Demand and Delivery Uncertainty
### Author(s):

- 1 Dec 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study a serial two-echelon supply chain selling a procure-to-stock product in a price-sensitive market. Our analytical modelling framework incorporates optimal pricing and stocking decisions for both echelons in the presence of stochastic demand and random delivery times. We focus on understanding how these decisions for the chain are affected by its management paradigm (centralized or decentralized), and its business characteristics—price sensitivity, demand uncertainty, and delivery time variability. A novel combination of transformations enables us to analyze the framework and determine the unique optimal choices for centralized and wholesale price-based decentralized supply chains. More detailed investigation reveals that, in general, the business characteristics influence both the behavior and the optimal values of the decision variables, while the management paradigm primarily governs the optimal values. We illustrate the significance of these results in terms of how managers should tailor their decisions to align with their business requirements. Subsequently, comparison of the optimal profits between the channel partners and the management paradigms provides implications for decentralization strategy. A decentralized chain is most inefficient for moderately price-sensitive customers and uncertain environments, but is relatively more effective when dealing with mature products. We propose a contracting scheme that can improve the decentralized chain profit in reliable delivery time settings. The salient modelling insight of this paper is that ignoring the randomness of delivery time trivializes the interaction between pricing and stocking decisions. On the other hand, from a managerial viewpoint, we establish that optimal pricing policies provide the means to increase revenue and also act as strategic tools for tackling uncertainty.
