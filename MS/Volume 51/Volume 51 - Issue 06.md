### Abstract:
Information technology can link geographically separated people and help them locate interesting or useful resources. These attributes have the potential to bridge gaps and unite communities. Paradoxically, they also have the potential to fragment interaction and divide groups. Advances in technology can make it easier for people to spend more time on special interests and to screen out unwanted contact. Geographic boundaries can thus be supplanted by boundaries on other dimensions. This paper formally defines a precise set of measures of information integration and develops a model of individual knowledge profiles and community affiliation. These factors suggest specific conditions under which improved access, search, and screening can either integrate or fragment interaction on various dimensions. As IT capabilities continue to improve, preferences—not geography or technology—become the key determinants of community boundaries.

### Abstract:
Learning by doing represents an important mechanism through which organizations prosper. Some firms, however, learn from their experience at a dramatic rate, while other firms exhibit very little learning at all. Three factors have been identified that affect the rate at which firms learn: (a) the proficiency of individual workers, (b) the ability of firm members to leverage knowledge accumulated by others, and (c) the capacity for coordinated activity inside the organization. Each factor varies with a particular kind of experience. An increase in cumulative individual experience increases individual proficiency. An increase in cumulative organizational experience provides individuals with the opportunity to benefit from knowledge accumulated by others. An increase in cumulative experience working together promotes more effective coordination and teamwork. To gain insight into factors responsible for the learning curve, we examine the contribution of each kind of experience to performance, while controlling for the impact of the other two. The study context is a teaching hospital. The task is a total joint replacement procedure, and the performance metric is procedure completion time. We find that each kind of experience makes a distinct contribution to team performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the learning-by-doing framework in general, and learning in the team context in particular.

## 3. Things Change: Dynamic Resource Constraints and System-Dependent Selection in the Evolution of Organizational Populations

### Abstract:
An extensive empirical literature has demonstrated the existence of density-dependent selection in organizational vital rates. This research has also shown that historical trajectories followed by organizational populations only partly conform to the predictions of the original model. Inconsistencies with the model’s predictions prompt a series of questions: Why do organizational populations suddenly collapse after reaching a peak? Why do organizational populations oscillate after collapsing? What causes extinction of organizational forms? To address these questions, scholars have proposed a variety of modifications to the original model of density dependence. All have merit, but none is completely satisfying. The main objective of this study is to narrow the gap between theories, models, and observed historical trajectories by identifying a unitary analytical framework that can account for the variety of empirical trajectories typically followed by mature organizational populations. The model that we present is based on the hypothesis of system-dependent selection, according to which patterns of resource availability are produced by processes that are partly endogenous to organizational populations. The main analytical insight of the study is that under conditions of dynamic resource constraints introduced by system-dependent selection, the presence of population-level inertia leads to a rich variety of historical trajectories during population maturity. We show that this result holds in the absence of any particular assumption about the microstructure of organizational populations. Possible trajectories include sustained oscillations, resurgence, and extinction.

## 4. Measuring Customer Relationships: The Case of the Retail Banking Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Arguing that GAAP is ill suited for estimating the future profitability of intangibles, the accounting literature (e.g., Kaplan and Norton 1996, Lev 2001) has recently proposed alternative measurement models. These models view intangibles as composed of a set of fundamental business activities and use multiple financial and nonfinancial metrics causally interlinked to profits to represent this view. Using a unique and proprietary cross-sectional data set of the retail banking industry, we provide some of the first tests on the empirical validity of such measurement models. We characterize the core deposit intangible, an important retail banking intangible representing a bank’s relationships with its customers, using financial and nonfinancial metrics on price, service, customer usage, and customer satisfaction. We find that the metrics do not individually predict future earnings, but gain individual significance in a collective setting, increasing the predictive power substantially. We argue that this result occurs because the activities underlying the measures are causally interlinked to profits and explicitly illustrate these linkages with a structural path model. Our measurement model also predicts significant interactive effects in the way our measures are informative about future profits, and we document such effects, not just among the individual measures, but also across the measures and environmental factors such as the bank’s strategy. In sum, our measurement model illustrates the key drivers, measures, and interactions in retail banking customer relationships.

## 5. Corporate Disclosure and Operational Strategy: Financial vs. Operational Success
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
We introduce a simple game between two rival firms—a leader and a follower, where the leader moves first and makes an operational choice under uncertainty. The leader’s disclosure of its resulting financial success or failure may in turn give the follower a competitive advantage by informing its operational choice. When this occurs, the leader reacts by sometimes making an operational choice that it knows to be less likely to produce operational success than the alternative. This makes the financial report less useful to the follower and expected financial success more likely for the leader. Alternatively, when the financial report does not provide useful information to the follower (e.g., the financial report aggregates many activities in addition to the activity the follower is interested in), it may be the follower rather than the leader who makes the choice less likely to be operationally successful. We document that when trading off operational success for financial success, the leader’s aim is operational unpredictability, while the follower’s aim is coordination. As such, this paper highlights the intricate interplay between internal operational decisions, public inferences concerning those decisions, and different forms of success under intense competition.

## 6. Detecting Regime Shifts: The Causes of Under- and Overreaction
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Many decision makers operate in dynamic environments in which markets, competitors, and technology change regularly. The ability to detect and respond to these regime shifts is critical for economic success. We conduct three experiments to test how effective individuals are at detecting such regime shifts. Specifically, we investigate when individuals are most likely to underreact to change and when they are most likely to overreact to it. We develop a system-neglect hypothesis: Individuals react primarily to the signals they observe and secondarily to the environmental system that produced the signal. The experiments, two involving probability estimation and one involving prediction, reveal a behavioral pattern consistent with our system-neglect hypothesis: Underreaction is most common in unstable environments with precise signals, and overreaction is most common in stable environments with noisy signals. We test this pattern formally in a statistical comparison of the Bayesian model with a parametric specification of the system-neglect model.

## 7. Treatment Errors in Healthcare: A Safety Climate Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
Recent reports on patient safety in healthcare point to the high frequency of treatment errors. This study suggests a new theory of safety climate and brings empirical evidence that helps explain the occurrence of treatment errors. Four safety climate dimensions have been identified. They include employee perceptions of the suitability of the organization’s safety procedures for their daily work, employee perceptions of the frequency and the clarity of the safety information distributed by the organization, the way employees interpret their managers’ safety practices, and the perceived priority given to safety within the organization. The study was conducted in 21 medical units in a general hospital and the results were cross-validated in 15 units in another hospital. Results demonstrated that perceived suitable safety procedures and frequent and clear information flow reduced treatment errors only when managers practiced safety and through their influence on the level of priority given to safety within the unit. Implications for safety climate theory and for reducing the occurrence of treatment errors by safety interventions are discussed.

## 8. Information Sharing in a Supply Chain Under ARMA Demand

### Abstract:
In this paper we study how the time-series structure of the demand process affects the value of information sharing in a supply chain. We consider a two-stage supply chain model in which a retailer serves autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) demand and a manufacturer fills the retailer’s orders. We characterize three types of situations based on the parameters of the demand process: (i) the manufacturer benefits from inferring demand information from the retailer’s orders; (ii) the manufacturer cannot infer demand, but benefits from sharing demand information; and (iii) the manufacturer is better off neither inferring nor sharing, but instead uses only the most recent orders in its production planning. Using the example of ARMA(1,1) demand, we find that sharing or inferring retail demand leads to a 16.0% average reduction in the manufacturer’s safety-stock requirement in cases (i) and (ii), but leads to an increase in the manufacturer’s safety-stock requirement in (iii). Our results apply not only to two-stage but also to multistage supply chains.

## 9. Order Quantity and Timing Flexibility in Supply Chains: The Role of Demand Characteristics
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
We study how differences in product demand characteristics affect the strategic value of different types of supply chain flexibility for accurate response. We propose a single-period inventory modelling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility: quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling. In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for alternate demand types. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process. The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods, especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long.

## 10. Research Note: A Dynamic Programming Approach to Customer Relationship Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
The practice of offering discounts to prospective customers represents a rudimentary form of using transaction history measures to customize the marketing mix. Furthermore, the proliferation of powerful customer relationship management (CRM) systems is providing the data and the communications channels necessary to extend this type of pricing strategy into true dynamic marketing policies that adjust pricing as customer relationships evolve. In this paper, we describe a dynamic programming–based approach to creating optimal relationship pricing policies. The methodology has two main components. The first component is a latent class logit model that is used to model customer buying behavior. The second component is a dynamic optimization procedure that computes profit-maximizing price paths. The methodology is illustrated using subscriber data provided by a large metropolitan newspaper.

## 11. Probabilistic Inversion of Expert Judgments in the Quantification of Model Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Bernd Kraan

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
Expert judgment is frequently used to assess parameter values of quantitative management science models, particularly in decision-making contexts. Experts can, however, only be expected to assess observable quantities, not abstract model parameters. This means that we need a method for translating expert assessed uncertainties on model outputs into uncertainties on model parameter values. This process is called probabilistic inversion. The probability distribution on model parameters obtained in this way can be used in a variety of ways, but in particular in an uncertainty analysis or as a Bayes prior. This paper discusses computational algorithms that have proven successful in various projects and gives examples from environmental modelling and banking. Those algorithms are given a theoretical basis by adopting a minimum information approach to modelling partial information. The role of minimum information is two-fold: It enables us to resolve the problem of nonuniqueness of distributions given the information we have, and it provides numerical stability to the algorithm by guaranteeing convergence properties.

## 12. Research Note: Customer Intimacy and Cross-Selling Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2005
### Abstract:
Better targeting opportunities and the increasing role of information-intensive environments have created new challenges for firms in obtaining customer information. Such information can help firms increase their profits through cross-selling opportunities. However, revealing personal preferences and contact information can raise the risks for customers when dealing with a firm. Consequently, some customers trade off the benefit and risks of revealing information. As the opportunity to obtain a higher level of information increases, customers incur a higher level of risk when dealing with a firm. This increases the firm’s incentive to commit on a cross-selling level. By such a commitment, a firm can obtain customer intimacy and benefit from detailed customer information. As a result, profits increase while prices decrease. Thus, legal regulations that explicitly require firms to spell out the extent of cross-selling may actually improve the profits of the firm.
