## 1. Conspicuous Consumption and Sophisticated Thinking
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Consumers purchase conspicuous goods to satisfy not only material needs but also social needs such as prestige. In an attempt to meet these social needs, producers of conspicuous goods like cars, perfumes, and watches, highlight the exclusivity of their products. In this paper, we propose a monopoly model of conspicuous consumption using the rational expectations framework, and then examine how purchase decisions are affected by the desire for exclusivity and conformity. We show that snobs can have an upward-sloping demand curve but only in the presence of consumers who are (weakly) followers. Laboratory tests lend support for this model prediction and for the rational expectations framework. The experimental results suggest that subjects used some degree of sophisticated thinking to arrive at their first-period decisions. Their behavior in the subsequent trials, however, can be adequately captured by a purely adaptive learning mechanism. We discuss the implications of consumer learning for optimal dynamic pricing policy by a monopolist.

### Abstract:
Financial theory posits that capital markets convey through stock prices their expectation of the firm’s future performance. We use concepts from principal-agent theory and prospect theory to provide a theoretical explanation for the role stock price variation plays in managerial decision making. We then empirically investigate what specific decisions managers undertake in response to stock price variation. We perform our empirical analyses in the context of the pharmaceutical industry. We find that drug firms whose stock underperformed the industry react differently than drug firms with high-performing stocks. Specifically, laggards tend to implement more changes to their current product portfolio and distribution than high-performing firms. The more laggards underperform, the more they implement acquisitions aimed to produce immediate improvement in the firm’s product portfolio. In contrast, drug firms whose stocks outperform the industry tend to make fewer changes to their current portfolio and distribution. Instead, they focus more on long-term research and development and marketing of existing products. We interpret these findings in light of industry key success factors.

## 3. Bundling with Customer Self-Selection: A Simple Approach to Bundling Low-Marginal-Cost Goods
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
With declining costs of distributing digital products comes renewed interest in strategies for pricing goods with low marginal costs. In this paper, we evaluate customized bundling, a pricing strategy that gives consumers the right to choose up to a quantity M of goods drawn from a larger pool of N different goods for a fixed price. We show that the complex mixed-bundle problem can be reduced to the customized-bundle problem under some commonly used assumptions. We also show that, for a monopoly seller of low marginal cost goods, this strategy outperforms individual selling (M = 1) and pure bundling (M = N) when goods have a positive marginal cost or when customers have heterogeneous preferences over goods. Comparative statics results also show that the optimal bundle size for customized bundling decreases in both heterogeneity of consumer preferences over different goods and marginal costs of production. We further explore how the customized-bundle solution is affected by factors such as the nature of distribution functions in which valuations are drawn, the correlations of values across goods, and the complementarity or substitutability among products. Altogether, our results suggest that customized bundling has a number of advantages—both in theory and practice—over other bundling strategies in many relevant settings.

## 4. Two-Sided Network Effects: A Theory of Information Product Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
How can firms profitably give away free products? This paper provides a novel answer and articulates trade-offs in a space of information product design. We introduce a formal model of two-sided network externalities based in textbook economics—a mix of Katz and Shapiro network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation. Externality-based complements, however, exploit a different mechanism than either tying or lock-in even as they help to explain many recent strategies such as those of firms selling operating systems, Internet browsers, games, music, and video.

## 5. The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
Motivated by a $2.2 billion inventory write-off by Cisco Systems, we investigate how duplicate orders can lead a manufacturer to err in estimating the demand rate and customers’ sensitivity to delay, and to make faulty decisions about capacity investment. We consider a manufacturer that sells through two distributors. If a customer finds that his distributor is out of stock, then he will sometimes seek to make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out of stock, the customer will order from both distributors. When his order is filled by one of the distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate orders. Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders after a random period of time.

## 6. Optimal Policies for Transshipping Inventory in a Retail Network
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
Motivated by recent reports of improved customer service facilitated by the use of transshipment to pool inventory, we develop a formal model that focuses on the role of transshipment in a system of n-retailers who stock a good. In addition, some stock may be kept at a warehouse. If a retailer faces a stockout, he makes an attempt to fill backorders by using a transshipment that may come either from the warehouse or from another retailer that has excess stock. We determine that the optimal transshipment policy is described by exactly one of five protocols, and that the choice among them can be made by evaluating a set of easily computable conditions. We also provide other structural results that help identify conditions under which a warehouse should be open: how this decision is influenced by the total number of retailers, and how this decision is related to the degree of correlation of demand between retailers.

## 7. Transshipment and Its Impact on Supply Chain Members’ Performance
### Author(s):
- Jun Zhang
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
This note extends some of the key results of Dong and Rudi (2004) to general demand distributions. This generalization is achieved in two steps. First, we build on the analysis of Dong and Rudi to demonstrate that an inventory problem with transshipment is equivalent to a newsvendor problem with an adjusted demand. Then, we study the impact of transshipment by comparing the adjusted demand with the original demand. In addition to extending the results in the existing literature, this note presents a novel approach for analyzing the impact of risk pooling.

## 8. Hub Arc Location Problems: Part I—Introduction and Results
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
Hub networks play an important role in many transportation and telecommunications systems. This paper introduces a new model called the hub arc location model. Rather than locate discrete hub facilities, this model locates hub arcs, which have reduced unit flow costs. Four special cases of the general hub arc location model are examined in detail. We provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal solutions, using data for U.S. air passenger traffic. Results are used to compare optimal costs, hub locations, and hub arc locations with corresponding hub median optimal solutions. The results reveal interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and regions for hubs. A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2005) presents integer programming formulations and solution algorithms for the new hub arc problems. It also provides details and computation times for these solution algorithms.

### Abstract:
A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2005) introduces new hub arc location models and analyzes optimal solutions, with special attention to spatial pattens and relationships. This paper provides integer programming formulations and optimal solution algorithms for these problems. We describe two optimal solution approaches in detail and compare their performance, using standard hub location data sets. We present implementation details and show how algorithms can be fine tuned based on characteristics of the data.

## 10. The Multiobjective Discrete Optimization Problem: A Weighted Min-Max Two-Stage Optimization Approach and a Bicriteria Algorithm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
We study the multiple objective discrete optimization (MODO) problem and propose two-stage optimization problems as subproblems to be solved to obtain efficient solutions. The mathematical structure of the first level subproblem has similarities to both Tchebycheff type of approaches and a generalization of the lexicographic max-ordering problem that are applicable to multiple objective optimization. We present some results that enable us to develop an algorithm to solve the bicriteria discrete optimization problem for the entire efficient set. We also propose a modification of the algorithm that generates a sample of efficient solutions that satisfies a prespecified quality guarantee. We apply the algorithm to solve the bicriteria knapsack problem. Our computational results on this particular problem demonstrate that our algorithm performs significantly better than an equivalent Tchebycheff counterpart. Moreover, the computational behavior of the sampling version is quite promising.

## 11. Weak-Form and Semi-Strong-Form Stock Return Predictability Revisited
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2005
### Abstract:
This paper makes indirect inference about the time variation in expected stock returns by comparing unconditional sample variances to estimates of expected conditional variances. The evidence reveals more predictability as more information is used, and there is no evidence that predictability has diminished in recent years. Semi-strong-form evidence suggests that time variation in expected returns remains economically important.
