### Abstract:
The trust-building process is basic to social science. We investigate it in a laboratory setting using a novel multistage trust game where social gains are achieved if players trust each other in each stage. In each stage, also, players have an opportunity to appropriate these gains or be trustworthy by sharing them. Players are strangers because they do not know the identity of others and they will not play them again. Thus, there is no prospect of future interaction to induce trusting behavior, and we study the trust-building process where there is little scope for social relations and networks.

### Abstract:
An increasing number of manufacturers have started to pursue a strategy that promotes inventory sharing among the dealers in their distribution network. In this paper we analyze a decentralized dealer network in which each independent dealer is given the flexibility to share his inventory. We model inventory sharing as a multiple demand classes problem in which each dealer faces his own customer demand with high priority, and inventory-sharing requests from other dealers with low priority. Assuming that each dealer uses a base-stock and threshold-rationing policy for his inventory-stocking and inventory-sharing decisions, we explicitly model the interactions between the dealers through inventory sharing and obtain a closed-form cost function for each dealer based on the steady-state distribution of the inventory levels at the two dealers. We then provide a detailed supermodularity analysis of the inventory-sharing and inventory-rationing game in which each dealer has a two-dimensional strategy set (stocking level and rationing level). We show that the full-sharing game (in which dealers precommit to sharing all of their on-hand inventory) and the fixed-sharing-level game (in which dealers precommit to sharing a portion of their on-hand inventory) are supermodular, and thus a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist. For the rationing game (in which dealers precommit to their stocking levels), we show that there exists a dominant strategy equilibrium on the dealers‚Äô sharing (rationing) levels. Finally, a comprehensive computational study is conducted to highlight the impact of the manufacturer‚Äôs incentives, subsidies, and/or transshipment fees on the dealers‚Äô sharing behavior.

## 3. On the Benefits of Pooling in Production-Inventory Systems

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
We study inventory pooling in systems with symmetric costs where supply lead times are endogenously generated by a finite-capacity production system. We investigate the sensitivity of the cost advantage of inventory pooling to various system parameters, including loading, service levels, demand and production time variability, and structure of the production system. The analysis reveals differences in how various parameters affect the cost reduction from pooling and suggests that these differences stem from the manner in which the parameters influence the induced correlation between lead-time demands of the demand streams. We compare these results with those obtained for pure inventory systems, where lead times are exogenous. We also compare inventory pooling with several forms of capacity pooling.

## 4. Option Pricing with Downward-Sloping Demand Curves: The Case of Supply Chain Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
This article investigates the role of option contracts in a supply chain when the demand curve is downward sloping. We consider call (put) options that provide the retailer with the right to reorder (return) goods at a fixed price. We show that the introduction of option contracts causes the wholesale price to increase and the volatility of the retail price to decrease. In general, options are not zero-sum games. Conditions are derived under which the manufacturer prefers to use options. When this happens the retailer is also better off, if the uncertainty in the demand curve is low. However, if the uncertainty is sufficiently high, then the introduction of option contracts alters the equilibrium prices in a way that hurts the retailer.

## 5. Diversification and the Optimal Construction of Basis Portfolios
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
Nontrivial diversification possibilities arise when a factor model describes security returns. This paper catalogs the merits of alternative strategies for constructing basis portfolios to mimic the common factors. We show how to use the ùúí2 statistic for the joint significance of mean basis portfolio returns to rank alternative procedures and the bootstrap to perform inferences on the disparity between ùúí2 statistics across portfolio formation procedure, estimation method, cross-section size, and number of factors. Our main conclusion is that maximum likelihood factor analysis coupled with minimum idiosyncratic risk portfolio formation yields economically and statistically superior basis portfolios compared with those derived from asymptotic principal components.

## 6. Bertrand Supertraps

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
We study oligopoly price competition between multiproduct firms‚Äîfirms whose products interact in the profit function. Specifically, we focus on the impact of intrafirm product interactions on the level of equilibrium profits. This impact may be decomposed in two different ways: (a) a direct effect (keeping the competitors‚Äô actions fixed) plus a strategic effect (i.e., through the competitors‚Äô actions); or, alternatively, (b) a competitive advantage effect (change in firm i only) plus an imitation effect (change in all other firms). We derive conditions such that (a) the strategic effect more than outweighs the direct effect, and conditions such that (b) the imitation effect more than outweighs the competitive advantage effect: Bertrand supertraps. For example, an increase in the degree of economies of scope would increase profits if prices were fixed or if the change were limited to firm i‚Äôs cost function. However, if all firms increase the degree of economies of scope then all firms receive lower profits. A variety of other applications is considered, including learning curves, core competencies, demand synergies, systems competition, compatibility, bundling, network effects, switching costs, durable goods, long-term contracts.

## 7. Integrated Scheduling of Production and Distribution Operations

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
Motivated by applications in the computer and food catering service industries, we study an integrated scheduling model of production and distribution operations. In this model, a set of jobs (i.e., customer orders) are first processed in a processing facility (e.g., manufacturing plant or service center) and then delivered to the customers directly without intermediate inventory. The problem is to find a joint schedule of production and distribution such that an objective function that takes into account both customer service level and total distribution cost is optimized. Customer service level is measured by a function of the times when the jobs are delivered to the customers. The distribution cost of a delivery shipment consists of a fixed charge and a variable cost proportional to the total distance of the route taken by the shipment. We study two classes of problems under this integrated scheduling model. In the first class of problems, customer service is measured by the average time when the jobs are delivered to the customers; in the second class, customer service is measured by the maximum time when the jobs are delivered to the customers. Two machine configurations in the processing facility‚Äîsingle machine and parallel machine‚Äîare considered. For each of the problems studied, we provide an efficient exact algorithm, or a proof of intractability accompanied by a heuristic algorithm with worst-case and asymptotic performance analysis. Computational experiments demonstrate that the heuristics developed are capable of generating near-optimal solutions. We also investigate the possible benefit of using the proposed integrated model relative to a sequential model where production and distribution operations are scheduled sequentially and separately. Computational tests show that in many cases a significant benefit can be achieved by integration.

## 8. The Impact of Contractor Behavior on the Client‚Äôs Payment-Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Joseph G. Szmerekovsky
### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
Recent approaches to modeling the client‚Äôs payment-scheduling problem allow the client to control both the timing of payments and the completion times of activities. In practice, the activity schedule is typically determined by the contractor rather than the client. This paper addresses this drawback by considering a model in which the client selects the payment activities and the contractor selects the activity schedule, each to maximize his own net present value (NPV). In addition, the contractor has the option to reject the project if it does not provide a minimum NPV. The new model is shown to be NP-hard in the strong sense and a branch-and-bound procedure is provided for its solution. Results are obtained for the new model that contradict those of the older models. The benefits to the client are no longer increasing with retention and no longer decreasing with the number of payments. Furthermore, it is no longer ideal for the client to focus payments at the beginning and end of the project. Empirical evidence based on a randomly generated data set suggests that the market for the contractor‚Äôs services, the timing of benefits received by the client, and the project duration drive these new results.

## 9. The Corporate Digital Divide: Determinants of Internet Adoption
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
The diffusion of Internet technology among firms is widely considered to be one of the primary factors behind the rapid economic growth of the 1990s. However, little systematic study has examined the variation in firm decisions to adopt the Internet. I explore the sources of this variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998.

## 10. Optimal Allocation of Proposals to Reviewers to Facilitate Effective Ranking

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
Peer review of research proposals and articles is an essential element in research and development processes worldwide. Here we consider a problem that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed until now: how to assign subsets of proposals to reviewers in scenarios where the reviewers supply their evaluations through ordinal ranking. The solution approach we propose for this assignment problem maximizes the number of proposal pairs that will be evaluated by one or more reviewers. This new approach should facilitate meaningful aggregation of partial rankings of subsets of proposals by multiple reviewers into a consensus ranking. We offer two ways to implement the approach: an integer-programming set-covering model and a heuristic procedure. The effectiveness and efficiency of the two models are tested through an extensive simulation experiment.

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
Consumers‚Äô average value for information goods, websites, weather forecasts, music, and news declines with the number consumed. This paper provides simple guidelines to optimal bundling marketing strategies in this case. If consumers‚Äô values do not decrease too quickly, we show that bundling is approximately optimal. If consumers‚Äô values to subsequent goods decrease quickly, we show by example that one should expect bundling to be suboptimal.

## 12. Research Note‚ÄîCost Uncertainty Is Bliss: The Effect of Competition on the Acquisition of Cost Information for Pricing New Products
### Author(s):
- Markus Christen
### Published:
- 1 Apr 2005
### Abstract:
We examine the optimal acquisition of information about a common uncertain cost factor by two competing firms seeking to price a new product. We show that existing findings regarding the acquisition of demand information or the acquisition of either cost or demand information related to quantity decisions do not extend to this case. For cost information with price competition, the information acquisition strategies are strategic substitutes, even though the price decisions that are based on the information are strategic complements. Competition decreases the expected value of cost information. Moreover, when competition is intense and the cost of information low, identical firms do not acquire the same amount of cost information‚Äîeven when information is free. Cost uncertainty acts like a ‚Äúfog‚Äù that lessens the destructive effect of price competition when products are close substitutes, and thus increases expected profits. Buyers, on the other hand, are better off when competing firms are informed about cost. Even though the expected value of cost information strictly decreases with competition, the optimal price for industry-specific cost information set by an information vendor increases with competition when the firms‚Äô products are sufficiently substitutable.

### Abstract:
The conventional parameterizations of cumulative prospect theory do not explain the St. Petersburg paradox. To do so, the power coefficient of an individual‚Äôs utility function must be lower than the power coefficient of an individual‚Äôs probability weighting function.
