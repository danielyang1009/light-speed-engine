## 2. Incentives Between Firms (and Within)
### Author(s):
- Robert Gibbons
### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper reviews the significant progress in “agency theory” (i.e., the economic theory of incentives) during the 1990s, with an eye toward applications to supply transactions. I emphasize six recent models, in three pairs: (1) new foundations for the theory of incentive contracts, (2) new directions in incentive theory, and (3) new applications to supply transactions. By reviewing these six models, I hope to establish three things. First, the theory of incentive contracts needed and received new foundations. Second, new directions in incentive theory teach us that incentive contracts are not the only source of incentives. Finally (and especially relevant to supply transactions), the integration decision is an instrument in the incentive problem.

### Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium behavior of decentralized supply chains with competing retailers under demand uncertainty. We also design contractual arrangements between the parties that allow the decentralized chain to perform as well as a centralized one. We address these questions in the context of two-echelon supply chains with a single supplier servicing a network of (competing) retailers, considering the following general model: Retailers face random demands, the distribution of which may depend only on its own retail price (noncompeting retailers) or on its own price as well as those of the other retailers (competing retailers), according to general stochastic demand functions.

## 4. Supply Chain Coordination with Revenue-Sharing Contracts: Strengths and Limitations

### Abstract:
Under a revenue-sharing contract, a retailer pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased, plus a percentage of the revenue the retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the videocassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer's purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or outright sales. Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i.e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain's profit. We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e.g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that revenue sharing is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case. Revenue sharing also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing in quantities, e.g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several limitations of revenue sharing to (at least partially) explain why it is not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in which revenue sharing provides only a small improvement over the administratively cheaper wholesale price contract. Additionally, revenue sharing does not coordinate a supply chain with demand that depends on costly retail effort. We develop a variation on revenue sharing for this setting.

## 5. Competition in Multiechelon Assembly Supply Chains
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study competition in multiechelon supply chains with an assembly structure. Firms in the supply chain are grouped into homogenous sectors (nodes) that contain identical firms with identical production capabilities that all produce exactly one undifferentiated product (that may itself be a “kit” of components). Each sector may use several inputs to produce its product, and these inputs are supplied by different sectors. The production process within any sector is taken to be pure assembly in fixed proportions. The number of firms in each sector is known. The demand curve for the final product is assumed to be linear, as are production costs in all sectors. Competition is modeled via a “coordinated successive Cournot” model in which firms choose production quantities for their downstream market so as to maximize profits, given prices for all inputs and all complementary products. Production quantities for sectors supplying the same successor are coordinated through pricing mechanisms, so that complementary products are produced in the right proportions. Under these assumptions, equilibrium prices for any multiechelon assembly network are characterized by a system of linear equations. We derive closed-form expressions for equilibrium quantities and prices in any two-stage system (i.e., a system with multiple input sectors and a single assembly sector). We show that any assembly structure can be converted to an equivalent (larger) structure in which no more than two components are assembled at any node. Finally, large structures can be solved either by direct solution of the characteristic linear equations or through an iterative reduction (compression) to smaller structures.

## 6. Salesforce Incentives, Market Information, and Production/Inventory Planning
### Author(s):
- Fangruo Chen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
Salespeople are the eyes and ears of the firms they serve. They possess market knowledge that is critical for a wide range of decisions. A key question is how a firm can provide incentives to its salesforce so that it is in their interest to truthfully disclose their information about the market and to work hard. Many people have considered this question and provided solutions. Perhaps the most well-known solution is due to Gonik (1978), who proposed and implemented a clever scheme designed to elicit market information and encourage hard work. The purpose of this paper is to study Gonik's scheme and compare it with a menu of linear contracts—a solution often used in the agency literature—in a model where the market information possessed by the salesforce is important for the firm's production and inventory-planning decisions.

## 7. A Smart Market for Industrial Procurement with Capacity Constraints

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
We address the problem of designing multi-item procurement auctions for a monopsonistic buyer in capacity-constrained environments. Using insights from classical auction theory, we construct an optimization-based auction mechanism (“smart market”) relying on the dynamic resolution of a linear program minimizing the buyer's cost under the suppliers' capacity constraints. Suppliers can modify their offers in response to the optimal allocation corresponding to each set of bids, giving rise to a dynamic competitive bidding process. To assist suppliers, we also develop a bidding-suggestion device based on a myopic best-response (MBR) calculation that solves an associated optimization problem. Assuming linear costs for the suppliers, we study within a game-theoretic framework the sequence of bids arising in this smart market. Under a weak behavioral assumption and some symmetry requirements, an explicit upper bound for the winning bids is established. We then formulate a complete behavioral model and solution methodology based on the MBR rationale and show that the bounds derived earlier continue to hold. We analytically derive some structural and convergence properties of the MBR dynamics in the simplest nontrivial market environment, which suggests further possible design improvements, and investigate bidding dynamics and incentive compatibility issues via numerical simulations.

## 8. Formation of Alliances in Internet-Based Supply Exchanges
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
In different industries, such as automobiles, chemicals, or retailing, competitors are joining forces in establishing electronic marketplaces to reduce inefficiencies in the purchasing process and cut costs by combining their buying power. Joining such an alliance leads to reduced costs, including those of possible rivals, because members share the development and operating costs. A company that joins an alliance agrees to share its suppliers with others, which may lead to more intense competition among the increased number of suppliers, and it may further benefit an alliance member at the expense of companies left outside the alliance. Natural questions that could arise, then, are when would a firm prefer to take part in an electronic marketplace joint venture; when would it prefer that other firms, possibly rivals, join the venture; and what are the financial consequences of either joining an alliance or remaining independent? In an attempt to gain a better understanding of the issues, we have developed a model of three retailers whose products may have a certain degree of substitutability. We provide some conditions, in terms of product substitutability and compatibility of retailers, that would lead to the formation of a three-member alliance, or a two-member alliance, or no alliance at all. We also study the effect of alliance structure and compatibility of retailers on the profit of a company.

## 9. A Principal-Agent Model for Product Specification and Production

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
This paper develops and analyzes a principal-agent model for product specification and production motivated by “core buying” decisions at an automobile manufacturer. The model focuses on two important elements of the “core” buyer's responsibility: (1) assessing the supplier's capability, and (2) allocating some or all of a fixed level of some buyer-internal resource to help the supplier. Under the contracting scheme we model, the buyer (principal) delegates the majority of product specification and production activity to the supplier (agent), but retains the flexibility to commit a given, observable amount of an internally available, limited resource (e.g., engineering hours) to help the supplier. The supplier, in turn, allocates his resource (e.g., engineering hours) to produce the finished product. As in the motivating scenario, both the supplier's resource allocation and capability are assumed to be hidden from the buyer. Hence, the principal's problem is to determine a menu of (resource-commitment, transfer-price) contracts to minimize her total expected cost. Our analysis demonstrates that if buyer resource and supplier capability are substitutes, then the buyer's second-best involvement in the supplier's production process will be greater than first-best. The opposite is true if they are complements. Further, when the opportunity cost for the buyer's resource is zero, then in the substitutes case the buyer will commit all of its resource, while in the complements case the buyer may withhold some resources to screen the supplier type. We describe two applications of the model—one in inventory management and one in pharmaceutical drug discovery—to illustrate its applicability and versatility. Finally, we use insights from the model to suggest hypotheses for empirical study.

## 10. Agency Costs in a Supply Chain with Demand Uncertainty and Price Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
In this paper, we model a manufacturer that contracts with two retailers, who then choose retail prices and stocking quantities endogenously in a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. If the manufacturer designs a contract that is accepted by both retailers, it sets the wholesale price as a compromise between two conflicting roles: reducing intrabrand retail price competition and inducing retailers to stock closer to first-best levels (that is, optimum for the supply chain as a whole). In equilibrium, fill rates are less than first best. If, on the other hand, the manufacturer eliminates retail competition by designing a contract accepted by only one retailer, the assignment of consumers to retailers is inefficient. In either equilibrium, the performance of the supply chain is strictly less than first best. However, the manufacturer achieves first-best retail prices and fill rates if it can subsidize the retailers' leftover inventory. Absent such subsidies, the two-retailer equilibrium arises when the two retailers compete less intensively. In that equilibrium, numerical results indicate that the value of subsidizing unsold inventory is increasing in demand uncertainty, intensity of retail competition, and salvage value of inventory, and is decreasing in manufacturing cost and opportunity cost of shelf space.

## 11. Sell the Plant? The Impact of Contract Manufacturing on Innovation, Capacity, and Profitability
### Author(s):

- 1 Jan 2005
### Abstract:
In the electronics industry and others, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are selling their production facilities to contract manufacturers (CMs). The CMs achieve high capacity utilization through pooling (supplying many different OEMs). Meanwhile, the OEMs focus on innovation: research and development, product design, and marketing. We examine how this change in industry structure affects investment in innovation and capacity, and thus profitability. In particular, innovation is noncontractible, so OEMs will invest less in innovation than is ideal for the industry as a whole. Hence, although contract manufacturing improves capacity utilization, it may reduce the profitability of the industry as a whole by weakening the incentives for innovation. Contract manufacturing is not the only means to achieve capacity pooling. Alternatively, the OEMs can pool capacity with one another through supply contracts or a joint venture. This may result in underinvestment or overinvestment in innovation and capacity, but always increases profitability. We find that the sale of production facilities to a CM improves profitability for the industry as a whole if and only if OEMs are subsequently in a strong bargaining position vis-à-vis the CM. If the OEMs are indeed very strong, the gain from pooling capacity via contract manufacturing is maximized in industries with moderate cost of capacity.
