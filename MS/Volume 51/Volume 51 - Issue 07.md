### Abstract:
This paper examines the inventories of publicly traded American manufacturing companies between 1981 and 2000. The median of inventory holding periods were reduced from 96 days to 81 days. The average rate of inventory reduction is about 2% per year. The greatest reduction was found for work-in-process inventory, which declined by about 6% per year. Finished-goods inventories did not decline. Firms with abnormally high inventories have abnormally poor long-term stock returns. Firms with slightly lower than average inventories have good stock returns, but firms with the lowest inventories have only ordinary returns.

## 2. Incentives for Efficient Inventory Management: The Role of Historical Cost
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper examines inventory management from an incentive perspective. We show that when a manager has private information about future attainable revenues, the residual income performance measure based on historical cost can achieve optimal (second-best) incentives with regard to managerial effort as well as production and sales decisions. The LIFO (last-in–first-out) inventory flow rule is shown to be preferable to the FIFO (first-in–first-out) rule for the purpose of aligning incentives. Our analysis also finds support for the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory-valuation rule in situations where the manager receives new information after the initial contracting stage.

## 3. The Financial Impact of ISO 9000 Certification in the United States: An Empirical Analysis

### Abstract:
The ISO 9000 series of quality management systems standards, introduced in 1986, has been adopted at over 560,000 locations worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms can achieve internal benefits such as quality or productivity improvements or that certification can help firms maintain or increase their market share, or both. Others argue that the standard is too generic to cause performance improvement but can be seen as a signal of good management. In this paper, we track financial performance from 1987 to 1997 of all publicly traded ISO 9000 certified manufacturing firms in the United States with SIC codes 2000–3999, and test whether ISO 9000 certification leads to productivity improvements, market benefits, and improved financial performance. We employ event-study methods, matching each certified firm to a control group of one or more noncertified firms in the same industry with similar precertification size and/or return on assets. We find that firms’ decision to seek their first ISO 9000 certification was indeed followed by significant abnormal improvements in financial performance, though the exact timing and magnitude of this effect depend on the specification of the control group. Three years after certification, the certified firms do display strongly significant abnormal performance under all control-group specifications. The degree to which the precise results vary across control-group specifications indicates that event studies should always include extensive sensitivity analysis, for instance matching by size and performance separately and jointly, using both single firms and portfolios as controls.

## 4. Assessing the Resource Base of Japanese and U.S. Auto Producers: A Stochastic Frontier Production Function Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
The “resource-based view of the firm” has become an important conceptual framework in strategic management but has been widely criticized for lack of an empirical base. To address this deficit, we utilize a new method for identifying interfirm differences in efficiency within the context of stochastic frontier production functions. Using data on Japanese and U.S. automobile manufacturers, we develop measures of resources and capabilities and test for linkages with firm performance. The results show the influence of manufacturing proficiency and scale economies at the firm and plant level. We apply the parameter estimates to account for Toyota’s superior efficiency relative to other producers.

## 5. Soybean Inventory and Forward Curve Dynamics
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
We present two results concerning soybean prices. First, we exhibit a simple relationship between stocks and price volatility. The observation of an increasing price volatility with decreasing inventory is often mentioned in the literature, but has so far been documented using a proxy for inventory (see Fama and French 1987, 1988; Litzenberger and Rabinowitz 1995). Instead, we reconstruct a yearly, quarterly, and monthly database of worldwide soybean inventories using aggregate data from the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. We show that under all time scales, price volatility is an increasing linear function of inverse inventory, which we term “scarcity.” Second, we show how the addition of the factor scarcity in a state-variable approach to the dynamics of the term structure of soybean forward prices improves the quality of the fit. We document this property on a 25-year database of CBOT futures contracts and show that the superior accuracy also affects long-maturity futures contracts, an important property for the valuation of long-term origination contracts between producing countries and the agrifood industry.

## 6. Pricing Diagnostic Information
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Diagnostic information allows an agent to predict the state of nature about the success of an investment project better than the prior. We analyze the optimal pricing scheme for selling diagnostic information to buyers with different, privately known, ex ante success probability. Investment costs and returns of successful projects are assumed to be the same for all buyers. The value of diagnostic information is the difference in expected payoffs with and without it, and we show that the willingness to pay for diagnostic information is nonmonotonic in the ex ante success probability. When the information seller can offer only one quality level, and negative payments are not allowed, we find that the optimal menu of (linear) contracts is remarkably simple. A pure royalty is offered to buyers with low ex ante success probability, and a pure fixed fee is offered to buyers with high ex ante success probability.

## 7. Global Production Planning Under Exchange-Rate Uncertainty

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
Motivated by an aggregate production-planning problem in an actual global manufacturing network, we examine the impact of exchange-rate uncertainty on the choice of optimal production policies when the allocation decision can be deferred until the realization of exchange rates. This leads to the formulation of the problem as a two-stage recourse program whose optimal policy structure features two forms of flexibility denoted as operational hedging: (1) production hedging, where the firm deliberately produces less than the total demand; and (2) allocation hedging, where due to unfavorable exchange rates, some markets are not served despite having unused production. Our characterization of the optimal policy structure leads to an economic valuation of production and allocation hedging. We show that the prevalence of production hedging is moderated by the degree of correlation between exchange rates. A comprehensive examination under the following four generalized settings provides the depth, scope, and relevancy that our proposed operational hedges play to facilitate aggregate planning: (1) multiple periods, (2) demand uncertainty, (3) price setting or monopolistic pricing, and (4) price setting under demand uncertainty. We show that production and allocation hedging are robust for these generalizations and should be integrated into the overall aggregate planning strategy of a global manufacturing firm.

## 8. Personalized Pricing and Quality Differentiation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
We develop an analytical framework to investigate the competitive implications of personalized pricing (PP), whereby firms charge different prices to different consumers based on their willingness to pay. We embed PP in a model of vertical product differentiation and show how it affects firms’ choices over quality. We show that firms’ optimal pricing strategies with PP may be nonmonotonic in consumer valuations. When the PP firm has high quality, both firms raise their qualities relative to the uniform pricing case. Conversely, when the PP firm has low quality, both firms lower their qualities. Although many firms are trying to implement such pricing policies, we find that a higher-quality firm can actually be worse off with PP. While it is optimal for the firm adopting PP to increase product differentiation, the non-PP firm seeks to reduce differentiation by moving in closer in the quality space. While PP results in a wider market coverage, it also leads to aggravated price competition between firms. Because this entails a change in equilibrium qualities, the nature of the cost function determines whether firms gain or lose by implementing such PP policies. Despite the threat of first-degree price discrimination, we find that PP with competing firms can lead to an overall increase in consumer welfare.

## 9. Research Note—Price Discrimination After the Purchase: Rebates as State-Dependent Discounts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
Promotional tools such as rebates and coupons are usually seen as different ways of price discriminating among consumers. We focus on a different property of rebates: their ability to price discriminate within a consumer among her postpurchase states. Unlike price discrimination between consumers, this property is unique to rebates because, by design, they are redeemed after the purchase. (Coupons, by contrast, are redeemed with the purchase.) The consumer redeems the rebate only in postpurchase states in which her marginal utility of income is high. This selective redemption behavior provides an opportunity for the seller to “utility arbitrage,” directing discounts to when they matter most, resulting in an increase in the consumer’s up-front willingness to pay. In turn, this enables an increase in the regular price. Of course, rebates can still price discriminate among consumers. Indeed, their ability to deliver state-dependent discounts may enhance their overall price discrimination ability, as we show in an example comparing them to coupons.

## 10. Pricing and Allocation for Quality-Differentiated Online Services

### Published:

### Abstract:
We explore the problem of pricing and allocation of unique, one-time digital products in the form of data streams. We look at the short-term problem where the firm has a capacitated shared resource and multiple products or service levels. We formulate the allocatively efficient Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA) for our setting and point out the computational challenges in determining the individual discriminatory transfer payments. We propose an alternative uniform-price, computationally efficient, revenue-maximizing knapsack formulation called the Multiple Vickrey Auction (MVA). While not incentive compatible, the MVA mechanism achieves bounded posterior regret and can be solved in real time. It has the added benefit of realizing imputed commodity prices for the various services, a feature lacking in the discriminatory GVA approach. For service providers that are concerned about the incentive compatibility but want imputed service prices, we suggest a maximal MVA (mMVA) uniform-pricing scheme that trades off revenue maximization for allocative efficiency. For sake of completeness we discuss the properties of a first-price pay-your-bid scheme. While NP-hard and not incentive compatible, this formulation has the perceived benefit of cognitive simplicity on the parts of sellers and bidders.

## 11. Efficient Production-Distribution System Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2005
### Abstract:
The production-distribution system design is an integral part of the general supply chain design. This paper proposes a novel solution methodology for this problem that is based on Lagrangean relaxation, interior-point methods, and branch and bound. Unlike classical approaches, Lagrangean relaxation is applied in a two-level hierarchy, branch and bound is based on a Lagrangean lower bound and column generation (branch and price), while interior-point methods are used within a cutting-plane context (analytic centre cutting-plane method—ACCPM). Numerical results demonstrate that the two-level approach outperforms the classical approach and provides a very sharp lower bound that is the (proven) optimal in most cases.
