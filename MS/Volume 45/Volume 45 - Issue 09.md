### Abstract:
In this study we consider the linkage between productivity change and profit change. We develop an analytical framework in which profit change between one period and the next is decomposed into three sources: (i) a productivity change effect (which includes a technical change effect and an operating efficiency effect), (ii) an activity effect (which includes a product mix effect, a resource mix effect, and a scale effect), and (iii) a price effect. We then show how to quantify the contribution of each effect, using only observed prices and quantities of products and resources in the two periods. We illustrate our analytical decomposition of profit change with an empirical application to Spanish banking during the period 19871994.

## 2. Customer Satisfaction for Financial Services: The Role of Products, Services, and Information Technology

### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the drivers of customer satisfaction for financial services. We discuss a full Bayesian analysis based on data collected from customers of a leading financial services company. Our approach allows us to explicitly accommodate missing data and enables quantitative assessment of the impact of the drivers of satisfaction across the customer population. We find that satisfaction with product offerings is a primary driver of overall customer satisfaction. The quality of customer service with respect to financial statements and services provided through different channels of delivery, such as information technology enabled call centers and traditional branch offices, are also important in determining overall satisfaction. However, our analysis indicates that the impact of these service delivery factors may differ substantially across customer segments. In order to facilitate managerial action, we discuss how specific operational quality attributes for designing and delivering financial services can be leveraged to enhance satisfaction with product offerings and service delivery. Our approach and findings have significant implications for managing customer satisfaction in the financial services industry.

## 3. Process Variation as a Determinant of Bank Performance: Evidence from the Retail Banking Study

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper explores the relation between retail banks' branch-based processes and financial performance. There are 11 processes included in this study, which represent the bulk of the activities performed in a typical retail branch (e.g., opening checking accounts). The first finding of this study is that the financial performance of banks that perform better across these processes tend to be better than that of other banks. In addition to the variation in process performance across banks, there is also substantial variation across processes within banks. That is, banks that performed well in one process often performed quite badly in another. We present an analytical model that shows that improvement in process variation can be more important than improvement in aggregate process performance when dealing with certain customer segments. Empirical evidence from the Wharton Financial Institution Center Retail Banking Study of bank holding companies in the United States provides support.

## 4. Operations, Quality, and Profitability in the Provision of Banking Services
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1999
### Abstract:
We develop a framework for combining strategic benchmarking with efficiency benchmarking of the services offered by bank branches. In particular, a cascade of efficiency benchmarking models is developed guided by the service-profit chain. Three modelsbased on the nonparametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysisare developed in order to implement the framework in a practical setting: (i) an operational efficiency model, (ii) a service quality efficiency model, and (iii) a profitability efficiency model. The use of the models is illustrated using data from the branches of a commercial bank. Empirical results indicate that we gain superior insights by analyzing simultaneously the design of operations together with the quality of the provided services and profitability, rather than by benchmarking these three dimensions separately. Relationships are also established between operational efficiency and profitability, and between operational efficiency and service quality.

## 5. Innovations in Financial Services, Relationships, and Risk Sharing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1999
### Abstract:
Relationships between intermediaries and their customers have become increasingly important in recent years. This paper argues that the need for costly ex ante information acquisition and analysis is a major barrier to the participation of investors and firms in sophisticated markets. Long-term relationships between intermediaries and their customers, in which intermediaries provide implicit insurance to customers, can be an effective substitute for costly ex ante investigation. In this way, intermediaries allow firms and investors to reap the benefits of financial markets. Relationships are easiest to sustain when the ongoing benefits to both parties are high. As a result, competition may lower the benefits that can be obtained from relationships.

## 6. Organizational Form and Efficiency: The Coexistence of Stock and Mutual Property-Liability Insurers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1999
### Abstract:
This article introduces a new approach, cross-frontier analysis, for estimating the relative efficiency of alternative organizational forms in an industry. The technique is illustrated by analyzing a sample of stock and mutual property-liability insurers using nonparametric frontier efficiency methods. Cross-frontier analysis measures the relative efficiency of each organizational form by computing the efficiency of each stock (mutual) firm relative to a reference set consisting of all mutual (stock) firms. We test agency-theoretic hypotheses about organizational form, including the managerial discretion and expense preference hypotheses. The results indicate that stocks and mutuals are operating on separate production and cost frontiers and thus represent distinct technologies. Consistent with the managerial discretion hypothesis, the stock technology dominates the mutual technology for producing stock outputs and the mutual technology dominates the stock technology for producing mutual outputs. However, consistent with the expense preference hypothesis, the stock cost frontier dominates the mutual cost frontier. Our findings thus suggest a richer interpretation of organizational form than provided by previous researchers.

## 7. Profitability and Marketability of the Top 55 U.S. Commercial Banks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1999
### Abstract:
Utilizing recent developments in data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper examines the performance of the top 55 U.S. commercial banks via a two-stage production process that separates profitability and marketability. Substantial performance inefficiency is uncovered in both dimensions. Relatively large banks exhibit better performance on profitability, whereas smaller banks tend to perform better with respect to marketability. New context-dependent performance measures are defined for profitability and marketability which employ a DEA stratification model and a DEA attractiveness measure. When combined with the original DEA measure, the context-dependent performance measure better characterizes the profitability and marketability of 55 U.S. commercial banks. The new approach identifies areas for improved bank performance over the two-stage production process. The effect of acquisition on efficiency and attractiveness is also examined.
