### Abstract:
This study examines the impact of product variety on automobile assembly plant performance using data from GM's Wilmington, Delaware plant, together with simulation analyses of a more general auto assembly line. We extend prior product variety studies by providing evidence on the magnitude of variety-related production losses, the mechanisms through which variety impacts performance, and the effects of option bundling and labor staffing policies on the costs of product variety. The empirical analyses indicate that greater day-to-day variability in option content (but not mean option content per car) has a significant adverse impact on total labor hours per car produced, overhead hours per car produced, assembly line downtime, minor repair and major rework, and inventory levels, but does not have a significant short-run impact on total direct labor hours. However, workstations with higher variability in option content have greater slack direct labor resources to buffer against process time variation, introducing an additional cost of product variety. The simulation results support these findings in that once each workstation is optimally buffered against process time variation, product variety has an insignificant impact on direct assembly labor. The simulations also show that bundling options can reduce the amount of buffer capacity required, and that random variation is more pernicious to productivity than product variety, supporting the efforts of some auto makers to aggressively attack the causes of random variation.

## 2. Performance Evaluation of General and Company Specific Models in Software Development Effort Estimation

### Abstract:
In this paper we present the results of our effort estimation analysis of a European Space Agency database consisting of 108 software development projects. We develop and evaluate simple empirical effort estimation models that include only those productivity factors found to be significant for these projects and determine if models based on a multicompany database can be successfully used to make effort estimations within a specific company. This was accomplished by developing company specific effort estimation models based on the significant productivity factors of a particular company and by comparing the results with those from general ESA models on a holdout sample of the company. To our knowledge, no other published research has yet developed and analysed software development effort estimation models in this way. Effort predictions made on a holdout sample of the individual company's projects using general models were less accurate than the company specific model. However, it is likely that in the absence of enough resources and data for a company to develop its own model, the application of general models may be more accurate than the use of guessing and intuition.

## 3. What Price Fairness? A Bargaining Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
Our study concerns bargaining behavior in situations where one party is in a stronger position than the other. We investigate both the tradeoff the favored party makes between pursuing his strategic advantage and giving weight to other players' concern for fairness, and the tradeoff the disadvantaged player makes between pursuing a fair outcome from a disadvantaged position and the cost of that pursuit. In particular, we hypothesize that the degree to which strategically strong players attempt to exploit their strategic advantage depends on their potential costs for doing so. Similarly, the degree to which weak players persist in seeking fairness is also a function of how much it (potentially) costs them to do so.

## 4. Evolutionary Patterns of Flexible Automation and Performance: A Longitudinal Study
### Author(s):
- Kenneth K. Boyer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
This study presents a longitudinal analysis of patterns of investment in advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT) and financial performance. Investments in AMT from 112 manufacturing plants in the metal-working industries are examined. Data were collected via a mail survey administered to 202 plants in 1994, and readministered to 112 of the same plants in 1996. This study seeks to fill a void in the area of technology management, which is comprised primarily of cross-sectional studies that do not address the dynamic nature of investments in technology. Four major conclusions are drawn from the data. First, several individual technologies have higher investments in 1996 than in 1994. In particular, electronic mail has the largest increase in investment, a finding that suggests that manufacturing firms are finding ways to take advantage of the exploding potential of electronic communication. Our second conclusion is that plants invest in technology in an incremental fashion over time rather than using an all-or-nothing approach. Plants with low investments follow one of three technology strategies as their investments in AMTs evolve: (1) continued low investment, (2) investment primarily in design-based technologies, or (3) equalized investment in design, manufacturing, and administrative AMTs. Third, analysis of the degree of manufacturing involvement in developing business strategy indicates that plants that have a more proactive role for manufacturing invest greater resources in AMTs. Finally, while AMT investment was not positively associated with performance in a cross-sectional analysis, longitudinal analysis of data collected two years later does reveal a relationship. In short, the analysis supports the proposition that there is a lag between initial investment and resulting performance improvements.

## 5. Managing Supply Chain Demand Variability with Scheduled Ordering Policies
### Author(s):
- Grard P. Cachon
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
This paper studies supply chain demand variability in a model with one supplier and Nretailers that face stochastic demand. Retailers implement scheduled ordering policies: Orders occur at fixed intervals and are equal to some multiple of a fixed batch size. A method is presented that exactly evaluates costs. Previous research demonstrates that the supplier's demand variance declines as the retailers' order intervals are balanced, i.e., the same number of retailers order each period. This research shows that the supplier's demand variance will (generally) decline as the retailers' order interval is lengthened or as their batch size is increased. Lower supplier demand variance can certainly lead to lower inventory at the supplier. This paper finds that reducing supplier demand variance with scheduled ordering policies can also lower total supply chain costs.

## 6. Dynamic Pricing for Network Service: Equilibrium and Stability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
Consider a data communication network owned and operated by a single organization. The network has an infinite number of small users and is managed by a system manager (SM) whose objective is to maximize the net value of the system as a whole. The objective of this paper is to study pricing mechanisms that induce the optimal arrival rates when the SM has no full knowledge of the demand in advance. We investigate the system behavior under three alternative dynamic pricing rules and users' expectations models, and characterize the equilibrium and its stability conditions.

## 7. Predicting Queueing Delays
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the possibility of predicting each customer's waiting time in queue before starting service in a multiserver service system with the first-come first-served service discipline, such as a telephone call center. A predicted waiting-time distribution or an appropriate summary statistic such as the mean or the 90th percentile may be communicated to the customer upon arrival and possibly thereafter in order to improve customer satisfaction. The predicted waiting-time distribution may also be used by the service provider to better manage the service system, e.g., to help decide when to add additional service agents. The possibility of making reliable predictions is enhanced by exploiting information about system state, including the number of customers in the system ahead of the current customer. Additional information beyond the number of customers in the system may be obtained by classifying customers and the service agents to which they are assigned. For nonexponential service times, the elapsed service times of customers in service can often be used to advantage to compute conditional-remaining-service-time distributions. Approximations are proposed to convert the distributions of remaining service times into the distribution of the desired customer waiting time. The analysis reveals the advantage from exploiting additional information.

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1999
### Abstract:
This paper focuses on simultaneous resource allocation, lot-sizing, and scheduling in a multimachine, deterministic ELSP environment. We consider the problem of apportioning item production to distinct manufacturing lines with different costs and capabilities (production rates). The objective is to minimize the long-run average production, setup, inventory, and shortage penalty costs (due to lost sales).
