## 1. Venture Capitalists' Assessment of New Venture Survival
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
This study investigates whether VCs' assessment policies of new venture survival are consistent with those arising from the strategy literature (using two established strategy perspectives). Strategy scholars suggest the nature of the markets, competition, and decisions made by the management team affect a new venture's survival chances. The findings demonstrate that VCs' assessment policies are predominantly consistent with those proposed by strategy scholarsproviding insight into why VCs consider certain criteria in their assessment of new venture survival as well as why some criteria are more important in their assessment than others. Through this increased understanding of venture capitalists' decision making, entrepreneurs seeking capital may be better able to address their requests for funding to those criteria venture capitalists find most critical to the survival of a new venture. Venture capitalists may use these findings to better understand their own decision making process, which, in turn, provides the opportunity to increase evaluation efficiency.

## 2. Decentralized Multi-Echelon Supply Chains: Incentives and Information
### Author(s):
- Hau Lee

### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
Consider a supply chain in which a product must pass through multiple sites located in series before it is finally delivered to outside customers. Incentive problems may arise in this system when decisions are delegated to corresponding site managers, each maximizing his/her own performance metric. From the overall system's point of view, the decentralized supply chain may not be as efficient as the centralized one. In practice, alternative performance mechanisms are often used to align the incentives of the different managers in a supply chain. This paper discusses the cost conservation, incentive compatibility, and informational decentralizability properties of these mechanisms. In particular, for a special type of supply chain, we show that a performance measurement scheme involving transfer pricing, consignment, shortage reimbursement, and an additional backlog penalty at the last downstream site satisfies all these properties.

## 3. Holistic Customer Requirements and the Design-Select Decision
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
When confronted with the task of developing a new product, a firm chooses either to design new components, unique to the product application, or to select components from those offered in the catalogs of suppliers or from those already in use in its other products. We call this the design-selectdecision. The benefits of selecting an existing component include minimizing investment, exploiting economies of scale, and preserving organizational focus. On the other hand, designing product-specific components allows a firm to (a) maximize product performance with respect to holistic customer requirementsthose requirements that arise in a complex way from most of the components of a product; (b) minimize the size and mass of a product; and (c) minimize the true variable costs of production. When these benefits exceed those from selecting existing components, firms will tend to design product-specific components. Our approach is to develop this theory by linking concepts from marketing, technological innovation, and engineering design. This theory yields four testable hypotheses. A cross-sectional analysis of 225 products finds substantial support for the theory.

## 4. Information Aggregation and Communication in Organizations
### Author(s):
- Philippe Jehiel
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
Operating units must communicate their private information regarding decisions to be taken in organizations. This paper characterizes the optimal communication structures assuming that (i) a decision maker is fired whenever he makes a decision that proves wrong ex post relative to the status quo; and (ii) direct communication in a group of kunits may result in the loss of messages with a probability that solely depends on the group size. Several levels of partitioning with direct communication taking place in each group are required. It is shown that there exists a group size that allows communication technology to be exploited optimally: The optimal communication structure is such that it is essentially composed of groups of this size only at every level of partitioning.

## 5. Real Options and Product Life Cycles
### Author(s):
- Nicolas P. B. Bollen
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
In this paper, I develop an option valuation framework that explicitly incorporates a product life cycle. I then use the framework to value the real option to change a project's capacity. Standard techniques for valuing real options typically ignore product life cycle models and specify instead a constant expected growth rate for demand or price. I show that this specification can lead to significant error in the valuation of capacity options. In particular, the standard technique tends to undervalue the option to contract capacity and overvalue the option to expand capacity. This result has important implications for capital investment decisions, especially in high-technology industries that feature regular introductions of newly improved products.

## 6. Capacity Allocation Using Past Sales: When to Turn-and-Earn
### Author(s):
- Grard P. Cachon
- Martin A. Lariviere
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
Consider a supplier selling to multiple retailers. Demand varies across periods, but the supplier's capacity and wholesale price are fixed. If demand is high, the retailers' needs exceed capacity, and the supplier must implement an allocation mechanism to dole out production. We examine how the choice of mechanism impacts retailer actions and supply chain performance. In particular, we analyze turn-and-earn allocation, a method commonly used in the automobile industry. This scheme bases current allocations on past sales and thus enables retailers to influence their future allocations; they compete for scarce capacity even if they do not compete for customers.

## 7. The Effects of Human Resource Management Systems on Economic Performance: An International Comparison of U.S. and Japanese Plants
### Author(s):
- Casey Ichniowski
- Kathryn Shaw
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
This study uses personally collected data from 41 steel production lines to assess the effects of Japanese and U.S. human resource management (HRM) practices on worker productivity. The Japanese production lines employ a common system of HRM practices including: problem-solving teams, extensive orientation, training throughout employees' careers, extensive information sharing, rotation across jobs, employment security, and profit sharing. A majority of U.S. plants now have one or two features of this system of HRM practices, but only a minority have a comprehensive system of innovative work practices that parallels the full system of practices found among the Japanese manufacturers.

## 8. Cross-Utilization of Workers Whose Capabilities Differ
### Author(s):
- Gerard M. Campbell
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model for allocating cross-trained workers at the beginning of a shift in a multidepartment service environment. It assumes departments are trying to maximize objective functions that are concave with respect to the number of workers assigned. Worker capabilities are described by parameters that range from zero to one, with fractional values representing workers who are less than fully qualified. The nonlinear programming model presented is a variant of the generalized assignment problem.

## 9. Inventory Control in Hybrid Systems with Remanufacturing
### Author(s):
- Erwin van der Laan

- Luk Van Wassenhove
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
This paper is on production planning and inventory control in systems where manufacturing and remanufacturing operations occur simultaneously. Typical for these hybridsystems is, that both the output of the manufacturing process and the output of the remanufacturing process can be used to fulfill customer demands. Here, we consider a relatively simple hybrid system, related to a single component durable product. For this system, we present a methodology to analyse a PUSH control strategy (in which all returned products are remanufactured as early as possible) and a PULL control strategy (in which all returned products are remanufactured as late as is convenient). The main contributions of this paper are (i) to compare traditional systems without remanufacturing to PUSH and to PULL controlled systems with remanufacturing, and (ii) to derive managerial insights into the inventory related effects of remanufacturing.

## 10. A Simulated Annealing Algorithm with Constant Temperature for Discrete Stochastic Optimization
### Author(s):
- Mahmoud H. Alrefaei
- Sigrn Andradttir
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
We present a modification of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems. Like the original simulated annealing algorithm, our method has the hill climbing feature, so it can find global optimal solutions to discrete stochastic optimization problems with many local solutions. However, our method differs from the original simulated annealing algorithm in that it uses a constant (rather than decreasing) temperature. We consider two approaches for estimating the optimal solution. The first approach uses the number of visits the algorithm makes to the different states (divided by a normalizer) to estimate the optimal solution. The second approach uses the state that has the best average estimated objective function value as estimate of the optimal solution. We show that both variants of our method are guaranteed to converge almost surely to the set of global optimal solutions, and discuss how our work applies in the discrete deterministic optimization setting. We also show how both variants can be applied for solving discrete optimization problems when the objective function values are estimated using either transient or steady-state simulation. Finally, we include some encouraging numerical results documenting the behavior of the two variants of our algorithm when applied for solving two versions of a particular discrete stochastic optimization problem, and compare their performance with that of other variants of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems.

## 12. Remarks on: Some Extensions of the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Scott Webster
### Published:
- 1 May 1999
### Abstract:
Computational complexity results provide guideposts toward fruitful directions in algorithmic research and therefore play an important role in research on algorithm design. This note discusses complexity analysis in the context of lotsizing and scheduling problems. Such discussion is warranted for three reasons. First, research on problems that combine lotsizing and scheduling is growing rapidly. Second, these problems have the potential for requiring much less information to represent an instance than to represent a candidate solution. As a consequence, analysis may depend critically on subtle considerations relating to instance and solution size. Third, as we will see below, there is some evidence that the literature is unclear on this point.
