### Abstract:
Product variety in many industries has increased steadily throughout this century. Component sharingusing the same version of a component across multiple productsis increasingly viewed by companies as a way to offer high variety in the marketplace while retaining low variety in their operations. Yet, despite the popularity of component sharing in industry, little is known about how to design an effective component-sharing strategy or about the factors that influence the success of such a strategy. In this paper we critically examine component sharing using automotive front brakes as an example. We consider three basic questions: (1) What are the key drivers and trade-offs of component-sharing decisions? (2) How much variation exists in actual component-sharing practice? and (3) How can this variation be explained? To answer these questions, we develop an analytic model of component sharing and show through empirical testing that this model explains much of the variation in sharing practice for automotive braking systems. We find that the optimal number of brake rotors is a function of the range of vehicle weights, sales volume, fixed component design and tooling costs, variable costs, and the variation in production volume across the models of the product line. We conclude with a discussion of the general managerial implications of our findings.

## 2. Evaluating Financial Risk in the Medicare Prospective Payment System
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) is analogous to an insurance scheme in which financial risk is mitigated through experience rating. In addition, risk is also mitigated through reinsurance provisions. Although a provider may not want this reinsurance, participation is mandatory. We develop a framework for evaluating financial risk under the PPS. We use this framework to examine optional reinsurance as an alternative risk mitigation mechanism. We illustrate an application of optional reinsurance using data for Medicare psychiatric inpatient services. Our analysis indicates that viable schemes exist for implementing optional reinsurance as a prospective payment option.

## 3. Optimizing a Ring-Based Private Line Telecommunication Network Using Tabu Search
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
One of the private line network design problems in the telecommunications industry is to interconnect a set of customer locations through a ring of end offices so as to minimize the total tariff cost and provide reliability. We develop a Tabu Search method for the problem that incorporates long term memory, probabilistic move selections, hierarchical move evaluation, candidate list strategies and an elite solution recovery strategy. Computational results for test data show that the Tabu Search heuristic finds optimal solutions for all test problems that can be solved exactly by a branch-and-cut algorithm, while running about three orders of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm. In addition, for larger size problems that cannot be solved exactly, the tabu search algorithm outperforms the best local search heuristic currently available. The performance gap favoring Tabu Search increases significantly for more difficult problem instances.

## 4. Stalking Information: Bayesian Inventory Management with Unobserved Lost Sales
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
Retailers are frequently uncertain about the underlying demand distribution of a new product. When taking the empirical Bayesian approach of Scarf (1959), they simultaneously stock the product over time and learn about the distribution. Assuming that unmet demand is lost and unobserved, this learning must be based on observing sales rather than demand, which differs from sales in the event of a stockout. Using the framework and results of Braden and Freimer (1991), the cumulative learning about the underlying demand distribution is captured by two parameters, a scale parameter that reflects the predicted size of the underlying market, and a shape parameter that indicates both the size of the market and the precision with which the underlying distribution is known. An important simplification result of Scarf (1960) and Azoury (1985), which allows the scale parameter to be removed from the optimization, is shown to extend to this setting. We present examples that reveal two interesting phenomena: (1) A retailer may hope that, compared to stocking out, realized demand will be strictly less than the stock level, even though stocking out would signal a stochastically larger demand distribution, and (2) it can be optimal to drop a product after a period of successful sales. We also present specific conditions under which the following results hold: (1) Investment in excess stocks to enhance learning will occur in every dynamic problem, and (2) a product is never dropped after a period of poor sales. The model is extended to multiple independent markets whose distributions depend proportionately on a single unknown parameter. We argue that smaller markets should be given better service as an effective means of acquiring information.

## 5. Risk Aversion or Myopia? Choices in Repeated Gambles and Retirement Investments
### Author(s):
- Shlomo Benartzi
- Richard H. Thaler
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
We study how decision makers choose when faced with multiple plays of a gamble or investment. When evaluating multiple plays of a simple mixed gamble, a chance to win x or lose y, subjects show a sensitivity to the amount to lose on a single trial, holding the distribution of returns for the portfolio constant; that is, they display myopic loss aversion. Many subjects who decline multiple plays of such a gamble will accept it when shown the resulting distribution. This analysis is applied to the problem of retirement investing. We show that workers invest more of their retirement savings in stocks if they are shown long-term (rather than one-year) rates of return.

## 6. A Parallel Approach Path to Estimating Collision Risk During Simultaneous Landings
### Author(s):
- Arnold Barnett
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
Airport capacity could increase if, even during inclement weather, independent landings could occur on parallel runways only about half a mile apart. A key question about such operations is whether the collision risk they entail is acceptably low. Pursuing that issue, we explore a method for estimating the chance that a plane on final approach during instrument flight conditions will blunder in a way that could imperil nearby aircraft. We argue that the method could yield an attractive combination of high estimation accuracy and relatively low cost.

## 7. Efficient Design and Sensitivity Analysis of Control Charts Using Monte Carlo Simulation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
The design of control charts in statistical quality control addresses the optimal selection of the design parameters (such as the sampling frequency and the control limits) and includes sensitivity analysis with respect to system parameters (such as the various process parameters and the economic costs of sampling). The advent of more complicated control chart schemes has necessitated the use of Monte Carlo simulation in the design process, especially in the evaluation of performance measures such as average run length. In this paper, we apply two gradient estimation proceduresperturbation analysis and the likelihood ratio/score function methodto derive estimators that can be used in gradient-based optimization algorithms and in sensitivity analysis when Monte Carlo simulation is employed. We illustrate the techniques on a general control chart that includes the Shewhart chart and the exponentially-weighted moving average chart as special cases. Simulation examples comparing the estimators with each other and with brute force finite differences demonstrate the possibility of significant variance reduction in settings of practical interest.

- David Pisinger
- Paolo Toth
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
Two new algorithms recently proved to outperform all previous methods for the exact solution of the 0-1 Knapsack Problem. This paper presents a combination of such approaches, where, in addition, valid inequalities are generated and surrogate relaxed, and a new initial core problem is adopted. The algorithm is able to solve all classical test instances, with up to 10,000 variables, in less than 0.2 seconds on a HP9000-735/99 computer. The C language implementation of the algorithm is available on the internet.

### Abstract:
This paper describes a novel theoretical and empirical approach to tasks such as business process redesign and knowledge management. The project involves collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes, and organizing these examples in an on-line process handbook. The handbook is intended to help people: (1) redesign existing organizational processes, (2) invent new organizational processes (especially ones that take advantage of information technology), and (3) share ideas about organizational practices.

## 10. A Multiserver Queueing System with Impatient Customers
### Author(s):
- Nam Kyoo Boots
- Henk Tijms
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
Many real-world situations involve queueing systems in which customers wait for service for a limited time only and leave the system if service has not begun within that time. This paper considers a multiserver queueing system with impatient customers, where the customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service requirements have a general distribution. A simple and insightful solution is presented for the loss probability. The solution is exact for exponential services and is an excellent heuristic for general service times.

## 11. Optimality of the Symmetric Workload Allocation in a Single-Server Flow Line System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1999
### Abstract:
This paper provides a proof of the symmetrical allocation property (SAP), conjectured in an earlier work on the workload allocation problem for a manufacturing flow line system. The system consists of N single-Erlang servers in series having a common interstation buffer capacity. SAP says a symmetric workload allocation exists among the optimal solutions. We first show the reciprocal of the throughput is increasing and jointly convex, not component-wisely, in workloads. Then we apply the line reversibility property to obtain an alternative optimal allocation symmetric for any optimal workload allocation that is asymmetric. A sufficient condition for SAP to hold is also given, which relaxes the hypothesizing assumptions on the service-time distribution and interstation buffer capacities.
