## 1. Measuring the Effectiveness of Overlapping Development Activities

### Abstract:
Overlapping development activities is widely used to reduce project completion times in product development. However, research on the applicability of the concept in different technological environments remains scarce. So far, very few industry-specific studies have statistically confirmed an accelerating effect of overlap. In the present article we statistically measure the effectiveness of overlapping development activities in reducing project completion time. Building on analytical research in operations management, we argue that this effectiveness differs with the organization's capability to resolve uncertainty early in the process. Projects benefit more from overlap if they are able to resolve uncertainty early. This contingency view to overlapping development activities is tested based on data from 140 completed development projects across several global electronics industries.

## 2. Inventory Reduction and Productivity Growth: Linkages in the Japanese Automotive Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
The literature on JIT production suggests a causal link between work-in-process inventory and manufacturing productivity. Such a connection has been described in numerous case studies but never tested statistically. This paper uses historical data for 52 Japanese automotive companies to evaluate the inventory-productivity relationship. We find that firms increased their productivity rank during periods of substantial inventory reduction. More detailed tests suggest that inventory reductions stimulated gains in productivity: On average, each 10% reduction in inventory led to about a 1% gain in labor productivity, with a lag of about one year. Such effects were more immediate for Toyota affiliates, but undetectable for close suppliers of Nissan. These findings imply that inventory reduction served as an important driver of process improvement for many Japanese automotive companies, although some firms emphasized other methods.

## 3. Variety Seeking, Purchase Timing, and the Lightning Bolt Brand Choice Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
The Lightning Bolt (LB) model provides a comprehensive framework for accommodating the effects of habit persistence, unobserved heterogeneity, and state dependence on household brand choice behavior. This paper presents a discrete, dynamic brand-choice model that belongs to the LB class of models. We propose a method for incorporating the effects of variety seeking into the LB model formulation. The proposed formulation explicitly links brand choice and purchase timing behavior via the effect of state dependence. This state-dependence based linkage between brand choice and purchase timing comes about due to the attribute satiation notion associated with household variety seeking behavior. Empirical implementation of the model specification requires recognizing that interpurchase times, like brand choices, also depend upon marketing variables and household characteristics. A hazard model is specified to capture this relationship.

### Abstract:
Diagnosing the nature and magnitude of competitive interactions among firms is important for developing effective marketing strategies. In this paper, we formulate a game-theoretic model of firm interaction to analyze the dynamic price and advertising competition among firms in a given product market. Firm (or brand) level demand functions account for the contemporaneous and carry-over effects of these marketing activities, and also allow for the effects of competitor actions. Firms take into consideration the actions of their rivals, as well as their own demand and cost functions (both production and advertising) when determining the profit-maximizing price and advertising levels. Our formulation enables us to quantify not only the direction and magnitude of competitive reactions, but also to identify the underlying form of market conduct that generates the particular pattern of interaction. We specify and estimate a fully structural econometric model for three firms constituting a distinct sub-market within a personal-care product category. We estimate the demand and competitive interaction parameters, as well as the production and advertising cost functions for each firm. We then derive implications for competitive interactions and market structure. Interestingly, we find that while firms seem to compete on advertising, they price cooperatively, thereby enhancing their price-cost margins.

## 5. Measures of Perceived Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
Based on our previous work on the standard measure of risk, this paper presents two classes of measures for perceived risk by decomposing a lottery into its mean and standard risk. One of the classes of our risk measures presumes that there is no risk when there is no uncertainty involved, and the other allows different degenerate lotteries to be evaluated with different values of risk. The former has more prescriptive appeal in risky decision making, but the latter may have more descriptive power for subjective risk judgments. Our risk measures can also take into account the asymmetric effects of losses and gains on perceived risk based on an appropriate choice of the standard measure of risk. The perceived risk models we propose unify a large body of empirical evidence regarding risk judgments, and provide sufficient flexibility to better capture people's perceptions of risk than previously developed risk models. In particular, our risk measures provide clear ways to accommodate financial measures of risk and psychological measures of risk, and they can be incorporated into preference models in an appealing form based on mean-risk tradeoffs.

## 6. The Value of Internet Commerce to the Customer
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Keeney
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
Internet commerce has the potential to offer customers a better deal compared to purchases by conventional methods in many situations. To make this potential a reality, businesses must focus on the values of their customers. We interviewed over one-hundred individuals about all the pros and cons of using Internet commerce that they experienced or envisioned. The results were organized into twenty-five categories of objectives that were influenced by Internet purchases. These categories were separated into means objectives and fundamental objectives used to describe the bottom line consequences of concern to customers. These results are applicable to designing an Internet commerce system for a business, creating and redesigning products, and increasing value to customers. The set of fundamental objectives also provides the foundation for developing a quantitative model of customer values.

## 7. Project Scheduling Under Partially Renewable Resource Constraints

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
We consider a generalization of the classical resource constrained project scheduling problem. We introduce so-called partially renewable resources by assuming for each resource a capacity on subsets of periods. The concept of partially renewable resources is a fundamental tool in order to make, e.g., timetabling and shift scheduling aspects, amenable to project scheduling. In addition, partially renewable resources serve to model complicated labor regulations. Furthermore, they cover traditional renewable and nonrenewable resource constraints as special cases.

## 8. Solving Semi-Markov Decision Problems Using Average Reward Reinforcement Learning
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
A large class of problems of sequential decision making under uncertainty, of which the underlying probability structure is a Markov process, can be modeled as stochastic dynamic programs (referred to, in general, as Markov decision problems or MDPs). However, the computational complexity of the classical MDP algorithms, such as value iteration and policy iteration, is prohibitive and can grow intractably with the size of the problem and its related data. Furthermore, these techniques require for each action the one step transition probability and reward matrices, and obtaining these is often unrealistic for large and complex systems. Recently, there has been much interest in a simulation-based stochastic approximation framework called reinforcement learning (RL), for computing near optimal policies for MDPs. RL has been successfully applied to very large problems, such as elevator scheduling, and dynamic channel allocation of cellular telephone systems.

## 9. Batch Construction Heuristics and Storage Assignment Strategies for Walk/Ride and Pick Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
The retrieval of items from storage is a chore faced by virtually every business concern. Walk/ride and pick systems are a popular method for performing this chore in many applications. When retrieval requests consist of multiple items, order pickers must travel to numerous storage locations to complete each order. When these requests are made in sufficient volume, a method of order retrieval known as batch picking is often used. Batch picking is a popular approach in the mail-order industry and is employed in industrial settings such as tool cribs and in warehouses, which service assembly line operations.

## 10. IDEA and AR-IDEA: Models for Dealing with Imprecise Data in DEA
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric approach to evaluating the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) that use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. An assumption underlying DEA is that all the data assume the form of specific numerical values. In some applications, however, the data may be imprecise. For instance, some of the data may be known only within specified bounds, while other data may be known only in terms of ordinal relations. DEA with imprecise data or, more compactly, the Imprecise Data Envelopment Analysis (IDEA) method developed in this paper permits mixtures of imprecisely- and exactly-known data, which the IDEA models transform into ordinary linear programming forms. This is carried even further in the present paper to comprehend the now extensively employed Assurance Region (AR) concepts in which bounds are placed on the variables rather than the data. We refer to this approach as AR-IDEA, because it replaces conditions on the variables with transformations of the data and thus also aligns the developments we describe in this paper with what are known as cone-ratio envelopments in DEA. As a result, one unified approach, referred to as the AR-IDEA model, is achieved which includes not only imprecise data capabilities but also assurance region and cone-ratio envelopment concepts.

## 11. Anticipating the Consequences of School Reform: A New Use of DEA
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1999
### Abstract:
We use DEA-type linear programming techniques to simulate a basic component of educational reform-eliminating restrictions on the allocation of school personnel. Our technique allows us to identify potential output gains (or equivalently potential cost savings) from reform. We can also identify which personnel groups are likely to gain and lose under this reform. When we apply our model to a sample of Texas school districts, we find evidence that the educational establishment has substantial economic rents to protect from school reform, and that the primary beneficiaries of reform are likely to be affluent school districts with few minority students. The technique, which relies on the relationship between the direct and indirect distance functions, can be easily generalized to measure the potential gains from removing other input restrictions such as union work rules, environmental regulations, or deed restrictions.
