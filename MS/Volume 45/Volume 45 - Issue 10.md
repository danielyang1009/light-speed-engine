### Abstract:
Demand uncertainty is a key concern of electric utility planners. While the greater use of short lead time technologies provides one possible way to deal with this problem, it is not clear how they are best deployed. The approach taken in this paper is to examine a capacity mix model that explicitly accounts for differences in technology lead times. Key results that are obtained include the characterization of the optimal solution and the development of a new set of technology screening criteria. In practice, the lead time order (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending length of lead time) is typically the inverse of the so-called merit order (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending operating cost). We show that for this case, the optimal solution may be determined with relative ease. A numerical example demonstrates that some short lead time technologies screened out by standard planning methods may enter the optimal solution when differences in lead time are considered, while some long lead time technologies may leave. In addition, the optimal expected level of reliability may be greater.

## 2. Fast Approximation Methods for Sales Force Deployment
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Sales force deployment involves the simultaneous resolution of four interrelated subproblems: sales force sizing, salesman location, sales territory alignment, and sales resource allocation. The first subproblem deals with selecting the appropriate number of salesman. The salesman location aspect of the problem involves determining the location of each salesman in one sales coverage unit. Sales territory alignment may be viewed as the problem of grouping sales coverage units into larger geographic clusters called sales territories. Sales resource allocation refers to the problem of allocating scarce salesman time to the aligned sales coverage units. All four subproblems have to be resolved in order to maximize profit of the selling organization. In this paper a novel nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is formulated which covers all four subproblems simultaneously. For the solution of the model we present approximation methods capable of solving large-scale, real-world instances. The methods, which provide lower bounds for the optimal objective function value, are benchmarked against upper bounds. On average the solution gap, i.e., the difference between upper and lower bounds, is about 3%. Furthermore, we show how the methods can be used to analyze various problem settings of practical relevance. Finally, an application in the beverage industry is presented.

## 3. Endogeneity in Brand Choice Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
Applications of random utility models to scanner data have been widely presented in marketing for the last 20 years. One particular problem with these applications is that they have ignored possible correlations between the independent variables in the deterministic component of utility (price, promotion, etc.) and the stochastic component or error term. In fact, marketing-mix variables, such as price, not only affect brand purchasing probabilities but are themselves endogenously set by marketing managers. This work tests whether these endogeneity problems are important enough to warrant consideration when estimating random utility models with scanner panel data. Our results show that not accounting for endogeneity may result in a substantial bias in the parameter estimates.

## 4. The Quantity Flexibility Contract and Supplier-Customer Incentives
### Author(s):
- Andy A. Tsay
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
Consider a supply chain consisting of two independent agents, a supplier (e.g., a manufacturer) and its customer (e.g., a retailer), the latter in turn serving an uncertain market demand. To reconcile manufacturing/procurement time lags with a need for timely response to the market, such supply chains often must commit resources to production quantities based on forecasted rather than realized demand.

## 5. Dynamic R&D Investment Policies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
This paper examines dynamic R&D investment policies and the valuation of R&D programs in a contingent claims framework. We incorporate the following characteristics of R&D programs into our model: learning-by-doing, collateral learning between different projects in the program, interaction between project cash flows, periodic reevaluations of the program, different intensities of investment, capital rationing constraints, and competition. We show that a firm may invest in multiple projects even if only one can be implemented after development is complete. Furthermore, the firm may significantly alter its funding policy over time. For example, it may simultaneously develop multiple projects for a period of time, then focus on a lead project, and potentially resume funding of a backup project if the lead project fails to deliver on its early promise. We show how a firm can forecast expected R&D spending through time for an optimally executed R&D program. While project volatility plays an important role in determining R&D program value, we find that for high volatility projects the optimal investment policy is not very sensitive to changes in (or misestimation of) volatility. In considering whether to accelerate development of a project, a firm should balance the adverse effects of increased costs and the loss of investment flexibility against the positive effects of rapid uncertainty resolution and accelerated cash flows. In the presence of a budget constraint that prevents the firm from simultaneously accelerating projects and developing projects in parallel, we find that, if one project significantly dominates another early in the development stage, the option to accelerate the lead project is likely to be more valuable than the option to exchange projects. Thus, the backup project would be shelved in order to commit extra resources to development of the lead project. Finally, competition from other firms leads to more parallel investment in the early development stages of projects, less parallel investment in the latter stages of development, and lower overall investment.

## 6. Flexible and Risk-Sharing Supply Contracts Under Price Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
We study supply contracts for deterministic demand but in an environment of uncertain prices. We develop valuation methodologies for different types of supply contracts. A time-inflexible contract requires the firm to specify not only how many units it will purchase, but also the timing of the purchase. A time-flexible contract allows the firm to specify the purchase amount over a given period of time without specifying the exact time of purchase. Other than time flexibility, the suppliers may offer quantity flexibility to the firm as well, i.e., purchase quantities could be within a prespecified quantity window. Finally, risk-sharing features can be incorporated in the contract in terms of the purchase price that the firm eventually pays to a supplier. Within a prespecified price window the firm pays the realized price, but outside of it the firm shares, in an agreed way, added costs or benefits.

## 7. A General Additive Data Perturbation Method for Database Security

### Abstract:
The security of organizational databases has received considerable attention in the literature in recent years. This can be attributed to a simultaneous increase in the amount of data being stored in databases, the analysis of such data, and the desire to protect confidential data. Data perturbation methods are often used to protect confidential, numerical data from unauthorized queries while providing maximum access and accurate information to legitimate queries. To provide accurate information, it is desirable that perturbation does not result in a change in relationships between attributes. In the presence of nonconfidential attributes, existing methods will result in such a change. This study describes a new method (General Additive Data Perturbation) that does not change relationships between attributes. All existing methods of additive data perturbation are shown to be special cases of this method. When the database has a multivariate normal distribution, the new method provides maximum security and minimum bias. For nonnormal databases, the new method provides better security and bias performance than the multiplicative data perturbation method.

## 8. Modeling Emergency Supply Flexibility in a Two-Echelon Inventory System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
We consider a two-echelon inventory system for service parts. To obtain high service levels at a low cost we allow not only for normal supply of parts but also for emergency supply options in terms of lateral transshipments and direct deliveries. After presenting the strategy we use for satisfying customer demand, we construct an analytical model that we use to calculate relevant performance measures. Simulation shows that our model produces accurate estimates, and that the performance of the inventory system is insensitive to the lead-time distribution. After introducing a cost structure we show that the strategy we propose can result in considerable savings when compared to using only normal supply. Comparison of the results of our model with the results of other models indicates that the combined use of lateral transshipments and direct deliveries can lead to significant cost savings.

## 9. Broadly Decreasing Risk Aversion
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
This paper considers decision-making in the presence of two additive risk sources, with no restrictions on the relation between the two risks. A utility function is said to exhibit broad DARA if and only if a rise in wealth always decreases the magnitude of the risk premium for one of the risks vis-a-vis the other. A condition on utility functions giving this property is derived: utility must be of the linear plus exponential form. It is shown that certain problems involving portfolios and risk-averse firms give unambiguous comparative statics if and only if utility exhibits broad DARA.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
The minimum cost flow problem is to determine a least cost shipment of a commodity through a network G = (N, A) in order to satisfy demands at certain nodes from available supplies at other nodes. In this paper, we study a variant of the minimum cost flow problem where we are given a set R  A of arcs and require that each arc in R must carry the same amount of flow. This problem, which we call the simple equal flow problem, arose while modeling a water resource system management in Sardinia, Italy. We consider the simple equal flow problem in a directed network with n nodes, m arcs, and where all arc capacities and node supplies are integer and bounded by U. We develop several algorithms for the simple equal flow problemthe network simplex algorithm, the parametric simplex algorithm, the combinatorial parametric algorithm, the binary search algorithm, and the capacity scaling algorithm. The binary search algorithm solves the simple equal flow problem in O(log(nU)) applications of any minimum cost flow algorithm. The capacity scaling algorithm solves it in O(m(m + n logn) log (nU)) time, which is almost the same time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem by the capacity scaling algorithm. These algorithms can be easily modified to obtain an integer solution of the simple equal flow problem.

## 11. Note: Optimal Ordering Decisions with Uncertain Cost and Demand Forecast Updating
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1999
### Abstract:
We determine the optimal ordering policy for a retailer who has two instants to order a seasonal product from a manufacturer prior to a single selling season. While the demand is uncertain, the retailer can improve the forecast by utilizing the market signals observed between the first and second instants. However, because of the nature of the manufacturing environment, the unit cost at the second instant is uncertain and could be higher (or lower) than the unit cost at the first instant. To determine the profit-maximizing ordering strategies at both instants, the retailer has to evaluate the trade-off between a more accurate forecast and a potentially higher unit cost at the second instant. We present a nested newsvendor model for determining the optimal order quantity at each instant and characterize the conditions under which it is optimal for the retailer to delay its order until the second instant.
