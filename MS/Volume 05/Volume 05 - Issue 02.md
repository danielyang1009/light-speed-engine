## 1. The Application of Linear Programming to Team Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- Roy Radner
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
In a team decision problem there are two or more decision variables, and these different decisions can be made to depend upon different aspects of the environment, or information variables, the resulting payoff being a random variable. The choice of optimal rules for selecting information variables and for making decisions is the central problem of the economic theory of teams. This paper shows, by means of an example, how linear programming can be applied to obtain optimal team decision functions in the case in which the payoff to the team is a convex polyhedral function of the decision variables.

## 2. Game Theory and Cumulative Voting for Corporate Directors
### Author(s):
- Gerald J. Glasser
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
Game theory may be used to describe and to analyze corporate elections which are based upon a system of cumulative voting. In these games a strategy is a partition of one's votes among a slate of candidates. A minimax strategy is such a partition which guarantees a voter a certain security level in terms of the number of directorships he can win irrespective of how his opponents vote. These minimax strategies, although not so called, are equivalent to decision rules on how to vote found throughout the literature of business organization.

## 3. On Inventory, Production and Employment Scheduling
### Author(s):
- A. Schild
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
The paper extends results of Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon in scheduling over time to minimize costs. It studies generalizations of the cost function which are possible without spoiling the essential simplicity of the decision rules. This is illustrated by a costing model which includes: (a) inventories of individual products, (b) a more realistic treatment of set-up costs, (c) an interest factor to discount future costs, and (d) the cost of additional temporary storage when inventory is high.

## 4. Welfare Pricing and Transport Costs
### Author(s):
- D. G. Tyndall
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
This paper attacks the problem of setting prices and outputs in a set of plants producing a given commodity but having differing cost-output functions, where producing and consuming locations are separated geographically so that transport cost in some (or all) cases are significantly greater than zero. We seek an optimal allocation of resources within the framework of orthodox welfare assumptions. Where Marginal Cost functions are non-decreasing, optimality is achieved at the classical competitive equilibrium point. Our problem is to determine this point. Given cost and demand functions of simple types, a solution can be obtained by programming methods, e.g., the Simplex method. However, where the number of significant producing and consuming locations is small, a simple iterative procedure can be applied even though the cost and demand functions be quite complex.

## 5. Scheduling the Use of Water Power
### Author(s):
- John Gessford
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
A particular type of inventory model, a hydroelectric model, with a linear cost structure is studied. The form of the optimal water utilization policy for a hydroelectric installation (at which the assumptions of the model are satisfied) is described. The nature of the optimal policy if the cost function is convex is indicated. The optimal policy if future river flow is known is also indicated.

## 6. A Model for Personnel Recruiting and Selection
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Kao
- Thomas C. Rowan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
This paper presents a mathematical model for determining a minimum cost strategy for the following personnel recruiting and selection situation. A quota is set for the minimum number of good employees to be added each period, and selection is done on the basis of a test having a known correlation with the given criterion of job success. There is a total cost for all individuals recruited and a loss attached to each person hired who turns out to be unsatisfactory. The problem is to determine a minimum acceptable score on the selection test and the number of persons to be recruited which will yield a minimum cost, including loss, as well as satisfy the prescribed quota at a given probability level.

## 7. Discussion—A Note on the Asymptotic Behavior of an Optimal Procurement Policy
### Author(s):
- Edwin S. Mills
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1959
### Abstract:
Considerable attention in recent years has been devoted to the problem of meeting known demands or requirements over some finite number of planning periods at minimum cost. Representative of these problems is a problem that was first solved in the fundamental paper by Modigliani and Hohn [Modigliani, F., F. E. Hohn. 1955. Production planning over time and the nature of the expectation and planning horizon. Econometrica23 46–66.] (referred to as M-H). No new solutions to this problem are presented in this note. Rather the procedure is to utilize the results of the M-H paper and to investigate the behavior of the decision rule through time in a very special case which seems to be of considerable practical importance.

## 9. Letter to the Editor
### Author(s):
### Published:

### Abstract:
I should like to take exception with Mr. Melvin L. Greenhut's statement that “both Weinwurm and Flood are correct” (“Mathematics, Realism and Management Science” by Melvin L. Greenhut, Management Science, April 1958, p. 315). There is no intention to reopen the discussion about the merits or demerits of our individual position; I merely wish to keep the record straight.
