## 1. The Simulation of a Large-Scale Military Activity
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
This paper was originally given at the Fifth International Meeting of the Institute of Management Sciences. It describes the first experiment of the RAND Logistics Systems Laboratory, which was concerned with testing a series of logistics policies in a detailed man-machine simulation. The paper describes the policies, the elements simulated, the operation of the experiment, and its results. It also briefly mentions the second or current experiment of the Laboratory.

## 2. Rational Systems and Logics of Action: The Factory Situation
### Author(s):
- Adam Abruzzi
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
The field of management science has reached a stage of development where it can profit from the enriched collection of empirical information currently available about factory problems. This information can be useful in the process of constructing a unified theory of management science. It can also be useful by showing to what extent rational models need to be elaborated for an optimum result in applications.

## 3. Graph Theoretic Methods in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Frank Harary
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the potential utility of graph theoretical methods for the management sciences. In a series of joint papers (16, 17, 18,19, 20) with I. C. Ross, we have combined a graph theoretical approach with matrix theory and set theory to handle problems concerning redundancies, liaison persons, cliques, and strengthening and weakening members of a group. The correspondence between these organizational concepts and ideas from graph theory (to be explained below) is as follows. A redundancy is analogous to a directed path which passes through the same point more than once. A liaison person in an organization has the role of a cut point of a connected graph. A clique is taken as a maximal complete subgraph. A strengthening member of a group is one whose presence causes the graph of a group to be more highly connected that the graph obtained when he is absent.

## 4. Competitive Coefficients
### Author(s):
- Lawrence Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
The value relationships among the competitors in a competitive situation are described by means of competitive coefficients. The competitive coefficient defines the indirect gain or loss to a competitor as a result of losses or gains by the other competitors. An example is given to illustrate the use of the coefficients in a game situation.

## 5. Production Lines and Internal Storage—A Review
### Author(s):
- Ernest Koenigsberg
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
An analysis and review of the basic problems associated with the efficient operation of production and assembly lines, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal storage. Three basic approaches are discussed:
loss transfer (fractions of losses due to stoppage are transferred to succeeding stages)
stochastic (distribution of durations of working and down states of each stage leading to determination of state probabilities)
queue (treating production lines or queue systems with limitations on size of queue between stages)
The concept of the cyclic queue is reviewed and discussed in production line terms (i.e., following a frame or jig through its cycles). The approaches are compared and industrial illustrations are given. The methods discussed apply to problems which, in physical appearance, are different from production lines; among these are chemical production, overhaul and repair systems, etc. A review of the field indicates that considerably more research and analysis is required.

## 6. The Use of an Economic Lot Range in Scheduling Production
### Author(s):
- Morris J. Solomon
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
Conventional production scheduling makes use of a minimum cost production quantity. Since cost is relatively insensitive to the production quantity within some range of the minimum cost production quantity, substantial freedom of action can be given the production scheduler provided he stays within some defined range. This paper presents two approaches to defining such a range. One approach involves little computation but can be applied only to the simplest type of cost function. The other approach can be applied to any cost function, but is more difficult to compute. With either approach, precomputed tables can simplify the scheduling process on a near-optimum basis.

## 7. Some Analysis of Purchasing Policy
### Author(s):
- William T. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
Several well known purchasing policies or “buying strategies” are studied by-means of simple mathematical models. The basic properties of these policies are demonstrated under the assumption that future market prices are viewed as random variables. An optimal policy for forward buying is obtained, and strategies for dollar averaging and speculation are investigated.

## 8. A Simple Allocation Problem
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
The problem studied is that of how to allocate a fixed amount of some resource among various activities where, after a period of time, unused portions of the resource lose their value. Demand for the resource at each station is considered to be random. The problem is a special case of one usually referred to as the distribution of the effort. The question of determining the optimal amount of resource is also discussed.

## 9. A Note on Manufacturers' Choice of Distribution Channels
### Author(s):
- Roland Artle
- Sture Berglund
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1959
### Abstract:
Many marketing problems are usually analysed in verbal terms only. For instance, different alternatives as regards the marketing routes, or channels, through which goods and services or their titles flow, are mostly considered in terms of “advantages” and “disadvantages”. Recently, however, techniques aiming at quantification—such as linear programming and search theory—have been gaining favor. This essay purports to clarify, in quantitative terms, some of the considerations that may underlie a manufacturer's choice of distribution channels. We shall limit ourselves to a comparison of two alternatives, namely selling through wholesalers and selling directly to retailers.
