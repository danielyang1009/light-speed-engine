## 1. Planning Business Progress
### Author(s):
- Melvin E. Salveson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
A study of the patterns underlying business profits and progress was touched off by loss of market position and profit. The problem was to discover patterns in our technologically advanced economy which would give top management a new basis for planning profit. Useful insights were gained, particularly on the acceleration in idea production and productivity and on the character of the innovation cycle and its relation to employment, investment, and profitability. A model is built which corrects certain errors in Parkinson's law and Keynes theory.

## 2. Long-Range Planning—Challenge to Management Science
### Author(s):
- Peter F. Drucker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
This paper attempts to define long-range planning as the organized process of making entrepreneurial decisions. It tries to answer three questions asked by managers and management scientists when they hear the phrase “long-range planning”: What long-range planning is and what it is not; why it is needed; and what is needed to do long-range planning. The paper concludes with a brief statement why long-range planning can be considered a major opportunity for, and challenge to, Management Science.

## 3. The Systems Research Laboratory's Air Defense Experiments
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Chapman
- John L. Kennedy
- Allen Newell
- William C. Biel
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
The “off-the-top” findings of the air-defense experiments conducted in RAND's Systems Research Laboratory between 1952 and 1954 were the training principles that are the basis of the system training program being implemented by the System Development Corporation.

## 4. Information Flow and Worker Productivity
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Goldman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
In this paper we are concerned with the design of an organization in the internal decision-making area. Our problem is to develop an effective system of communication and control. Effectiveness (the “pay-off”) will be measured in terms of the effect of the system and organization on the productivity of labor.

## 5. LIFO and Statistical Sampling—A Case Study
### Author(s):
- H. Justin Davidson
- R. J. Monteverde
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
A growing number of case studies, describing the increasing number of applications of statistical sampling methods to accounting problems, have appeared in accounting literature. A substantial number, although not all, of these case studies have tended to emphasize the statistical aspects of the particular problem being described, at the neglect of accounting considerations. This is understandable in the sense that statistical techniques are relatively new to the accounting profession and new techniques, rather than the old, require exposition. However, the fruitful use of statistics in accounting requires full consideration of both statistical and accounting aspects of any particular problem. With this point of view, the following case study describing the statistical and accounting problems encountered in an adoption of the LIFO method of valuing inventory is presented.

## 6. Sequencing n Jobs on Two Machines with Arbitrary Time Lags
### Author(s):
- L. G. Mitten
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
Each of n jobs must be run first on machine I and then on machine I. Running times for each job on each machine are given. Also specified are arbitrary time lags which prescribe that a job may not be started (completed) on machine II until at least a certain time has elapsed since starting (completing) the job on machine I. A rule is given for determining the sequence in which jobs are to be run on the machines—using the same sequence for both machines—in order to minimize the time between the start of production of the first job on machine I and the completion of production of the last job on machine II.

## 7. Discussion: Sequencing n Jobs on Two Machines with Arbitrary Time Lags
### Author(s):
- S. M. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
This note presents an alternate proof of a result of L. G. Mitten, solving the problem of sequencing n jobs through two machines with arbitrary time lags when the job sequences are the same for both machines. The more difficult general problem is also discussed and partially solved.

## 8. On a Class of Capacitated Transportation Problems
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
Transportation models (ordinary and transhipment) having certain types of capacity constraints on the flows between origins and destinations are studied from the point of view of transforming them into enlarged standardized (non-capacitated) models. Specifically constraints on the flow from disjoint and/or nested sets of origins to all destinations, and from any single origin to disjoint and/or nested sets of destinations are considered. Dual formulations are indicated for constraints on the flow to destinations from origins. In the case of a set of capacity constraints on the flow from each origin to each destination, the models proposed are easily seen to be of minimal dimension for any “standardized” version of such a capacitated problem.

## 9. A Regional Production and Transportation Model
### Author(s):
- Edward B. Berman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
A linear programming model is set forth for maximizing a vector of final demand deliveries under both regional production constraints and transportation network constraints. The model is essentially designed to study short-run effects, and hence no provision is made for the expansion of either industrial or transportation capacities. Within available capacities, however, the location of production is chosen so as to maximize final demand deliveries.

## 10. A Note on the Multi-Commodity Warehouse Problem
### Author(s):
- Willard L. Eastman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
The warehouse problem requires the determination of a sequence of buy and sell decisions at discrete points in time. By equating points in time and points in space, the warehouse problem can be identified with a special case of the shortest-route problem. In the present note a special matrix formulation is employed to yield simple solutions to both problems. An example is included to illustrate the method.

## 11. A Note on Professor Manne's “Dominance” Theorem
### Author(s):
- R. E. Levitan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1959
### Abstract:
Professor Manne's paper recently appearing in this Journal (Manne, A. S. 1958. Programming of economic lot sizes. Management Sci.4 (2, January).) is an ingenious application of linear programming technique to what may have hitherto been regarded as an intractable non linear situation. The excellences of the paper are, however, marred by a gap in the proof of the “Dominance” theorem.
