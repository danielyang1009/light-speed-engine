## 1. On the Translocation of Masses
### Author(s):
- L. Kantorovitch
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
The following paper is reproduced from a Russian journal of the character of our own Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Comptes Rendus (Doklady) de I'Académie des Sciences de I'URSS, 1942, Volume XXXVII, No. 7–8. The author is one of the most distinguished of Russian mathematicians. He has made very important contributions in pure mathematics in the theory of functional analysis, and has made equally important contributions to applied mathematics in numerical analysis and the theory and practice of computation. Although his exposition in this paper is quite terse and couched in mathematical language which may be difficult for some readers of Management Science to follow, it is thought that this presentation will: (1) make available to American readers generally an important work in the field of linear programming, (2) provide an indication of the type of analytic work which has been done and is being done in connection with rational planning in Russia, (3) through the specific examples mentioned indicate the types of interpretation which the Russians have made of the abstract mathematics (for example, the potential and field interpretations adduced in this country recently by W. Prager were anticipated in this paper).

## 2. Some Experimental Games
### Author(s):
- Merrill M. Flood
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of six experiments and analyses performed to explore the applicability of the non-constant-sum case of the theories of von Neumann-Morgenstern, and others, to the actual behavior of people playing games or involved in bargaining situations. The paper suggests directions in which the theory of games might be modified and extended to improve its applicability and usefulness. A “split-the-difference principle” is suggested to augment the usual theory, so as to specify the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person bargaining situation such as the sale of a used car. The application of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation, people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find a better equilibrium, if there is one. The experiments show examples of non-optimal behavior of the bargainers when the judgment necessary to estimate the relevant payoff is obscure. A fair division of five parcels of objects among five players when each player attaches different values to the parcels is outlined and computed, and the effect of coalitions is discussed.

## 3. Contributions of Accounting to Measurement in Management
### Author(s):
- William J. Vatter
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
The quantitative aspects of business management were left almost entirely in the hands of accountants prior to the advent of “scientific management” some seventy-five years ago. Although this term has fallen into disuse, the emphasis upon quantitative bases for decision-making and control has increased as the management problem has become more complex. Needs for additional data and for more comprehensive analysis have brought changes in accounting to provide more frequent and more detailed information. New systems for processing data have been developed; in some cases these appear to have replaced or to have amended the traditional notions about accounting. Actually, none of the new methods really alters the basic situation: no one approach to managerial measurements is completely effective in all circumstances. What is really needed is a combination of techniques; traditional and novel methods, census and sampling techniques, general- and special-purpose analyses all contribute to the measurement objective. We should strive to combine all available quantitative techniques in such ways as will provide optimum service to meet the needs of management.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
The well known chemical equilibrium problem is expressed in the form of minimizing the free energy of a mixture in order to compute the chemical composition at equilibrium.

## 5. The Theory of Search: Optimum Distribution of Search Effort
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
This paper will be concerned with formulating the optimum allocation of search effort as a problem in convex programming so that their solutions may be made amenable to treatment by the adjacent extreme point methods of linear programming. Attention will be concentrated on discrete (statistical) distributions because this class of cases admits of the easiest and most straight-forward treatment. A sketch will then be given of how extensions may also be effected to continuous distributions.

## 6. A Theory of Conveyors
### Author(s):
- T. T. Kwo
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
The common loop overhead conveyor linking two manufacturing process areas is studied as a mechanism for transforming the output flow of one area into the input flow of the other. The variables relevant to a smooth transformation of flows and their inter-relationships are explored. Findings are formulated into three principles. On the conveyor operation problem, distinguished from the design problem, two methods of simulation are developed and practical suggestions advanced for use in feasibility and optimality considerations. A fundamental observation is that a conveyor is part of a dynamic system, hence information on the connected areas is essential to its smooth operation.

## 7. Development and Evaluation of Surveillance Sampling Plans
### Author(s):
- C. Derman
- H. Solomon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
The problem of maintaining quality of inventory in the presence of deterioration is studied. Repeated application of sampling inspections together with replacement policies are used to maintain quality. The effect of such repeated applications can be measured in terms of the proportion of poor product existing at any time. In this paper, the sampling plans studied are those commonly used in acceptance sampling, and the replacement policy consists in replacing lots judged defective by the sampling procedure. The theory of Markov processes is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the sampling plans and replacement policy. As illustrations, special cases are considered. Graphs are provided for these cases.

## 8. Dynamic Version of the Economic Lot Size Model
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
- Thomson M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
A forward algorithm for a solution to the following dynamic version of the economic lot size model is given: allowing the possibility of demands for a single item, inventory holding charges, and setup costs to vary over N periods, we desire a minimum total cost inventory management scheme which satisfies known demand in every period. Disjoint planning horizons are shown to be possible which eliminate the necessity of having data for the full N periods.

## 9. A Suggested Computation for Maximal Multi-Commodity Network Flows
### Author(s):
- L. R. Ford, Jr.
- D. R. Fulkerson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
A simplex computation for an arc-chain formulation of the maximal multi-commodity network flow problem is proposed. Since the number of variables in this formulation is too large to be dealt with explicitly, the computation treats non-basic variables implicitly by replacing the usual method of determining a vector to enter the basis with several applications of a combinatorial algorithm for finding a shortest chain joining a pair of points in a network.

## 10. LIFO vs FIFO in Inventory Depletion Management
### Author(s):
- Gerald J. Lieberman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
In their paper (Derman, C., M. Klein. Inventory depletion management. Technical Report No. 2, Oct. 1957, Statistical Engineering Group, Columbia University.), Derman and Klein present sufficient conditions on the field life of an item function under which a LIFO policy is optimal. This paper presents an alternate set of sufficient conditions under which a LIFO policy is optimal.

## 12. Toward More Clarity in Business Communications by Modern Logical Methods
### Author(s):
- Layman E. Allen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1958
### Abstract:
A systematically organized method of writing can improve an organization's communications. Such a systematic method of writing can be expressed in the technical notation of modern symbolic logic or in a modified form of ordinary English prose that can be easily understood by readers who have not had any training in modern logic. This method can provide both a means of detecting ambiguities and a means of simplifying complicated statements without changing their meaning. Once an ambiguity is detected a writer can cut that ambiguity out, or he can allow it to remain. He is not forced to delete ambiguity in the systematically organized method of writing suggested in this article. This method of writing is likely to be used by organizations if, and only if, its merits are fully understood.
