## 1. On Rational Decision Making
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
The occasion of this meeting marks one more incident in peaceful international existence. The very spirit of the meeting itself, in which intellectuals and managers of different nations meet to discuss their mutual problems, is a sign of our times. We of Canada and the USA have learned to develop sound international relationships just as we are learning to establish sound relationships between science and management.

## 2. Simulation of Finance Company Operations for Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Gordon B. Davis
- Howard Ambill
- Herbert Whitecraft
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
This paper describes the application of model building and computer simulation to planning, decision-making and budgeting. The discussion is based on the use of this approach for a proposed finance company. The mathematical model described in the paper was constructed and programmed for a computer. Various simulations on an IBM 7090 computer tested the feasibility of using the model as suggested. The examples in the text are from the simulation results.

## 3. Computer Simulation Yields Evaluation of Procurement Policies
### Author(s):
- John E. Gessford
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
This article contains a description of the concepts and techniques used in the computer simulation of a supply system containing geographically scattered sources, stock piles and consumption points. The simulation was successfully used to explore the effects of carrying lower inventories of a basic raw material.

## 4. Management Decision Technique in the Classification of Employee Skills
### Author(s):
- Henry Winthrop
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
An interesting problem which crops up in the field of industrial learning is the question of when an apprentice can be said to be a fully experienced operator. The importance of this question crops up for industrial training programs. It also occurs under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act which provides that during the learning period the apprentice can only receive an hourly rate which is less than the standard going hourly rate for experienced operators. It therefore becomes important to determine when the learning period is over for apprentices, so that they may receive the higher rate to which they are then entitled. This is equitable enough but the real question which then arises is by what criterion do we determine the actual length of the learning period. Management will tend to exaggerate its length and labor will tend to minimize it.

## 5. A Problem in Materials Economy
### Author(s):
- A. G. Sterling
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
This paper describes a study of several factors influencing the cost of a particular raw material blank, the policy changes based on this study, and the cost reduction accomplished by means of these changes. This general approach may be employed to reduce the raw material cost of a variety of machined components.

## 6. A Sugar Refinery Simulation Model
### Author(s):
- Richard M. Brooks
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1962
### Abstract:
For a number of years the California and Hawaiian Sugar Refining Corporation, Limited (C and H) has found it increasingly difficult to conduct experiments essential to improving refining technology or to gaining a greater understanding of the specific capabilities and limitations of its refinery at Crockett, California. This article discusses the manner in which the refining process was analyzed, describes in brief the formulation of the model, and reviews the benefits derived from the model's development and use.
