## 1. A System for Control of Order Backlog
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1962
### Abstract:
The application of inventory control theory to job shop operation has been limited, largely because the made-to-order nature of the product prohibits its accumulation in finished form prior to sale. In this situation it is, in fact, not inventory which must be controlled in order to achieve optimal operation, but rather it is the backlog of orders on hand at any time for production and delivery at some future time which requires management's attention. This paper describes a heuristic system for control of order backlog which was developed for a rather special type of job shop operation.

## 2. Dampening Production Level Response to Order Backlog Changes
### Author(s):
- James H. Scott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1962
### Abstract:
The textile industry is well known for its cyclical characteristic. The ups and downs, however, are largely due to changes in the order backlog position and the subsequent response in production and inventory levels.

## 3. A Plant-Warehouse System with Variable Lead-Times and Variable Re-Order Levels: The Cost Optimization—COPT—System
### Author(s):
- Paul A. Strassmann
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1962
### Abstract:
An analyst, in approaching the design of an integrated factory warehouse decision system, finds out that existing operations research theory concentrates on the rigorous solution of only limited and selected segments of the complex relationship between production and distribution. The fixed or economic order quantity re-ordering practice most frequently discussed in O/R literature results in an undesirable fluctuation in orders at the plant. If the manufacturer owns both the plants and the warehouses, he must incorporate an order smoothing decision rule into his system which must necessarily modify the size of the economic order quantity.

## 4. Economic Scheduling of Electric Power Production
### Author(s):
- R. M. Durstine
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1962
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) To review and discuss applications of mathematics to the scheduling of electric power production, which until recently has been subjected only to investigations of a restricted nature. (2) To illustrate, in the context of a particular electric power scheduling example, the point that the choice of techniques applied in problems of management science should be matched to the accuracy of the available input information, and to the practicality of carrying out the chosen technique.

## 5. Planned Replacement
### Author(s):
- Milton Kamins
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1962
### Abstract:
This report is part of a long-term study of maintenance policies and their effect on Air Force capabilities and costs. It specifically examines the interactions between planned replacement—a form of preventive maintenance—and the factors of reliability, availability, and cost. It is an abbreviated version of M. Kamins and J. J. McCall, Jr., Rules for Planned Replacement of Aircraft and Missile Parts, The RAND Corporation, Research Memorandum RM-2810-PR, November, 1961.
