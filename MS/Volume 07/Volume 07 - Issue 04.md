### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
During April, 1960, a meeting was held at the USSR Academy of Science, to discuss the use of mathematical methods in economic research and planning. Fifty six reports were circulated beforehand, in the following categories:
Mathematical Analysis of Expansion of Productivity.
Interdepartmental Balances.
Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming.
Transportation Models.
Other Models.
Mathematical Statistics.
In addition, a discussion of the use of electronic computers was given, with estimates of cost savings.

## 3. Aggregation of Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- E. Eisenberg
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
We are primarily concerned here with the question of integrability of the total demand in a model in which each consumer acts according to a cardinal utility function and has a fixed monetary income. It is well known that concavity of the various utilities is not sufficient to guarantee integrability, nor even to ensure rationality of the revealed preference. We show that if each personal utility function is homogeneous, in addition to satisfying the usual regularity conditions, then an aggregate utility function can be defined explicitly in terms of the given utilities. Furthermore, under the same assumptions we give a new characterization of equilibrium and show that equilibrium satisfactions are unique.

## 4. A Family of Inventory Models
### Author(s):
- G. Hadley
- T. M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
An inventory control model in which the state of the system is reviewed only at discrete, equally spaced time intervals is studied. A procurement is made if at the review period the inventory position of the system is less than or equal to a number k. The quantity procured is an integral multiple of a number Q. The total expected cost of review, procurement, holding inventory, and stockouts is determined under the assumption that all demands are ultimately met. The cost of a stockout is taken to consist of a fixed cost per unit out of stock plus a variable cost which is proportional to the time out of stock. Specific expressions for all the cost expressions are found for the case of (1) Poisson demands and fixed lead times, and (2) Poisson demands and gamma lead times. It is shown that many of the inventory models discussed in the literature are special cases of the model here described.

## 5. A Linear Programming Model for Long Range Capacity Planning
### Author(s):
- Robert B. Fetter
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
In comparing long- and short-term commitments to fulfill demand for some kind of capacity, a linear formulation of the problem may prove useful. The general capacity-planning problem treated here is that in which the demand for capacity may be met by ownership, leases of various terms, or spot contracts. Certain kinds of machine capacity, tankers, or trucks might be examples. Variations in demand and prices for the various alternatives give rise to a computational problem of considerable proportions and in addition one must account for the firm's time preference for money. A linear model is presented to aid in developing answers to such questions as the following: (1) What effect will any given demand forecast have on capacity plans, (2) what will be the effect of an expected change in ownership costs, (3) if prices for leased capacity increase by some given amount, how will plans and costs be affected, (4) what is the sensitivity of decisions and costs to forecast error? Computation of an optimal plan under various assumed conditions should provide (1) the best policy for the expected future and (2) those changes in policy which ought to follow from changed conditions.

## 6. A Nonlinear Programming Technique for the Optimization of Continuous Processing Systems
### Author(s):
- R. E. Griffith
- R. A. Stewart
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
A description is given of a method for solving some nonlinear programming problems. The mathematics of this method are quite simple and are easy to apply to electronic computation. A numerical example, a model construction example, and a description of a particular existing computer system are included in order to clarify the mode of operation of the method.

## 7. Inter-Temporal Analysis and Optimization of Bank Portfolios
### Author(s):
- D. Chambers
- A. Charnes
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with formulating, exploring and interpreting the uses and constructs which may be derived from a mathematical model of programming type which expresses more realistically than past efforts the actual conditions of current operations. It is an attempt to provide a means of attaining thereby an objective understanding of the implications of actual Federal Reserve liquidity policy on the actions and opportunities of banking institutions.

## 8. Computer Management Control Systems Through the Looking Glass
### Author(s):
- George F. Weinwurm
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
A discussion of three aspects of the introduction of real time computer executive control systems into the world of business, using as a frame of reference the experience acquired through the design and operation of a similar military system, SAGE, over the past several years. In particular, consideration is given to the relative effectiveness with which the system communicates with its environment, the necessary compromises in the definition of the rules by which the system will function, and certain difficulties in the concept of executive control systems which are in some sense adaptive.

## 9. Reactions to Intergroup Competition Under Win-Lose Conditions
### Author(s):
- Robert R. Blake
- Jane Srygley Mouton
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
Findings from investigations concerning the dynamics of intergroup competition under win-lose conditions are summarized first. The second step is to demonstrate, by presenting a synopsis of a real case, how these findings can be applied in converting a situation of management-union conflict into one of collaboration. The conclusion is that the industrial ethic which causes groups to interact with one another on a competitive win-lose basis, must and can be replaced by the new ethic which makes it possible for groups to approach their differences in points of view from a problem-solving orientation based on openness and reinforced by mutual respect and trust.

## 10. Administration of Safety in the Steel Industry
### Author(s):
- Chadwick J. Haberstroh
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1961
### Abstract:
Research in a single steel company highlighted the existence of autonomous safety goals and the importance of innovative activity in their realization. A key communications function in the process of innovation is performed by means of an industry-wide organization of staff specialists. Some confirmation of the relevance and effectiveness of this system is given by an analysis of plant injury rates for the steel industry as a whole.
