## 1. Some Team Models of a Sales Organization
### Author(s):
- C. B. McGuire
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1961
### Abstract:
The models presented in this paper grew out of an attempt to apply the theory of teams of Marschak and Radner to the organization of the sales force in a typical wholesale bakery. As organizations go, the one we have chosen to analyze is an extremely simple one, even when—as is quite obviously not the case in what follows—it is viewed in its full complexity. At the risk of achieving results of quite limited general interest, a “simple,” easily quantified subject was deliberately chosen as the best place to begin to apply a theory that pretends to prescribe optimum decisions of a team in a precise way.

## 2. The Role of Management Games in Education and Research

### Abstract:
This paper is intended to be a broad survey of both the present and the potential role of management games in education and research. Against a background of the history of business games, we first try to characterize the present development of these games. A few management games are described in some detail, and a number of others are mentioned only briefly. The differences between general and functional business games are discussed. Present uses of management games as a teaching device are surveyed and evaluated. Some hypotheses regarding the relations between the design and administrative characteristics of a business game and its educational properties are also formulated. What might be a major improvement over existing management games, here named the “game case,” is then suggested. In the concluding portion of this paper, the potential use of management games as a laboratory for business and social science research is surveyed. Some methodological problems which would arise from research uses of business games are also discussed.

## 3. A Network Flow Computation for Project Cost Curves
### Author(s):
- D. R. Fulkerson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1961
### Abstract:
A network flow method is outlined for solving the linear programming problem of computing the least cost curve for a project composed of many individual jobs, where it is assumed that certain jobs must be finished before others can be started. Each job has an associated crash completion time and normal completion time, and the cost of doing the job varies linearly between these extreme times. Given that the entire project must be completed in a prescribed time interval, it is desired to find job times that minimize the total project cost. The~method solves this problem for all feasible time intervals.

## 4. An Optimal Final Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- G. Hadley
- T. M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1961
### Abstract:
A model is developed which allows the determination of the optimal inventory level for an item at any time if no additional procurements are to be made. It is assumed that the item has a known date of obsolescence and that the demand is Poisson distributed with a fixed mean over the useful life of the tem. The model constitutes an extension of other life-of-type models in that both costs which are incurred at a fixed point in time (liquidation losses) and other costs which are a function of time (carrying charges and stock-out costs) are included. In many operational situations both of these types of costs are relevant.

## 5. A Note on Accelerated Dollar Averaging
### Author(s):
- George W. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1961
### Abstract:
The policy of accelerated dollar averaging as discussed by William T. Morris is an excellent contribution (Morris, W. T. 1959. Some analysis of purchasing policy. Management Sci.5 (4, July).) is essentially correct. The analysis, however, merits extension beyond the rather abbreviated treatment given in the article cited.
