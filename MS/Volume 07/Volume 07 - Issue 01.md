## 1. Quadratic Programming as an Extension of Classical Quadratic Maximization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
The article describes a procedure to maximize a strictly concave quadratic function subject to linear constraints in the form of inequalities. First the unconstrained maximum is considered; when certain constraints are violated, maximization takes place subject to each of these in equational (rather than inequality) form. The constraints which are then violated are added in a similar way to the constraints already imposed. It is shown that under certain general conditions this procedure leads to the required optimum in a finite number of steps. The procedure is illustrated by an example while also a directory of computations is given.

## 2. Summary of a Heuristic Line Balancing Procedure
### Author(s):
- Fred M. Tonge
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
This paper presents a heuristic procedure for balancing production assembly lines and a computer program for carrying out that procedure. This research was undertaken to investigate the application of complex information processing techniques (as used in producing the Chess Machine and Logic Theorist) to a typical industrial problem.

## 3. A Non-Linear Extension of the Simplex Method
### Author(s):
- Peter Wegner
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
This paper describes an algorithm for the solution of mathematical programming problems having a linear objective function and non-linear constraints. The algorithm is basically an adaptation of the simplex method to the case of non-linear constraints. Certain complications are, however, introduced through non-linearity in the constraints, and it is shown how these can be overcome.

## 4. A Note on the Optimal Range
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
With reference to previous publications on the advisability of defining an economic production range in case of batch production, it is pointed out that many industrial problems which involve optimization, may be characteristically similar. It is therefore desirable to study the sesitivity of the function to be optimized by computing an optimal range, for which a general approximation is suggested.

## 5. On the Interaction of Purchasing Motives and the Optimal Programming of Their Activation—A New Approach to the Evaluation of Advertising Themes
### Author(s):
- H. Emanuel
- L. H. Klaassen
- H. Theil
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
In recent years considerable attention has been paid by marketing theorists to the role of advertising and other promotional activities within the marketing policy of the firm and to their optimal setting in the combined operation of the various instruments available to such a policy. These authors have generally assumed efficient spending of money on advertising as far as choice of media and of purchase motivating themes are concerned. It is the object of the present paper to consider in some detail the second of these two problems—the efficient selection of purchase motivating themes for activation through advertising.

## 6. Relationships Between Organization Size and Efficiency
### Author(s):
- F. P. Adler
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1960
### Abstract:
The relation between productivity, efficiency and size of a technical organization as affected by internally generated and circulated paperwork is analyzed. It is shown that there exists an upper bound to total productive output which is independent of the number of employees; and that as the organization size is increased the efficiency generally first rises and then falls off inversely proportionally to the number of employees.
