## 1. The National Security Dilemma: Challenge to Management Scientists
### Author(s):
- Marshall K. Wood
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
This paper was presented as the banquet address at the 7th International Meeting of TIMS in New York City, October 20, 1960. The following paper, by Anatol Rapoport, was also on the program of this meeting. In view of the interest aroused by the contrasting positions taken, the Editor asked each author to submit his paper for publication in Management Science along with comments on the other's paper. The four resulting papers appear together in this issue of Management Science.

## 2. Three Modes of Conflict
### Author(s):
- Anatol Rapoport
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
It is possible to distinguish three levels of conflict. One level can be exemplified by a “fight,” i.e., a combat motivated only by mutual animosity or mutual fear. In a fight, the opponent is just a noxious stimulus. The actions of the combatants are dominated by an urge to destroy or to drive away this noxious stimulus. The~aggressive acts of each of the opponents stimulate aggressive counter acts of the other. This process, then, is mostly self-perpetuating and automatic. Such are the combats one finds in the sub-human world, combats between enemy species, between rivals for a mate, between competitors for food or living space.

## 3. Remarks on Marshall Wood's Paper
### Author(s):
- Anatol Rapoport
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
Assuming all the factual information and all the logistic estimates presented by Mr. Wood (Wood, M. K. 1961. The national security dilemma: Challenge to management scientists. Management Sci.7 (3) 195–209.) to be correct, I fail to see how his nine conclusions follow as logical consequences, unless some additional assumptions are made. Had these assumptions been made explicitly, we could quickly discover the real roots of our disagreement. As it is, I can do no more than treat Mr. Wood's nine propositions as opinions instead of conclusions, declare which of these opinions I share, and which I do not, and indicate my reasons for rejecting some of them.

## 4. Remarks on Anatol Rapoport's Paper
### Author(s):
- Marshall K. Wood
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
Professor Rapoport's article in this issue (Rapoport, A. 1961. Three modes of conflict. Management Sci.7 (3) 210–218.), and his recent book on the same subject, “Fights, Games and Debates,” provide mush valuable insight into the problems of conflict resolution. I am in agreement with this principles for the resolution of conflicts among individuals, whenever his basic assumptions are applicable.

## 5. The Use of Heuristic Programming in Management Science—A Survey of the Literature
### Author(s):
- Fred M. Tonge
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
Intelligent problem-solving, whether by man or by machine, implies selective rather than just rapid behavior. Humans achieve this selectivity through heuristics—principles that, on the average, contribute to reduction of search in problem-solving. Heuristic programming is the construction of computer problem-solving programs whose behavior is similarly organized. This paper surveys the present and potential use of heuristic programming in management science.

## 6. Characteristics of Optimal Maintenance Policies
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Bovaird
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
This paper presents an approach to maintenance planning which utilizes mathematics and economic theory to help select an optimal maintenance condition. The maintenance problem is discussed first with respect to short run (daily) routine operating decisions, and then with respect to long run decisions as they relate to equipment design and to maintenance facilities. The maintenance problem is then stated in mathematical terms.

## 7. Two Experiments on Bias and Conflict in Organizational Estimation
### Author(s):
- Richard M. Cyert
- James G. March
- William H. Starbuck
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
In recent years there has been increased interest in the effects of internal communication on decision processes. A number of hypotheses relating the bias in information to the final decision have been proposed. In this paper we discuss two laboratory experiments which were designed to test two such hypotheses. The first experiment tests the hypothesis that cost and sales estimations are made with the implicit assumption that a biased pay-off structure exists. The second experiment tests explicitly the effects of biased and unbiased pay-off structures on estimation within an organization. An analysis of the data for the two experiments is made and some implications for further research are drawn from the results.

## 8. Development of an Efficient Account-Numbering Method
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Trueman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
The desirability of maintaining customer accounts in both alphabetic and numeric sequence is discussed. An~account-numbering method is described which provides almost exact alphabetic and numeric sequencing even though the original file may grow by several hundred percent. The mathematical basis for the method is developed and an illustrative example shows how the method would be applied to the design of a particular account system.

## 9. On Scheduling Tasks with Associated Linear Loss Functions
### Author(s):
- Albert Schild
- Irwin J. Fredman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
In a recent paper in Management Science, Robert McNaughton has discussed certain problems encountered in scheduling tasks on one or more processors when penalties are imposed if the tasks are finished after their respective deadlines. In this paper, the general problem of scheduling the tasks on one processor in order to minimize the total loss is solved, and McNaughton's results are generalized.

## 10. On Production Smoothing
### Author(s):
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
The production planning model of Modigliani and Hohn and the smoothing model of Hoffman and Jacobs are combined. The most interesting result is that the horizon planning properties of the individual models are retained in the combined model. Methods are also given for the computation of optimal production schedules for certain kinds of requirements schedules.

## 11. Optimal Inventory Depletion Policies
### Author(s):
- Earl E. Bomberger
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
Consider a stockpile of items whose field life is a non-negative function of the age of the item upon being issued. Assume that only one item is in use at a time and that a demand occurs only when the item in use is completely exhausted.

## 12. FIFO and LIFO Policies in Inventory Management
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1961
### Abstract:
Evaluation of FIFO (=first in first out) versus LIFO (=last in first out) policies in stock depletion problems has hitherto been based on the classification of field life functions as convex and concave, the optimal policy for n > 2 units being determined when the optimal policy for n = 2 units is known. This paper suggests a test for selecting the optimal policy for the n = 2 system, for field life functions with a derivative equal or larger than −1, and by induction the conclusions are extended to n > 2. When the derivative is smaller than −1, LIFO is shown to be an optimal policy.
