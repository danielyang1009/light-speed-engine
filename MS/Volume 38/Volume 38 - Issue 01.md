## 1. A Composite Approach to Inducing Knowledge for Expert Systems Design
### Author(s):
- Ting-Peng Liang
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck for expert system design. One way to overcome this bottleneck is to induce expert system rules from sample data. This paper presents a new induction approach called CRIS. The key notion employed in CRIS is that nominal and nonnominal attributes have different characteristics and hence should be analyzed differently. In the beginning of the paper, the benefits of this approach are described. Next, the basic elements of the CRIS approach are discussed and illustrated. This is followed by a series of empirical comparisons of the predictive validity of CRIS versus two entropy-based induction methods (ACLS and PLS1), statistical discriminant analysis, and the backpropagation method in neural networks. These comparisons all indicate that CRIS has higher predictive validity. The implications of the findings for expert systems design are discussed in the conclusion of the paper.

## 2. Negotiation Analysis: A Characterization and Review
### Author(s):
- James K. Sebenius
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Negotiation analysis seeks to develop prescriptive theory and useful advice for negotiators and third parties. It generally emphasizes the parties' underlying interests (as distinct from the issues on the table and the positions taken), alternatives to negotiated agreement, approaches to productively manage the inherent tension between competitive actions to claim value individually and cooperative ones to create value jointly, as well as efforts to change perceptions of the game itself. Since advice to one side does not necessarily presume the full game-theoretic rationality of the other side(s), negotiation analysts often draw on the findings of behavioral decision analysts and economists. Further, this approach does not generally assume that all the elements of the game are common knowledge. Thus, the negotiation analytic approach tends to de-emphasize the application of game-theoretic solution concepts or efforts to find unique equilibrium outcomes. Instead, to evaluate possible strategies and tactics, negotiation analysts generally focus on changes in perceptions of the zone of possible agreement and the (subjective) distribution of possible negotiated outcomes conditional on various actions. This approach is especially sensitive to potentially unrealized joint gains. It has been used to develop prescriptive advice for the simplest bilateral negotiations between monolithic parties, for negotiations through agents or with linked internal and external aspects, for negotiations in hierarchies and networks, as well as for more complex coalitional interactions.

## 3. Eureka: A Hybrid System for Assembly Line Balancing
### Author(s):
- Thomas R. Hoffmann
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Numerous methods have been proposed for solution of the simple assembly line balancing (SALB) problem. This paper describes a branch and bound algorithm which in many cases is faster than the well-known Hoffmann heuristic technique to which it is related. It introduces a simple bounding rule which uses the concept of the theoretical minimum slack time to achieve rapid solutions. It is combined with the Hoffmann heuristic to develop an even more effective system for solving SALB problems. Timing results are given for a standard set of problems found in the literature. Since that set was solved in such a very short time, more challenging as well as more typical problems are explored and timing results presented. Benchmarking of the procedure is easier since implementation is on an eight-megahertz IBM AT with a math coprocessor, using the standard IBM PC Professional FORTRAN compiler.

## 4. Optimal Value Declaration in Buy-Sell Situations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Buy-Sell Shotgun clauses call for a partner who wishes to discontinue a partnership to declare a value for the business, and for the other partner to then buy her out or sell to her at this value. The resulting decision model for an expected utility maximizing individual, who is uncertain of the business' valuation by the partner, is analyzed. This model is also applicable to a divide and choose fair division method, as well as some historical tax/customs schemes, and is more general than comparable bidding/auctions models. After showing that the optimal declaration is always between the declarer's valuation and the fractile of the subjective distribution corresponding to the share owned, we show that the optimal declaration is always increasing in the valuation, and for a risk-neutral declarer also increasing in the share owned. We prove that the more risk-averse the declarer, the closer is the optimal declaration to the valuation, and the higher the probability that the partner who values the business more will end up owning it. Finally, we relate the optimal declaration to the degree of uncertainty concerning the partner's valuation.

## 5. Predicting Risk: Some New Generalizations
### Author(s):
- G. Andrew Karolyi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Existing adjustment techniques for forecasting systematic risk of individual firms have been based on relatively uniformative prior knowledge about the cross-sectional distribution of risk estimates. This study introduces prior information in the form of size and industry-based cross-sectional distributions of risk estimates. Such information is incorporated into forecasts using familiar and generalized adjustment techniques, the latter being based on recently developed multiple shrinkage methods. Improved forecast performance results.

## 6. NoteA Numerical Approach to Deriving Long-Run Equilibrium Solutions in Spatial Positioning Models
### Author(s):
- S. Chan Choi
- Wayne S. Desarbo
- Patrick T. Harker
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Choi, DeSarbo and Harker (1990) have recently proposed a numerical methodology for optimal product positioning and pricing under the assumption that the incumbents react only with price changes in the short run. The current note extends this methodology to include incumbents' long-run strategy of competitive product repositioning, in addition to price reactions. This note also introduces the notion of product relocation cost to the equilibrium analysis, and applies the concept of (full and partial) adjustment processes toward an equilibrium to model various strategic behavior of firms. This methodology is illustrated using an existing set of data collected for a major telecommunication equipment manufacturer.

## 7. On Properties of Stochastic Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Yu-Sheng Zheng
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
For most order quantity/reorder point inventory systems, the stochastic model, which specifies the demands as stochastic processes, is often more accurate than its deterministic counterpartthe EOQ model. However, the application of the stochastic model has been limited because of the absence of insightful analytical results on the model.

## 8. Production Lot Sizing with Machine Breakdowns
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
Economic lot sizing and batching models often assume reliable manufacturing facilities. In this research, we focus on the effects of machine breakdowns and corrective maintenance on the economic lot sizing decisions. Two production control policies are proposed for coping with these stochastic interferences. The first policy assumes that production of the interrupted lots is not resumed after a breakdown. Instead, the on-hand inventory is depleted before a new cycle is initiated. Under the second policy studied here, production is immediately resumed after a breakdown, if the current on-hand inventory is below a certain threshold level. It is shown that this control structure is optimal among all stationary policies. We show that under both policies the optimal lot sizes will always be bigger than the ones in a corresponding deterministic case, and that the optimal lot size increases with the failure rate. We also provide exact optimal and closed form approximate lot sizing formulas and derive tight bounds on the average cost per unit time for the approximations. In addition, we present various structural properties for these policies and operational insights relevant to such management decisions as machine replacement or maintenance schedules.

## 9. New Bounds for the Identical Parallel Processor Weighted Flow Time Problem
### Author(s):
- Scott Webster
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
In 1964, Eastman, Even, and Isaacs (EEI) presented a polynomial time lower bound for the NP-hard problem of scheduling n jobs on m available and identical processors to minimize weighted flow time. A general bound, of which the EEI bound is a special case, is proposed. Four new bounds for the identical processor problem are given. All of the new bounds can be applied to problems with variable processor ready times. The EEI bound is limited to problems where all processors are initially available at the same time. Two of the four new bounds are shown to dominate the EEI bound. The two other bounds are found to be effective for a particular problem class.

## 10. On Optimal Arrangement of Stations in a Tandem Queueing System with Blocking

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1992
### Abstract:
We consider tandem queueing networks with no waiting spaces and address the issue of ordering the stations so that the throughput (i.e., the departure rate) is maximized. Based on some theoretical and extensive empirical results, we propose two rules for ordering the stations. The first rule recommends arranging the two worst stations (according to our ordering) to the first and last stages. Numerical results show that this rule almost always agrees with the optimal ordering of stations. In cases where this rule does not agree with the optimal ordering, numerical results show that this rule leads to station arrangements that are near optimal. In addition, numerical results also indicate that the first rule is the most important one to achieve a near optimal throughput. The second rule arranges the remaining stations according to the so-called bowl phenomenon. Numerical results illustrate that an optimal arrangement of stations need not exhibit the bowl phenomenon, but the differences in the throughput between the optimal and the one obtained by the second rule are always very small (less than 0.5%).
