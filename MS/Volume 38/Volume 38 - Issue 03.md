## 1. Contracting for Software Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
Software contracting is a multi-faceted issue that involves legal, economic, managerial and technological considerations. To better understand the economic aspect of software contracting, this paper provides a summary review of software development contracts, followed by a gametheoretic model developed to incorporate incentive and information issues associated with software contracting. In the model an outside contractor is hired to develop a software system over multiple periods. Due to the uncertainties about costs or technology, the developer faces the risk of having to abandon the project at an intermediate phase. The user is better informed of the benefit of the system, while the developer privately discovers the development costs as the project advances. Given the limited information, the contracting parties make decisions in their own interest, leaving each party vulnerable to the other's opportunistic behavior. In this setting, we construct a viable contract that aligns the incentives of the contracting parties and produces the same equilibrium outcome as in in-house development. We also relate the implications of the model to the actual contract cases.

## 2. Indexing in Modeling Languages for Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
Indexing structures are of fundamental importance to modeling languages for mathematical programming as a device for mathematical abstraction, and because they facilitate achieving conciseness, stability, and error-resistance. The aim of this article is to stimulate discussion of such structures, especially the two most common kinds found in algebraic style languages: sets and relations. We offer a taxonomy of set-based and relation-based indexing structures, a suite of detailed examples illustrating this taxonomy, and a number of specific principles (some arguable and some not) for incorporating indexing structures into modeling languages. We also examine four modeling languages in detail with respect to their indexing capabilities: AMPL, GAMS, LINGO, and SML. By attempting to work all of the illustrative examples in each language, we are able to reach some conclusions concerning relative expressive power, economy of notation, obedience to our principles of good language design, ease of data handling, and other criteria.

## 3. Market Segmentation, Cannibalization, and the Timing of Product Introductions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
Consider a seller who faces two customer segments with differing valuations of quality of a durable product. Demand is stationary and known, the technology exists to release two products simultaneously, and the seller can commit in advance to subsequent prices and qualities. Should he introduce two differentiated products at once or one at a time? Under the simultaneous strategy, the lower quality would cannibalize demand for the higher quality. To reduce cannibalization, the seller could lower the quality of the low-end model and reduce the price of the high-end. Alternatively, he could increase the quality of the low-end model, but delay its release. Sequential introduction, however, would mean that the profits from the low-end model arrive later. We show that sequential introduction is better than simultaneous introduction when cannibalization is a problem and customers are relatively more impatient than the seller. However, when the seller cannot pre-commit, sequential selling is much less attractive because then he cannot use his product designs to alleviate cannibalization.

## 4. Patterns of Communication Among Marketing, Engineering and ManufacturingA Comparison Between Two New Product Teams
### Author(s):
- Abbie Griffin
- John R. Hauser
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
Models and scientific evidence suggest that firms are more successful at new-product development if there is greater communication among marketing, engineering, and manufacturing. This paper examines communication patterns for two matched product-development teams where the key difference between the groups is that one used a phase-review development process and the other used Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a product-development process adopted recently at over 100 United States and Japanese firms. To our knowledge, this is the first head-to-head comparison of traditional U.S. product development processes with QFD.

## 5. Joint Coherence in Games of Incomplete Information
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Nau
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
Decisions are often made under conditions of uncertainty about the actions of supposedly-rational competitors. The modeling of optimal behavior under such conditions is the subject of noncooperative game theory, of which a cornerstone is Harsanyi's formulation of games of incomplete information. In an incomplete-information game, uncertainty may surround the attributes as well as the strategic intentions of opposing players. Harsanyi develops the concept of a Bayesian equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium of a game in which the players' reciprocal beliefs about each others' attributes are consistent with a common prior distribution, as though they had been jointly drawn at random from populations with commonly-known proportions of types. The relation of such game-theoretic solution concepts to subjective probability theory and nonstrategic decision analysis has been controversial, as reflected in critiques by Kadane and Larkey and responses from Harsanyi, Shubik, and others, which have appeared in this journal. This paper shows that the Bayesian equilibrium concept and common prior assumption can be reconciled with a subjective view of probability by (i) supposing that players elicit each others' probabilities and utilities through the acceptance of gambles, and (ii) invoking a multi-agent extension of de Finetti's axiom of coherence (no arbitrage opportunities, a.k.a. Dutch books). However, the Nash property of statistical independence between players is weakened, and the probability distributions characterizing a solution of the game admit novel interpretations.

## 6. Control Variate Models for Estimating Transient Performance Measures in Repairable Item Systems
### Author(s):
- Mohamed A. Ahmed
- Donald Gross
- Douglas R. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
We develop a new modeling idea for comparing infinite-source, ample-server models (/) and finite-source, finite-server models (f/f). The comparison provides an efficient estimate of the error when approximating an f/f system with an / system and allows the analytical solution of the / model to be used as a control variate. We show that using / models as control variates for f/f systems can be an effective variance reduction technique for system performance estimates. Using these estimates will allow us to determine more efficiently when / models are good approximations for f/f systems.

## 7. Experiments with Initial Transient Deletion for Parallel, Replicated Steady-State Simulations
### Author(s):
- Peter W. Glynn
- Philip Heidelberger
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
A simple and effective way to exploit parallel processors in discrete event simulations is to run multiple independent replications, in parallel, on multiple processors and to average the results at the end of the runs. We call this the method of parallel replications. This paper is concerned with using the method of parallel replications for estimating steady-state performance measures. We report on the results of queueing network simulation experiments that compare the statistical properties of several possible estimators that can be formed using this method. The theoretical asymptotic properties of these estimators were determined in Glynn and Heidelberger (1989a, b). Both the theory and the experimental results reported here strongly indicate that a nonstandard (in the context of steady-state simulation), yet easy to apply, estimation procedure is required on highly parallel machines. This nonstandard estimator is a ratio estimator. The experiments also show that use of the ratio estimator is advantageous even on machines with only a moderate degree of parallelism.

## 8. A Nonlinear Heuristic Short-Term Model for Hydroelectric Energy Production: The Case of the Hazbani-Dan Water System
### Author(s):
- Gad Rabinowitz
- Abraham Mehrez
- Avi Rabina
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
A two-stage decision and control model for the operation of the power station in the Hazbani-Dan Water System (Israel) was developed and implemented. In this system, river water is stored and then either consumed by agricultural farms or released to a hydroelectric power station. Under management policy, agricultural consumption is taken as a constraint. The problem was solved via a two-stage procedure consisting of a long-term model (LTM) and a short-term model (STM). The LTM was presented by Rabinowitz et al. (1988). This paper reports on the development and analysis of the STM, in which operational flexibilities of the power station are taken into consideration, thereby improving the LTM solution.

## 9. Action Characteristics as Predictors of Competitive Responses
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1992
### Abstract:
A central question in competitive dynamics is whether a competitive response can be predicted. This study links various characteristics of actions with the total number and the time lag of competitors' responses. The hypothesized relationships were tested with a sample of competitive moves among U.S. airlines. The results suggested that responses are influenced by the characteristics of the actions that evoked them. Specifically, the total number of competitors affected by an action and the importance to these competitors of the markets under attack by the action increase the number of competitive responses. Strategic, as opposed to tactical, actions or actions which require substantial implementation efforts reduce the number and delay the timing of rivals' counteractions. Finally, contrary to prediction, competitors who have a high stake in the markets under attack by a competitive move react slowly.
