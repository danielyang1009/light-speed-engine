## 1. Implications of Errors in Survey Data: A Bayesian Model
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Data from surveys often include errors, and such errors can have a serious effect on inferences about behavior or perceptions. In this paper a model is developed for making inferences based on dichotomous survey data with possible errors. A likelihood analysis reveals an identification problem, which can be avoided when a Bayesian approach is taken. The model is illustrated with purchase recall data from two previous studies, and the analysis shows that errors can have a significant impact on inferences about behavior. Ignoring such errors leads to point estimates that are systematically too high in many cases and to interval estimates that are unrealistically narrow. The effective amount of information in the survey data is reduced dramatically by the presence of errors. These results have important implications for the use and value of survey data in marketing and in many other areas.

## 2. Managerial Applications of Neural Networks: The Case of Bank Failure Predictions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a neural-net approach to perform discriminant analysis in business research. A neural net represents a nonlinear discriminant function as a pattern of connections between its processing units. Using bank default data, the neural-net approach is compared with linear classifier, logistic regression, kNN, and ID3. Empirical results show that neural nets is a promising method of evaluating bank conditions in terms of predictive accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. Limitations of using neural nets as a general modeling tool are also discussed.

## 3. Composition Rules for Building Linear Programming Models from Component Models

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
This paper describes some rules for combining component models into complete linear programs. The objective is to lay the foundations for systems that give users flexibility in designing new models and reusing old ones, while, at the same time, providing better documentation and better diagnostics than is provided by current systems. The results presented here rely on two different sets of properties of LP models: first, the syntactic relationships among indices that define the rows and columns of the LP, and second, the meanings attached to these indices. These two kinds of information allow us to build a complete algebraic statement of a model from a collection of components provided by the model builder.

## 4. Representation Schemes for Linear Programming Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
Because of the difficulties often experienced in formulating and understanding large-scale models, much current research is directed towards developing systems to support the construction and understanding of management science models. This paper discusses eight different methods for representing linear programming models during the formulation phase. The approaches discussed are matrix generators, block-schematic and algebraic languages, three different kinds of graphical schemes, a database-oriented approach and Structured Modeling. While these eight approaches do not cover the entire spectrum of possible representation schemes, they are representative of past and current approaches to developing interfaces for large-scale linear programming systems. The different model representation schemes are compared using a common example and the transformations that allow one to change from one representation to another are discussed.

## 5. Congestion and Network Externalities in the Short Run Pricing of Information System Services
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Transfer pricing provides management with an efficient tool for coordinating the use of information system services. In practice these services, if they are charged out to end users, are priced via an allocation of historical costs based on individual usage, or are assigned a price based on the fair market value of outside alternatives. Both approaches encourage suboptimal usage of information systems resources: they ignore three constituents of optimal transfer prices: (1) the reaction of other users to any change in a given user's consumption of service; (2) the technical response to additional use of an information system service, in the form of congestion and network externalities; and (3) end-user preferences for the information system service. Together, these influences on demand contribute to an externality. Two types of externalities are significant in information systemscongestion externalities decrease, and network externalities increase the utility of services. This research provides a complete model for computing optimal transfer price which corrects several existing problems in information system service valuation. When full absorption cost allocations contain significant fixed, precommitted or sunk cost components, it is not possible to balance the budget. Direct costing improves on full absorption costing, but misspecifies costs when demand is nonlinear. To balance the budget with a minimum of disutility to end users management must resort to second-best pricing. Inefficiency arises from two sources when externalities are ignored in transfer pricing. End users cannot plan service usage, and thus encounter unanticipated congestion which lowers morale and efficiency, and increases costly expediting. Where congestion effects are highly nonlinear, congestion may effectively shut down the system. On the other hand, incorrect transfer prices can motivate usage too low to take advantage of network benefits. End users may confuse externality effects and intrinsic value of an information system service. In these cases, the price and performance of outside alternatives exert a complex and subtle influence on use and pricing of services. Where there exist identical outside and inside processing alternatives, and transfer pricing does not reflect this, there is a significant tendency to overprice and underutilize internal services. In this case there may be a tendency to outsource when processing should be kept in-house. Future markets for information systems will favor technologies which exhibit strong network externalities, and pricing of these technologies will become increasingly complex because of the interrelationship of hardware, software and data originated externalities. The models provided in this research will allow management to take advantage of these opportunities.

## 6. Nonlinear Utility Models Arising from Unmodelled Small World Intercorrelations
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Bordley
- Gordon Hazen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
Savage's axioms show the rationality of maximizing expected utility when all uncertainties are explicitly modelled. But individuals actually make decisions in bounded contexts called small worlds. Savage's axioms do not imply the optimality of maximizing expected utility in small worlds unless lotteries in different small worlds are probabilistically independent. Relaxing this independence assumption causes Savage's axioms to imply the optimality of maximizing a nonlinear utility model which includes, as special cases, the Chew weighted linear utility model, the Bell elation/disappointment model and the Allais mean/variance model in utility-independent small worlds.

## 7. A Broader View of the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
We define a job-shop scheduling problem with three dynamic decisions: assigning due-dates to exogenously arriving jobs, releasing jobs from a backlog to the shop floor, and sequencing jobs at each of two workstations in the shop. The job-shop is modeled as a multiclass queueing network and the objective is to minimize both the work-in-process (WIP) inventory on the shop floor and the due-date lead time (due-date minus arrival date) of jobs, subject to an upper bound constraint on the proportion of tardy jobs. A general two-step approach to this problem is proposed: (1) release and sequence jobs in order to minimize the WIP inventory subject to completing jobs at a specified rate, and (2) given the policies in (1), set due-dates that will attempt to minimize the due-date lead time, subject to the job tardiness constraint. A simulation study shows that this approach easily outperforms other combinations of traditional due-date setting, job release, and priority sequencing policies for two cases (moderately loaded and heavily loaded) of a particular shop. As a result of the study, three scheduling principles are proposed that can significantly improve the performance of a two-station job-shop; in particular, better due-date performance can be achieved by ignoring due-dates on the shop floor. Although we have only considered a two-station shop, the approach and scheduling principles presented here might also be useful for larger shops.

## 8. Forecast Horizons in the Discounted Dynamic Lot Size Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1992
### Abstract:
We derive a sharp upper bound on the minimal forecast horizon in the discounted dynamic lot size model with constant initial demand. This bound is given by m(m + 1), where m is the EOQ's worth, i.e., the number of periods for which the total demand equals Economic Order Quantity. Our results do not require the solution of the infinite horizon problem to be unique. Nor do they require the infinite horizon problem to be well defined. We also prove some sensitivity results with respect to the discount factor and the setup cost.

## 9. An Integrated Simulation and Dynamic Programming Approach for Determining Optimal Runway Exit Locations

### Abstract:
The Federal Aviation Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration are researching several problems targeted at improving airport capacity. Among the foremost of these problems is the issue of improving the operational use of runways. The efficiency of runway usage is dictated primarily by the runway occupancy time (ROT) which is the time that an aircraft spends on the runway or its vicinity, until a new arrival or departure can be processed on this runway. This paper considers the problem of determining the geometry and location of high speed exits on a runway to minimize the weighted ROT of a population of aircraft under various landing scenarios and frequencies of usage. Both the problem of designing a new runway and modifying an existing one are addressed. It is shown that the continuous location problem of siting runway turnoffs admits a natural finite set of candidate optimal locations. To characterize problem data and determine optimal exit locations, a simulation program integrated with a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm is developed. The methodology has been implemented on a personal computer, and an example is presented to illustrate the approach.
