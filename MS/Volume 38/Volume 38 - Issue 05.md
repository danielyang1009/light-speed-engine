## 1. Optimal Acquisition of Pollution Control Equipment Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Hartl
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers a firm, which has to acquire a certain amount of pollution control equipment in order to comply with government pollution standards. Due to political battles and lobbying efforts, the compliance date and the date when it is announced are not known in advance. Furthermore, the target stock of pollution control equipment is also unknown. This amounts to an optimal control problem, in which the terminal time and the terminal state are random variables for which certain probability distributions can be estimated. The model explicitly considers technological progress in the production of abatement equipment, which leads to decreasing installation costs over time. Furthermore it is assumed that having a high stock of abatement equipment at early stages improves the firm's public image and thus its revenue. Tax deductions and other benefits for health conscious firms are also taken into account.

## 2. Aspiration Level Adaptation: An Empirical Exploration
### Author(s):
- Theresa K. Lant
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
Organizations have been modeled as goal directed systems which use simple decision rules to adapt behavior in response to performance feedback. This paper examines the formation of organizational goals, or aspiration levels, over time in groups of individuals representing top management teams of simulated organizations. The analysis compares the empirical validity of an adaptive attainment discrepancy model with models derived from rational and adaptive expectations theories. The results suggest that the attainment discrepancy model, which is based on a simple decision rule of adjustment to performance feedback, provides the most robust description of aspiration formation. They are also informative with regard to the application of expectation models to aspiration formation: There is a great deal of similarity between these results and those of prior studies on expectation formation. In addition, the study finds that there tends to be an optimistic bias in aspiration formation, that adaptation is not consistently incremental, and that adaptive learning may, over time, lead to behavioral outcomes that are consistent with rationality.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Management science and decision science have grown exponentially since midcentury. Two closely-related fields central to this growth are multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) and multiattribute utility theory (MAUT). This paper comments on the history of MCDM and MAUT and discusses topics we believe are important in their continued development and usefulness to management science over the next decade. Our aim is to identify exciting directions and promising areas for future research.

## 4. Renovation of Public Housing: Suggestions from a Simple Model
### Author(s):
- Michael E. Gleeson
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This paper presents a simple model to contrast the benefit and cost of renovating public housing units against the benefit and cost of building new ones. Benefit is measured as the additional expected life created, and empirically-estimated survivor functions for housing are used to calculate maximum costs at which renovation is cost-effective relative to new construction. Actual renovation costs for an existing program are compared with calculated maximums. Results suggest that past renovation practice may not have been cost-effective relative to new construction. Possible changes in program guidelines are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications.

## 5. Current Issues in Frequency Domain Experimentation
### Author(s):
- Robert G. Sargent
- Tapas K. Som
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This paper presents an examination of certain issues in Frequency Domain Experimentation (FDE) for discrete event simulation. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that (i) conclusions drawn from FDE are dependent on the oscillation frequency and unless frequencies are chosen carefully, misleading results can be obtained; (ii) interpretation of results from frequency domain experiments are fundamentally different from the interpretation of results from regression analysisspecifically, a term found significant by FDE is not to be interpreted as a term able to explain a significant portion of the variation in the response over the experimental region; and (iii) basic assumptions required for FDE, in particular the assumption that input and output processes constitute a time-invariant linear system, do not hold for M/M/1 queues. Other issues discussed are indexing, run length determination, computational effort, and why FDE is not applicable for terminating simulations. It is concluded that further developments are needed before FDE can be used by practitioners.

## 6. Stopped Myopic Policies in Some Inventory Models with Generalized Demand Processes
### Author(s):
- William S. Lovejoy
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers single-item inventory systems with immediate delivery and no economies of scale. Bounds are provided on the value loss relative to optimal cost for restricting attention to the class of inventory stocking policies that behave myopically up to a specified stopping time. The stopping time may be random, and may depend on demand histories as well as information exogenous to the firm. The bounds are robust to the nature of the demand process faced after the stopping time, so are applicable when the statistics of demand after the stopping time are unknown. Stopping times that are large with high probability imply that near-term decisions are completely specified with high probability. The general bounding results allow one to consider demand processes that may otherwise be analytically intractable.

## 7. Understanding the Efficiency of Multi-Server Service Systems
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
In the design and operation of service systems, it is important to determine an appropriate level of server utilization (the proportion of time each server should be working). In a multi-server queue with unlimited waiting space, the appropriate server utilization typically increases as the number of servers (and the arrival rate) increases. We explain this economy of scale and give a rough quantitative characterization. We also show how increased variability in the arrival and service processes tends to reduce server utilization with a given grade of service. As part of this analysis, we develop simple approximations for the mean steady-state waiting time and the full steady-state waiting-time distribution. These approximations exploit an infinite-server approximation for the probability of delay and a single-server approximation for the conditional waiting-time distribution given that waiting occurs. The emphasis is on simple formulas that directly convey understanding.

## 8. Deterministic Approximations to Co-Production Problems with Service Constraints and Random Yields
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Thin-Yin Leong
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
We study production planning problems where multiple item categories are produced simultaneously. The items have random yields and are used to satisfy the demands of many products. These products have specification requirements that overlap. An item originally targeted to satisfy the demand of one product may be used to satisfy the demand of other products when it conforms to their specifications. Customers' demand must be satisfied from inventory 100% of the time. We formulate the problem with service constraints and provide near-optimal solution to the problem with fixed planning horizon. We also propose simple heuristics for the problem solved with a rolling horizon. Some of the heuristics performed very well over a wide range of parameters.

## 9. NoteControlling Inventories in an Acyclic Assembly System
### Author(s):
- Christopher S. Tang
### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This note presents a model of an acyclic assembly system that faces yield loss and uncertain demand. While there is no known production rule for managing acyclic systems, we develop a production rule whose operating characteristics could be measured analytically. Thus, the operating characteristics can be used as a benchmark for future comparison. To facilitate our analysis, we extend the model for a serial production system that produces a single product (Tang 1990). This extension entails a modification of the production rule and the analysis of a decomposition scheme.

### Published:
- 1 May 1992
### Abstract:
This note considers a problem of simultaneous selection of a subset of N projects and determination of an optimal sequence to implement these projects so as to maximize the net present value of the total return. We first establish an optimal sequence of all projects which does not depend on the particular subset of selected projects and then propose an efficient polynomial dynamic programming method for solving the problem.
