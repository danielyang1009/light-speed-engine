### Abstract:
The performance of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) programs is summarized typically as the average probability of achieving pregnancy per cycle. Variation in conception probabilities across women reduces the usefulness of such an aggregate measure. More relevant is the conditional probability of achieving pregnancy on a given cycle following a number of failed IVF-ET attempts. We construct a model that accurately describes 1,257 treatment cycles performed at Yale over 571 different women. The model assumes a split population, where some women can never conceive via IVF-ET, while the remaining women have identical and constant per cycle probabilities of conception. This model produces estimates that are highly consistent with the data, and suggests that continuing treatment beyond some threshold number of cycles is not efficacious. Recognizing this, we determine cutoffs beyond which treatment should not continue for IVF-ET programs with fixed capacities. We also consider cutoff policies where program participants may belong to one of several different split populations, detailing the case of two groups. Finally, we show how one may reduce the average time in treatment (including waiting time) considerably with minimal impact on the probability of achieving pregnancy.

## 2. An Empirical Investigation of Advertising Strategies in a Dynamic Duopoly
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
The equilibrium profit-maximizing advertising policies of firms operating in a dynamic duopoly are derived by linking in a single framework the econometric estimation of the market response function and the technique of differential games that characterizes dynamic competitive behavior. We use the Lanchester model of combat to represent the system dynamics that capture the competitive shifts due to investments in advertising by the two market rivals. We determine the equilibrium advertising levels using both closed- and open-loop policies. We also compare these equilibrium advertising policies for each firm to those obtained using an optimal control theory formulation wherein the advertising spending levels of the rival are assumed to be known.

## 3. The Analysis of Activity Networks Under Generalized Precedence Relations (GPRs)
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
We present a model for activity networks under generalized precedence relations (GPRs), discuss its temporal analysis and the issues that may arise relative to inconsistency among the specified relations and the activity durations. We also give more precise definition to the concept of criticality of an activity, and introduce the new concept of flexibility of an activity which is akin to the traditional concept of activity floats in regular CPM, with the latter taking on different meaning from its common interpretation in standard CPM.

## 4. Gaining Comparative Advantage Through Discretionary Expenditures: The Returns to R&D and Advertising
### Author(s):
- Gary Erickson
- Robert Jacobson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
We explore the extent to which R&D and advertising expenditures generate a comparative advantage that allows firms to earn supranormal profits. After controlling for unobserved firm-specific factors and the feedback between discretionary expenditures and profitability, our results suggest substantially lower accounting and stock market returns to R&D and advertising than indicated in previous research. Isolating mechanisms, which prevent imitation, do not appear sufficient for either R&D or advertising expenditures to generate, on the average, a long-run comparative advantage.

## 5. Behavioral Consequences of Corporate Incentives and Long-Term Bonuses: An Experimental Study
### Author(s):
- Andrew Schotter
- Keith Weigelt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether long-term managerial bonus schemes change the allocative behavior of subjects in a laboratory setting. Using four different compensation schemes, we show that a necessary condition for reconciling divergent time preferences between principals and agents is a compensation scheme that induces behavior consistent with lower discount rates. Within subject results show that subjects recognize changes across compensation schemes and change their behavior as predicted by formal theory. Results also suggest that subjects become more myopic in their investment decisions if compensation contracts are incorrectly structured.

## 6. Analysis of the Deterministic (s, S) Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Ananth V. Iyer
- Linus E. Schrage
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
The traditional or textbook approach for finding an (s, S) inventory policy is to take a demand distribution as given and then find a reorder point s and order up to point S that are optimal for this demand distribution. In reality, the demand distribution may have been obtained by fitting it to some historical demand stream. In contrast, the deterministic (s, S) inventory problem is to directly determine the (s, S) pair that would have been optimal for the original demand stream, bypassing the distribution fitting step. The deterministic (s, S) inventory problem thus chooses parameters s and S which minimize setup, holding and backorder costs when the corresponding (s, S) policy is implemented over n periods with known demands d1, d2,, dn. Our contributions are two: (a) a polynomial time algorithm for finding an optimal (s, S) for the deterministic problem, and (b) an empirical comparison of the two approaches. In (b) we compare the long term average costs of the two approaches as a function of the amount of data available, distributional assumptions, and order lead time.

## 7. Lot Sizing to Reduce Capacity Utilization in a Production Process with Defective Items, Process Corrections, and Rework
### Author(s):
- Hau L. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the lot sizing problem in which the key features of imperfections in a production process are explicitly modelled. These features include: process shifting to out-of-control states, detection of the out-of-control shifts, corrective actions following the detections, and the fixed setup and variable processing times of reworks. The problem is motivated by the wafer probe operation in semiconductor manufacturing. The key objective that drives the lot sizing decision is to reduce the total processing time on a critical resource. Such an objective is aimed at reducing the congestion level at this resource.

## 8. A Lagrangean Relaxation Approach for Very-Large-Scale Capacitated Lot-Sizing
### Author(s):
- Moustapha Diaby
- Harish C. Bahl
- Mark H. Karwan
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a Lagrangean relaxation-based heuristic procedure to generate near-optimal solutions to very-large-scale capacitated lot-sizing problems (CLSP) with setup times and limited overtime. Our computational results show that large problems involving several thousand products and several thousand 0/1 integer variables can be solved in a reasonable amount of computer time to within one percent of their optimal solution. The proposed procedure is general enough to be applied directly or with slight modification to real-life production problems.

## 9. The Dynamic Line Allocation Problem
### Author(s):
- Reza H. Ahmadi

- Christopher S. Tang
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
Consider a plant that has information about the arrival schedule of its inputs over a planning cycle. The plant has parallel production lines for processing multiple types of products. However, changeover cost and changeover time are incurred when a line changes from processing one type of products to a different type of products. We present a dynamic line allocation problem that determines an optimal line allocation so that the total relevant cost (changeover and waiting costs) is minimized. In this paper we analyze the complexity of the problem and develop three different heuristics for generating near-optimal allocations.

## 10. NoteOperator Assignment and the Parametric Preflow Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Robert J. Wittrock
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
This note addresses a problem of assigning human operators to operations in a manufacturing system. The problem involves a set of operations, a work load for each operation, and a set of human operators, each skilled at a subset of the operations. The task is to assign the operators to the operations so as to maximize the capacity of the system, robustly. The problem is formulated as a network flow problem with a lexicographic objective. It is then shown how to solve this problem very efficiently as a parametric sequence of network maximum flow problems, by application of the parametric preflow algorithm of Gallo, Grigoriadis and Tarjan.

## 11. NotePathwise Convexity and its Relation to Convergence of Time-Average Derivatives
### Author(s):
- Peter W. Glynn
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1992
### Abstract:
In this note, we further develop the pathwise convexity approach introduced by Hu (1991) to prove consistency of infinitesimal perturbation analysis for the derivative of the steady-state waiting time of the G/G/1 queue. In addition to generalizing the argument, we illustrate the technique with applications to stochastic storage theory and networks of queues.
