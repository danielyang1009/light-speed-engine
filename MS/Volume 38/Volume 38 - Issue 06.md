## 1. Managing I/S Design Teams: A Control Theories Perspective
### Author(s):
- John C. Henderson

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
The control relationship between project managers and team members is a central aspect of the working of any Information System (I/S) design team. This paper combines research on managerial control and team-member control in order to explore a range of control behaviors that can affect the performance of an I/S design team. Measures are developed and validated for managerial control and team-member control from both an outcome and a process perspective. Results from a study of 41 actual I/S design teams indicate that high-performing teams exhibit high process control by managers and high outcome control by team members. The results also support the proposition that both managerial and team-member control coexists and that increases in the total level of control behavior is positively correlated with performance.

## 2. The Relationship of Industry Evolution to Patterns of Technological Linkages, Joint Ventures, and Direct Investment Between U.S. and Japan
### Author(s):
- Ellen R. Auster
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
Although economic activity between the U.S. and Japan has skyrocketed in the last decade, there are few large sample, cross-industry studies analyzing multiple forms of investment by the Japanese in the U.S. This study analyzes the key characteristics of each stage of industry evolution and the costs and benefits of each form of resource investment to predict the patterns of technological linkages, joint ventures, and direct investment of Japanese companies in the U.S. The results find support for a model predicting a predominance of technological linkages in emerging industries, joint ventures in growing industries, and direct investment in maturing industries. Technological linkages are most attractive in emerging industries as firms struggle to acquire technology, information and expertise and share cost and risk, yet retain flexibility. Joint ventures proliferate in growing industries because they offer a means of acquiring and expanding customer bases, yet reducing vulnerability. In maturing industries, where firms' key competencies are more developed, direct investment allows the company to generate demand in new markets without the disadvantage of joint governance.

## 3. Brand Extensions: When to Use Them
### Author(s):
- Mary W. Sullivan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
This empirical study investigates whether brand extensions should be introduced early or late in the life cycle of a product category. The longitudinal/cross-category sample of frequently purchased consumer brands is used to analyze how the performance of brand extensions depends on order of entry. The results indicate that early-entering brand extensions do not perform as well on average as either early-entering new-name products or late-entering brand extensions. This conclusion is based on four findings. First, the brand extensions were introduced later on average than the new-name products. Second, the early brand extensions had a lower probability of surviving than either the early-entering new-name products or the late-entering brand extensions. Third, the brand extensions earned higher market shares on average than new-name products, controlling for order of entry. Fourth, the extensions obtained smaller market share premia from entering early than did new-name products.

## 4. Repeated Gambles, Learning, and Risk Aversion
### Author(s):
- Kevin F. McCardle
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
We analyze a decision problem with repeated gambles and find that under some seemingly reasonable risk-averse utility functions, recommended behavior for the initial decision can be highly risk-taking and counterintuitive. Further analysis reveals that the derived utility function for the return on the first gamble is discontinuous because gains or losses carry with them positive or negative signals regarding future prospects. A variant of the basic model without a discontinuity in derived utility has essentially the same implications. The issues raised in this paper present no conceptual difficulties for the standard expected utility theory; in principle, we can model the grand world and understand fully all implications of grand-world utility functions. In practice, however, this ideal may not always be attainable and as a result we may be faced with serious modeling and assessment problems.

## 5. Estimating the Impact of Uncertainty on a Deterministic Multiattribute Evaluation
### Author(s):
- Craig W. Kirkwood
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
A method is presented to estimate the impact of uncertainty on the results of a multiattribute evaluation prior to conducting a complete probabilistic multiattribute utility analysis. The method assumes that a deterministic analysis has been completed using a weighted-additive multiattribute value (evaluation) function and that either an additive or multiplicative utility function is appropriate for the multiattribute utility analysis. An approximation procedure is developed to estimate whether uncertainty about attribute levels could change the deterministic evaluation results. An illustrative application investigates the accuracy of the procedure and its use to simplify analysis of the effects of uncertainty.

## 6. On Matching Book: A Problem in Banking and Corporate Finance
### Author(s):
- M. Shubik
- M. J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
In each of the asset and liability markets in which the banking firm is an intermediary, typically there are instruments with differing maturities. The bank matching book problem is to manage the term structures of assets and liabilities. In our first model, the bank borrows and lends only short run. In our second model, the bank borrows only short run but can lend short run and long run. The criterion in both models is the expected value of the present value of dividends issued. Both models yield dynamic programming problems. Broad aspects of optimal policies are indicated.

## 7. Rational Mean-Variance Decisions for Subsistence Farmers
### Author(s):
- Bernard V. Tew
- Donald W. Reid
- Giles T. Rafsnider
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
This paper explores the issue of approximating expected utility in applying portfolio theory. It has been demonstrated that expected utility is very closely approximated by an appropriate quadratic function. Recent studies have again questioned the empirical validity of mean-variance analysis. These efforts disregard the importance of the differences among various approximations, and historically, have focused on domestic financial securities. We re-examine the problem in the context of determining risk-efficient portfolios of production activities for subsistence farmers. The risks faced by these farmers are large and probably actuarially nonneutral. Thus, recommendations based on an inappropriate quadratic approximation could result in substantial losses in welfare.

## 9. Risk, Return, Skewness and Preference
### Author(s):
- Patrick L. Brockett
- Yehuda Kahane
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers choice between individual projects and shows that when the choice set includes arbitrary distributions, then any assumed relationship between expected utility theory and general moment preferences for individual decision makers is theoretically unsound. In particular, a risk averse investor with any common utility function may, when choosing between two positive return opportunities, prefer the project simultaneously having a lower mean, higher variance, and lower positive skewness. Moreover, the decision maker can prefer opportunities with higher variance even when the opportunities are continuous, unimodal, and arbitrarily visually and statistically close to the normal distribution in shape. Our conclusions hold for any decision maker with a utility function whose derivatives alternate in sign being strictly positive or negative (i.e., we exclude the uninteresting cases of quadratic and cubic utilities).

## 10. Service by a Queue and a Cart
### Author(s):
- E. G. Coffman, Jr.
- E. N. Gilbert
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
Items arrive randomly at a production facility that functions as a single-server queueing system. The items might represent parts, raw material, etc. and the server might be a factory worker or a machine in a production line. Following service, items are placed in a buffer where they are accumulated before delivery to a customer or some downstream activity in a production line. In practice, the buffer might be called a hopper; it may take the form of a cart or a pallet moved by a forklift. For simplicity the discussion here keeps with the cart terminology.

## 11. Some Guidelines and Guarantees for Common Random Numbers
### Author(s):
- Paul Glasserman
- David D. Yao
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1992
### Abstract:
Common random numbers (CRN) is a widely-used technique for reducing variance in comparing stochastic systems through simulation. Its popularity derives from its intuitive appeal and ease of implementation. However, though CRN has been observed to work well with a broad range of models, the class of systems for which it is provably advantageous has remained rather limited.
