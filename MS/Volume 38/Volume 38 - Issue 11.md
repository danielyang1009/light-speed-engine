## 2. The Capital Asset Pricing Model with Diverse Holding Periods
### Author(s):
- Haim Levy
- Paul A. Samuelson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
Assuming that assets are traded in discrete time and that risk averse investors differ in their holding periods, we investigate the conditions under which the CAPM holds. It is shown that when portfolio rebalancing is allowed the CAPM holds in four cases not rigorously analyzed previously. These four cases are: (a) quadratic preferences; (b) one-period normal distributions when utility is defined on the multiperiod terminal wealth which is not normal; (c) the terminal wealth is log-normally distributed; and (d) the terminal wealth WT is normally distributed, but in this case diverse holding periods are not allowed. Case d is similar to the Sharpe-Lintner model with the exception that T  1 revisions are allowed.

## 3. The CAPM and the Calendar: Empirical Anomalies and the Risk-Return Relationship
### Author(s):
- Charles Bram Cadsby
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
Tinic and West (1984) argue that a tradeoff between risk and return exists only in January. This study demonstrates that it is not just the January Effect on stock returns which is related to the measured risk-return relationship and how that measure is apparently affected by the calendar. Other returns anomalies can also be paired with a conclusion about the relationship between risk and return. For example, risk appears to be rewarded at the turn of the month but not during the rest of the year and late in the week but not early in the week. This paper argues that, given the returns anomalies, the corresponding calendar effects on the risk-return relationship are consistent with the CAPM. Thus, the anomaly to be explained is not the relationship between risk and return focused on by Tinic and West (1984) but rather the calendar related variations in the returns themselves.

## 4. Growth Versus Security in Dynamic Investment Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
This paper concerns the problem of optimal dynamic choice in discrete time for an investor. In each period the investor is faced with one or more risky investments. The maximization of the expected logarithm of the period by period wealth, referred to as the Kelly criterion, is a very desirable investment procedure. It has many attractive properties, such as maximizing the asymptotic rate of growth of the investor's fortune. On the other hand, instead of focusing on maximal growth, one can develop strategies based on maximum security. For example, one can minimize the ruin probability subject to making a positive return or compute a confidence level of increasing the investor's initial fortune to a given final wealth goal. This paper is concerned with methods to combine these two approaches. We derive computational formulas for a variety of growth and security measures. Utilizing fractional Kelly strategies, we can develop a complete tradeoff of growth versus security. The theory is applicable to favorable investment situations such as blackjack, horseracing, lotto games, index and commodity futures and options trading. The results provide insight into how one should properly invest in these situations.

## 5. Daily Stock Market Volatility: 19281989
### Author(s):
- Andrew L. Turner
- Eric J. Weigel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
This paper examines the daily return variability of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices over the 19281989 period. We use the traditional close-to-close standard deviation of returns, two alternative estimators incorporating the daily high and low of the index, and a robust estimator to measure the volatility of stock index returns. The 1980s were the third most volatile decade behind the 1920s and 30s. To a large extent, this was caused by the anomalous behavior of the fourth quarter of 1987. Returns in the 1980s had far more skewness and kurtosis than in any other decade studied; these results were not entirely due to 1987, as returns in 1988 and 1989 had large measures of both skewness and kurtosis. The frequency of extreme-return events increased in the 1980s, but was still dramatically less than the 1920s and 30s. When extreme negative days occurred in the 1980s the losses tended to be more severe than in the previous four decades. Extreme-return days are preceded by significant losses and are intertemporally clustered. There is no evidence of short-term market reversals after either positive or negative jumps in stock index returns.

## 6. The Pricing of Japanese Equity Warrants
### Author(s):
- Hiroto Kuwahara
- Terry A. Marsh
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
Discrepancies between the Black-Scholes value of Japanese equity warrants and their observed prices are explained in part by the stochastic volatility of changes in prices of the underlying stocks. We fit GARCH and EGARCH models to the stochastic volatility and briefly compare their performance to the CEV model. A hopscotch algorithm is used to value the warrants in the presence of the stochastic stock price volatility. The stochastic volatility-hopscotch warrant values still differ substantially from corresponding prices; in contrast, away-from-the-money short-term Nikkei 225 options valued with the same stochastic volatility models are close to observed prices. A regression model is used to fit the differences between warrant values and prices as a function of proxies for market impediments.

## 7. Stochastic Network Programming for Financial Planning Problems
### Author(s):
- John M. Mulvey
- Hercules Vladimirou
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
Several financial planning problems are posed as dynamic generalized network models with stochastic parameters. Examples include: asset allocation for portfolio selection, international cash management, and programmed-trading arbitrage. Despite the large size of the resulting stochastic programs, the network structure can be exploited within the solution strategy giving rise to efficient implementations. Empirical results are presented indicating the benefits of the stochastic network approach for the asset allocation case.

## 8. Complete Prepayment Models for Mortgage-Backed Securities
### Author(s):
- Pan Kang
- Stavros A. Zenios
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1992
### Abstract:
The estimation of prepayment rates for pools of mortgages is a critical component in determining the value of mortgage-backed securitiesMBS for shortand derivative products. This paper discusses the development of prepayment models for pools of fixed-rate mortgages. The models are complete: calibrated functional forms are given for all of the factors that determine prepayment rates. Hence, the models can be used as benchmarks against the simple models of the Public Securities Association, the Federal Housing Administration experience, or the variety of projected prepayment rates generated by proprietary industry models.
