### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
This paper identifies four groups among 113 Fortune 500 manufacturers that approach innovation quite differently. The groups are based on 27 measured elements of corporate environment, corporate strategy, and formal and informal organization. Both product innovation and financial performance differ significantly over the groups, and a group of 42 firms that invest heavily in innovation perform best financially. A smaller group of firms that are not innovative but which follow a strategy of acquisition perform nearly as well financially. Firms focusing research resources on process innovation perform poorly, although process research complements product research among the effective innovators. Particularly important for explaining both product innovation and financial performance of these firms are salient combinations of classic elements of good environment, good strategy and good organizationstrong positions in growing markets, investment in research and development, open and creative organizational structures and supportive organizational climates.

## 2. Vector Computers, Monte Carlo Simulation and Regression Analysis: An Introduction
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
Vector computers provide a new tool for management scientists. The application of that tool requires thinking in vector mode. This mode is examined in the context of Monte Carlo experiments with regression models; these regression models may serve as metamodels in simulation experiments. The vector mode needs to exploit a specific dimension of the Monte Carlo experiment, namely the replicates of that experiment. Taking advantage of the machine architecture gives a code that computes Ordinary Least Squares estimates on a Cyber 205 in only 2% of the time needed on a Vax 8700. For Generalized Least Squares estimates, however, the code runs slower on the Cyber 205 than on the VAX, if the regression model is small; for large models the CYBER 205 runs much faster.

## 3. The Role of Inventory in Delivery-Time Competition
### Author(s):
- Lode Li
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
The paper operationalizes the notion of shortage cost by considering the behavior of customers and competing firms and examines the role of inventory in response time competition. We start with a single-firm production control model in which customers are characterized by their preferences of price, quality and delivery time. The optimal production/inventory policy and the optimal choice between make-to-order and make-to-stock operations are determined in simple newsboy-like formulas. The basic model is then extended to an n-firm market game in which firms compete for orders from the aspect of early delivery. One could think of this setting as an oligopoly racing market. The analysis shows that competition can breed a demand for produce-to-stock, just as other economic phenomena such as economies of scale, uncertainty, or seasonality can induce make-to-stock, and that delivery-time competition increases the buyer's welfare while decreasing the producer's welfare.

## 4. Hierarchical Planning for Probabilistic Distribution Systems in Euclidean Spaces
### Author(s):
- David Simchi-Levi
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
We develop an analytical model to assist the design and control of probabilistic distribution systems. These distribution systems are characterized by the explicit inclusion of probabilistic elements. The probabilistic aspect considered is that only a subset of all potential customers needs service on any given working day. This subset of customers and their demand are determined according to some probability distribution. The cost of operating such systems is significantly affected by decisions on the number and locations of the distribution centers, the allocation of customers to each center, and the routing strategy. We propose a three-stage hierarchical approach in which decisions about the number of centers and their locations (first stage), customers allocations (second stage) and routing strategies (third stage) are combined to reduce total system cost.

## 5. Locally Rational Decision Making: The Distracting Effect of Information on Managerial Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
This paper describes a phenomenon called locally rational decision-making, in which the mere presence of information may have dysfunctional consequences even if decision makers do not process the information incorrectly. Using the results from an experiment conducted with a strategic market simulation game, we find that the accessibility of information results in a disposition to focus on those components of decision-making most clearly addressed by the information. If these are not the components most closely tied to success, overall performance may in fact suffer. The decision-making process is thus locally rational since it may be optimal with respect to specific components of a larger plan, but globally suboptimal with regard to ultimate outcomes and for the organization as a whole. We describe the implications of the phenomenon for the use of market-related data in managerial decision-making.

## 6. Reducing Bias in a Personnel Assignment Process via Multiplicative Utility Solution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a type of bias which stems from the mathematical algorithm often used to determine an optimal match between two groups. We compare two different solution concepts for the matching assignment problem: the traditionally stable solution vs. a multiplicative utility approach that should avoid the bias. Simulation modeling leads us to conclude that: (1) With respect to all sizes compared in our experiment, applicants and employers groups were always treated far more equally under the multiplicative utility approach than the stable approach. (2) When using the stable algorithm, the size of the bias is affected by the size of the problem (i.e., the larger the problem size is the larger the performance discrepancy between two groups of participants). Further analyses of the sensitivity of the finding to different assumptions (e.g., correlation in the preference orderings of the two groups, or use of nonlinear conversion from ranks to utilities) also resulted in a superior performance of the multiplicative utility algorithm in terms of a more equitable outcome.

## 7. Dynamic Pricing and Ordering Decisions by a Monopolist
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers the relationship between pricing and ordering decisions for a monopolistic retailer facing a known demand function where, over the inventory cycle, the product may exhibit: (i) physical decay or deterioration of inventory called wastage; and (ii) decrease in market value called value drop associated with each unit of inventory on hand. The retailer is allowed to continuously vary the selling price of the product over the cycle. We introduce a notion of instantaneous margin, and use it to derive profit maximizing conditions for the retailer.

## 8. A Heuristic Ceiling Point Algorithm for General Integer Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Saltzman
- Frederick S. Hillier
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
This paper first examines the role of ceiling points in solving a pure, general integer linear programming problem (P). Several kinds of ceiling points are defined and analyzed and one kind called feasible 1-ceiling points proves to be of special interest. We demonstrate that all optimal solutions for a problem (P) whose feasible region is nonempty and bounded are feasible 1-ceiling points. Consequently, such a problem may be solved by enumerating just its feasible 1-ceiling points. The paper then describes an algorithm called the Heuristic Ceiling Point Algorithm (HCPA) which approximately solves (P) by searching only for feasible 1-ceiling points relatively near the optimal solution for the LP-relaxation; such solutions are apt to have a high (possibly even optimal) objective function value. The results of applying the HCPA to 48 test problems taken from the literature indicate that this approach usually yields a very good solution with a moderate amount of computational effort.

## 9. Decomposition and Nondifferentiable Optimization with the Projective Algorithm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1992
### Abstract:
This paper deals with an application of a variant of Karmarkar's projective algorithm for linear programming to the solution of a generic nondifferentiable minimization problem. This problem is closely related to the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition technique used in large-scale convex programming. The proposed method is based on a column generation technique defining a sequence of primal linear programming maximization problems. Associated with each problem one defines a weighted potential function which is minimized using a variant of the projective algorithm. When a point close to the minimum of the potential function is reached, a corresponding point in the dual space is constructed, which is close to the analytic center of a polytope containing the solution set of the nondifferentiable optimization problem. An admissible cut of the polytope, corresponding to a new supporting hyperplane of the epigraph of the function to minimize, is then generated at this approximate analytic center. In the primal space this new cut translates into a new column for the associated linear programming problem. The algorithm has performed well on a set of convex nondifferentiable programming problems.
