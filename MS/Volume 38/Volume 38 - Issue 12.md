### Abstract:
Recent advances in information technology and changes in social and economic relationships have led individual workers and organizations to explore various types of distributed work arrangements. This paper examines a specific type of distributed work arrangement, supplemental work at home. This arrangement refers to full-time employees doing job-related work at home in the evenings and on weekends. Based on a theoretical analysis of supplemental work, data gathered from a 346 computer-owners and 104 nonowners are empirically examined. The results suggest that the amount of time spent on supplemental work is positively related to work self-determination variables (flexibility and control), portability of work tasks, the availability of a telecommunications link between the firm and the home, and household income, and negatively related to commuting time and the presence of children at home. The paper discusses the implications of supplemental work for organizational design and the employer-employee relationship, It concludes that compared to other types of work at home, supplemental work is one remote work arrangement that is likely to persist, especially for professionals and managers.

## 2. Strategic Risk: An Ordinal Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
Strategic management researchers have shown increasing awareness of the importance of the concept of risk at the strategic level. In recognition of this interest, this research adopts a commonly used conceptualization of risk and shows how this conceptualization leads to a new measure of risk, based upon the chance of loss of relative position within a set of firms. This framework is shown to be particularly appropriate for strategy research. Information contained in probability distributions describing the relative positions of sets of firms over time is shown to be partitionable on the basis of gain or loss in position as well as on firm identity, leading to the derivation of a new measure of strategic risk for an individual firm. This development also provides a hierarchical quantification of risk at the levels of the industry, group and individual firm. The ordinal risk measure is applied to both hypothetical data for illustration and to data on the U.S. airline industry.

## 3. Empirical Analysis of Closed-Loop Duopoly Advertising Strategies
### Author(s):
- Gary M. Erickson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
Closed-loop (perfect) equilibria in a Lanchester duopoly differential game of advertising competition are used as the basis for empirical investigation. Two systems of simultaneous nonlinear equations are formed, one from a general Lanchester model and one from a constrained model. Two empirical applications are conducted. In one involving Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, a formal statistical testing procedure is used to detect whether closed-loop equilibrium advertising strategies are used by the competitors rather than open-loop strategies. In the second application, involving Anheuser-Busch and Miller, the general model is estimated. Results indicate that closed-loop equilibria better explain dynamic advertising competition than do open-loop equilibria. Also, closed-loop equilibrium advertising strategies implied by model estimates show that competitive advertising levels may or may not be monotonic in market share.

## 4. Minimizing Total Cost in Scheduling Outpatient Appointments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers various rules for scheduling appointments for medical clinic outpatients and investigates their ability to minimize a weighted sum of medical personnel's and patients' idle-time costs. It is shown that the idle times incurred by any given rule are affected by the following three environmental factors (in decreasing order of importance): the probability of no-show, the coefficient of variation of service times, and the number of patients per clinical session. Theoretically, an appropriate scheduling rule can be identified only if one knows the values of these parameters and the ratio between the medical personnel's and patients' idle-time costs.

## 5. Simulation Designs for Quadratic Response Surface Models in the Presence of Model Misspecification
### Author(s):
- Joan M. Donohue
- Ernest C. Houck
- Raymond H. Myers
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
This article considers the selection of experimental designs for the estimation of second-order response surface metamodels in a simulation environment. Rather than construct designs based on the premise that the postulated model exactly represents the simulated response, as is the case in optimal design theory, we assume that the estimation process may be biased by the presence of unfitted third-order terms. We therefore seek to specify experimental plans that address the bias due to possible model misspecification as well as traditional variance considerations. The performance measure used for this fit-protect scenario is Box and Draper's design criterion of average mean squared error of predicted response. Four important classes of response surface experimental plans are examined: (1) central composite designs, (2) Box-Behnken plans, (3) three-level factorial experiments, and (4) small central composite designs. Each design class is studied in conjunction with three pseudorandom number assignment strategies: (1) the use of a unique set of streams at each design point; (2) the assignment of a common stream set to all experimental points: and (3) the simultaneous use of common and antithetic streams through design blocking. Comparisons of both design classes and assignment strategies are presented to assist the user in the selection of an appropriate experimental strategy.

## 6. Optimal Workload Allocation in Open Networks of Multiserver Queues
### Author(s):
- Joel M. Calabrese
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
In this paper, we examine the general problem of workload allocation in an open Jackson network of multiserver queues. We show that use of the open network model leads to a separable, convex formulation of the problem with relatively simple optimality conditions. Using these conditions, we prove in general that server groups with the same number of servers should be loaded equally and larger groups should be loaded more heavily than smaller groups. It is also shown that server pooling, combining servers into larger groups, will always reduce congestion and/or increase throughput. We discuss the significance of our results for job shop applications and also for the concept of a production bottleneck. In systems with an unbalanced configuration of servers, traditional, deterministic bottleneck analysis is distinctly nonoptimal; our results provide a simple way to locate production bottlenecks in shops with significant queueing effects.

## 7. A Branch-and-Bound Procedure for the Multiple Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Erik Demeulemeester
- Willy Herroelen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
In this paper a branch-and-bound procedure is described for scheduling the activities of a project of the PERT/CPM variety subject to precedence and resource constraints where the objective is to minimize project duration. The procedure is based on a depth-first solution strategy in which nodes in the solution tree represent resource and precedence feasible partial schedules. Branches emanating from a parent node correspond to exhaustive and minimal combinations of activities, the delay of which resolves resource conflicts at each parent node. Precedence and resource-based bounds described in the paper are combined with new dominance pruning rules to rapidly fathom major portions of the solution tree. The procedure is programmed in the C language for use on both a mainframe and a personal computer. The procedure has been validated using a standard set of test problems with between 7 and 50 activities requiring up to three resource types each. Computational experience on a personal computer indicates that the procedure is 11.6 times faster than the most rapid solution procedure reported in the literature while requiring less computer storage. Moreover, problems requiring large amounts of computer time using existing approaches for solving this problem type are rapidly solved with our procedure using the dominance rules described, resulting in a significant reduction in the variability in solution times as well.

## 8. NoteModeling Coordination in Organizations and Markets
### Author(s):
- Neil B. Niman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1992
### Abstract:
In an earlier issue of Management Science, Thomas Malone (1987) utilizes the concept of vulnerability costs in order to compare the degree of flexibility exhibited by markets and hierarchies. The purpose of this note is to redefine the concept of vulnerability to include the corresponding opportunity costs that are created when a coordinating structure restricts the ability to adjust to a change in market conditions. The conclusion reached is that those structures experiencing the lowest opportunity costs are the least vulnerable, and can therefore be classified as the most flexible.
