## 1. Estimating Loyalty and Switching with an Application to the Automobile Market

### Published:

### Abstract:
A brand switching model that considers the choices: previous choice, current choice, and substitute choice, if the current choice were not available, is developed and estimated. An important assumption of the model is that the market consists of two types of consumers: Loyals and Shoppers. The model provides estimates for: (1) the proportion of Loyals in a submarket, and (2) the success of each submarket in capturing Shoppers. We illustrate how the model can be used to characterize the competitive structure of a market. We also show how the estimated parameters of the model can be validated using simulation and a theoretically derived covariance matrix.

## 2. Rule-Based Forecasting: Development and Validation of an Expert Systems Approach to Combining Time Series Extrapolations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
This paper examines the feasibility of rule-based forecasting, a procedure that applies forecasting expertise and domain knowledge to produce forecasts according to features of the data. We developed a rule base to make annual extrapolation forecasts for economic and demographic time series. The development of the rule base drew upon protocol analyses of five experts on forecasting methods. This rule base, consisting of 99 rules, combined forecasts from four extrapolation methods (the random walk, regression, Brown's linear exponential smoothing, and Holt's exponential smoothing) according to rules using 18 features of time series. For one-year ahead ex ante forecasts of 90 annual series, the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) for rule-based forecasting was 13% less than that from equally-weighted combined forecasts. For six-year ahead ex ante forecasts, rule-based forecasting had a MdAPE that was 42% less. The improvement in accuracy of the rule-based forecasts over equally-weighted combined forecasts was statistically significant. Rule-based forecasting was more accurate than equal-weights combining in situations involving significant trends, low uncertainty, stability, and good domain expertise.

## 3. Multivariate Batch Means and Control Variates
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
We consider applying the nonoverlapping batch means output analysis method in conjunction with the control-variate variance-reduction technique to estimate a steady-state multivariate mean vector. The effects of the number of batches and the number of control variates on the multivariate point and region estimators and the univariate point and interval estimators are considered. The results are experiment analysis guidelines in terms of an appropriate range of the number of batches to choose as a function of the number of responses and control variates. The results have implications for terminating simulations as well.

## 4. Improving Monte Carlo Efficiency by Increasing Variance
### Author(s):
- G. S. Fishman
- V. G. Kulkarni
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
This paper compares the performances of two well-known Monte Carlo procedures for estimating an unknown quantity as the size of the problem grows. One method based on the standard Monte Carlo approach generates K i.i.d. data points. The other derives its data from a single K-step sample path generated by a Markov chain. The paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Markov chain approach to perform more efficiently than the standard Monte Carlo approach does. Moreover, it identifies circumstances under which this better efficiency grows with increasing problem size. This improved efficiency comes from reduced sample generating and function evaluating costs in the Markov chain approach that more than compensate for the increased variance of the estimator that the Markov chain sampling approach induces when compared to the standard Monte Carlo approach. Several examples illustrate how the benefits arise; one also demonstrates a case in which the standard Monte Carlo approach becomes increasingly preferred as the problem size grows.

## 5. Top Team Deterioration as Part of the Downward Spiral of Large Corporate Bankruptcies
### Author(s):
- Donald C. Hambrick
- Richard A. D'Aveni
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
This exploratory study of 57 large bankruptcies and 57 matched survivors examined the top management team (TMT) characteristics associated with major corporate failure. Prior research was used to guide selection of specific team characteristics for study. Not only did the failing firms show significant annual, or cross-sectional, divergence from survivors on several indicators of TMT composition, but also those divergences became more pronounced, even accelerating, over the last five years of the bankrupts' lives. The results thus suggest that deterioration of the top management team is a central element of the downward spiral of large corporate failures. Based upon a limited test of causality, the authors propose that a two-way process is at work: (1) team deficiencies bring about or aggravate corporate deterioration, either through strategic errors or stakeholder uneasiness with the flawed team; and (2) corporate deterioration brings about team deterioration, through a combination of voluntary departures, scapegoating, and limited resources for attracting new executive talent.

## 6. Optimal Cycle Times in Multistage Serial Systems with Set-Up and Inventory Costs
### Author(s):
- Iftekhar A. Karimi
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
Scheduling of multistage serial production systems under constant demand and infinite horizon is considered. The production stages operate with periodic shut-downs and startups. An integer nonlinear programming formulation is presented for determining a stationary, cyclic schedule with no stock-outs in any inventory and minimum sum of set-up and inventory costs. It allows a lot-sizing policy involving arbitrary, noninteger splitting/merging of lots. Three, almost optimal, heuristic algorithms and an exact branch and bound algorithm are developed using analytical results. Their evaluation using simulated problems shows the branch and bound algorithm to be the best, as it is fast even for systems with as many as 11 stages.

## 7. Feasibility of Scheduling Lot Sizes of Three Products on One Machine
### Author(s):
- Celia A. Glass
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers the Economic Lot Scheduling Problem: that is, the problem of finding a feasible schedule that allows cyclic production of several products on a single facility so as to minimize holding and set up costs. We consider the case when three products are required to be produced in a given fixed lot size and at regular intervals. We derive a very simple test for existence of a feasible schedule and a method of constructing feasible schedules if one exists. The approach is simpler than the mixed integer programming approach and enumeration schemes currently proposed in the literature and is constructive.

## 8. New Search Spaces for Sequencing Problems with Application to Job Shop Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Storer

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
In this paper search heuristics are developed for generic sequencing problems with emphasis on job shop scheduling. The proposed methods integrate problem specific heuristics common to Operations Research and local search approaches from Artificial Intelligence in order to obtain desirable properties from both. The applicability of local search to a wide range of problems, and the incorporation of problem-specific information are both properties of the proposed algorithms. Two methods are proposed, both of which are based on novel definitions of solution spaces and of neighborhoods in these spaces. Applications of the proposed methodology are developed for job shop scheduling problems, and can be easily applied with any scheduling objective. To demonstrate effectiveness, the method is tested on the job shop scheduling problem with the minimum makespan objective. Encouraging results are obtained.

## 9. File and Work Transfers in Cyclic Queue Systems
### Author(s):
- D. Sarkar
- W. I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1992
### Abstract:
A cyclic queue has one server and n nodes, where each node has its own distinct type of customers that arrive from the outside. The server visits the nodes cyclically, serving the customers first at node 1, then at node 2, and so on through node n, and then repeating from node 1 again. Setup times are incurred when the server switches nodes.
