## 1. Pooling in Two-Location Inventory Systems with Non-Negligible Replenishment Lead Times
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper deals with the analysis of two-location periodic review inventory systems with non-negligible replenishment lead times. Emergency transshipments are used in these systems as a recourse action to reduce the occurrence of shortages. A class of partial pooling policies is proposed for the control of transshipments. The cost performance of this class of policies is shown to be inferior to that of complete pooling. An approximate model and a heuristic algorithm are introduced to compute near-optimal stocking policy solutions. Comparisons with simulation results verify the satisfactory performance of the approximate model and algorithm. Numerical sensitivity analysis provides additional insight into the nature of optimal transshipment behavior.

### Abstract:
Traditional statistical process control charts assume that observations are independent and normally distributed about some mean. We investigate the robustness of traditional charts to data correlation when the correlation can be described by an ARMA(1,1) model. We compare the performance of the Shewhart chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart to the performance of the Special-Cause Control (SCC) chart and the Common-Cause Control (CCC) chart proposed by Alwan and Roberts (1988), which are designed to account for data correlation. We also explore the possibility of putting limits on the CCC chart, in order to predict quality abnormalities. The measure of performance used is the average run length (ARL). The results show that the ability of the EWMA chart to detect shifts in the process mean is quite robust to data correlation, while the corresponding individuals Shewhart chart rarely detects such shifts more quickly than the other charts. The SCC and CCC charts are shown to be preferred in most cases when a shift in the process mean exceeds 2 standard deviations. The experimental results can aid practitioners in deciding which chart would be most effective at detecting specified shifts in the process mean given the nature of their particular correlated environments. Two methodologies are utilized to explain the relative performance of the SPC charts compared: the dynamic step response function, and response surface methodology. Such methods not only facilitate a discussion of our results, but also make it possible to predict the relative performance of the charts when the process can be described by a model which is more complex than the ARMA(1,1) model.

## 3. Conditional Monitoring Policy Under Moral Hazard
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
This paper extends the previous research on conditional monitoring by allowing the principal to choose the level of monitoring investment and by finding the properties of an interior optimal monitoring policy which is not of a bang-bang nature. We show that, under a concave monitoring technology, the optimal monitoring investment is decreasing in the observed outcome and lower-tailed in a variety of contexts.

## 4. Pricing and Capacity Decisions for a Service Facility: Stability and Multiple Local Optima
### Author(s):
- Shaler Stidham
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
We consider a model for optimal pricing and capacity for a service facility. The problem is formulated as one of optimal design of a single-server queueing system, in which the design variables are the service rate and the arrival rate (equivalently, the price charged for admission). The model is a variant of one introduced by Dewan and Mendelson. We allow for an upper bound on the arrival rate and consider slightly more general user value functions. We show that an optimal solution may not lie in the interior of the feasible region and thus may not be characterized by the first-order differential conditions. Moreover, the first-order conditions typically have several solutions, some of which may be relative minima and produce a negative value of the objective function (customer value minus the sum of expected delay cost and capacity cost per unit time). We also examine the stability of the equilibrium arrival rate and the convergence of a dynamic adaptive algorithm for finding the optimal service rate, in the context of a model in which the distribution of customers' value of service is uniform. We show that the equilibrium arrival rate is stable if and only if the service rate is above a threshold value, which depends on the price charged for admission and the parameters of the uniform distribution of value of service. The dynamic, adaptive algorithm always converges to a relative maximum of the objective function if the service rate can be adjusted every time the arrival rate changes. Otherwise, the algorithm will start to diverge if and when the service rate ever falls below the threshold value associated with stability of the equilibrium arrival rate.

## 5. A Two-Echelon Inventory System with Priority Shipments
### Author(s):
- Maqbool Dada
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
A two-echelon system for spare parts is analyzed. The system allows the use of priority inventory pooling to expedite service when a stock-out occurs. First, a tractable aggregate model is derived. This model is then disaggregated to approximate the performance of the exact system. Results of computer tests are also presented.

## 6. Optimal Service Speeds in a Competitive Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
This is a study of the economic behavior of vendors of service in competition. A simple model with two competing exponential servers and Poisson arrivals is considered. Each server is free to choose his own service rate at a cost (per time unit) that is strictly convex and increasing. There is a fixed reward to a server for each customer that he serves. The model is designed to study one specific aspect of competition, namely, competition in speed of service as a means for capturing a larger market share in order to maximize long-run expected profit per time unit. A two-person strategic game is formulated and its solutions are characterized. Depending on the revenue per customer served and on the cost of maintaining service rates, the following three situations may arise: (i) a unique symmetric strategic (Nash) equilibrium in which expected waiting time is infinite; (ii) a unique symmetric strategic equilibrium in which expected waiting time is finite; and (iii) several, nonsymmetric strategic equilibria with infinite expected waiting time. An explicit expression for the market share of each server as a function of the service rates of the two servers is also given.

## 7. Regression Metamodels for Simulation with Common Random Numbers: Comparison of Validation Tests and Confidence Intervals
### Author(s):
- Jack P. C. Kleijnen
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
Linear regression analysis is important in many fields. In the analysis of simulation results, a regression (meta)model can be applied, even when common pseudorandom numbers are used. To test the validity of the specified regression model, Rao (1959) generalized the F statistic for lack of fit, whereas Kleijnen (1983) proposed a cross-validation procedure using a Student's t statistic combined with Bonferroni's inequality. This paper reports on an extensive Monte Carlo experiment designed to compare these two methods. Under the normality assumption, cross-validation is conservative, whereas Rao's test realizes its nominal type I error and has high power. Robustness is investigated through lognormal and uniform distributions. When simulation responses are distributed lognormally, then cross-validation using Ordinary Least Squares is the only technique that has acceptable type I error. Uniform distributions give results similar to the normal case. Once the regression model is validated, confidence intervals for the individual regression parameters are computed. The Monte Carlo experiment compares several confidence interval procedures. Under normality, Rao's procedure is preferred since it has good coverage probability and acceptable half-length. Under lognormality, Ordinary Least Squares achieves nominal coverage probability. Uniform distributions again give results similar to the normal case.

## 8. A Multiple-Objective Programming Technique for Structuring Tax-Exempt Serial Revenue Debt Issues
### Author(s):
- Amy v. Puelz
- Sang M. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
A multiple-objective decision model to structure tax-exempt serial revenue bonds is presented in this paper. Based on goals dealing with true interest cost, marketability, debt coverage, production, and level debt, we define a goal programming model to generate a maturity schedule and coupon rate assignment for a municipal bond issue. The model is designed to be a flexible interactive decision making tool to aid in the development of a minimal-risk, cost-effective issue.

## 9. An Integrated Model for Job-Shop Planning and Scheduling
### Author(s):
- J. B. Lasserre
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1992
### Abstract:
We consider an integrated job-shop planning and scheduling model. To solve the problem we use a (multi-pass) decomposition approach which alternates between solving a planning problem with a fixed sequence of products on the machines, and a job-shop scheduling problem for a fixed choice of the production plan. The generated production plans are feasible i.e., there exists at least one feasible schedule to realize that plan. Quality of the solution is investigated and numerical results are presented.
