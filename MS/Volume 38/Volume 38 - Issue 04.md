### Abstract:
File migration shows promise as a means of improving data processing performance in distributed systems, but practical application of this idea will require development of effective policies that will allow a system to fully realize the potentials of file migration. Deriving of optimal policies, while computationally complex, nevertheless, is essential to provide insights about how effective migration policies for large systems should be structured. In this paper, analytic properties and performance of optimal file migration policies are investigated based on a Markov decision process model of file migration policies. Optimal migration policies are compared with optimal static policies and the sufficient conditions under which file migration provides absolute improvement or no advantage over static policies are presented. Numerical experiments and simulations were performed to analyze the impact of model assumptions and system parameters on the cost improvement generated by file migration. It is shown that optimal file migration is able to generate substantial cost improvement under certain conditions and that it is robust both with respect to the initial file allocation at an initial system design/reorganization point and to impreciseness of system environments. This analysis should provide system designers and administrators guidance toward achieving effective file migration control.

## 2. Signals and Choices in a Competitive Interaction: The Role of Moves and Messages
### Author(s):
- Marian Chapman Moore
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1992
### Abstract:
This study examines the effect of signals from a competitor on the decisions of managers in a situation of strategic interdependence. The context is a multi-period pricing simulation and the payoffs are structured in accordance with a Prisoner's Dilemma. The signals consist of messages from the competitor and observations of the pricing decisions made by the competitor. The managers' responses to particular types of signals and particular combinations of moves and messages change over the course of the simulation. Suggestions for future research on competitive signaling are offered.

## 3. Analytical Evaluation of Multi-Criteria Heuristics
### Author(s):
- Richard L. Daniels
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of evaluating the solution quality of multi-criteria heuristics. By assuming an additive multi-attribute value structure, efficient and heuristic solutions can be translated into value measures that depend only on the relative importance assigned to the criteria of interest. Approximation errors are then defined as the value penalty incurred by approximating an efficient solution with its heuristic alternative. Results are derived which can be used to eliminate solutions that cannot represent the best available alternative among the set of efficient and heuristic solutions. For the bicriterion case, a polynomial algorithm for determining the mean and maximum relative heuristic error for a given problem instance is presented. For more general multi-criteria problems, the maximum relative approximation error can be determined by solving a series of linear programming problems.

## 4. R&D Cooperation Between FirmsA Perceived Transaction Cost Perspective
### Author(s):
- Klaus Brockhoff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1992
### Abstract:
Transaction cost is considered as an explanatory variable for the choice between markets and various organizational arrangements for performing some predefined tasks, such as engaging in private R&D. With respect to R&D cooperation between firms, we show that the perception of high transaction cost is related to certain characteristics of the firm and to the type of R&D task. We also show a relationship between the perception of transaction cost and the perceived success of the cooperation. The analysis sheds light on various determinants of transaction costs.

## 5. Deterministic Capacity Expansion Under Deterioration
### Author(s):
- S. Rajagopalan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1992
### Abstract:
This paper considers the deterministic capacity expansion problem with deterioration. First, the paper extends the conventional model by incorporating capacity deterioration effects and operating costs that are a function of: (i) the age of the facility and (ii) the extent of utilization of capacity. The model still has the useful properties of the standard model, enabling the use of efficient algorithms. Second, the paper extends well-known planning horizon results to this model using a novel dual-based approach, which also provides additional intuition. Finally, interesting computational results are provided that compare optimal and near-optimal forecast horizon values. The impact of capacity deterioration and convexity in variable costs on forecast horizons is also considered.

### Abstract:
This paper studies a problem of determining the level of certain decisions, taken prior to certain events taking place, and the subsequent additional resource procurement decisions needed to implement the initial program once these events have materialised.

### Author(s):

### Abstract:
While Stochastic Dominance has been employed in various forms as early as 1932, it has only been since 19691970 that the notion has been developed and extensively employed in the area of economics, finance, agriculture, statistics, marketing and operations research.

## 8. A New Graph-Theoretic Heuristic for Facility Layout
### Author(s):
- Janny Leung
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1992
### Abstract:
The facility layout problem is important in the modern manufacturing environment because increased machine flexibility and product diversification create additional complexities in scheduling and material handling. An important first step in facility layout is the determination of which machines should be adjacent. This problem can be modelled as that of finding a maximum weight planar subgraph of a graph, given a measure of the desirability that two machines be adjacent based on the anticipated flows and technological constraints. We present a new heuristic that is a generalization of previous work of Foulds and Robinson. Preliminary computational results are presented which suggest that this heuristic performs well.
