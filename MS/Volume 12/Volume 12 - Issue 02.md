## 1. Foreword
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1965
### Abstract:
In the Foreword to the First Issue of Series B (February, 1965) the viewpoint was reiterated that this journal should “appeal to managers concerned with ‘the role that science can play in management.'” The article by C. W. Churchman and A. H. Schainblatt seems to be definitely directed towards this aim. The questions arising out of consideration of relations between “the researcher and the manager” are of genuine interest, certainly, to the manager and to many researchers who recognize that the vitality of their field rests on a continuing interest on the part of the manager. Furthermore the need for implementation affects the researcher as well as the manager. There seems to be no doubt that The Researcher and the Manager: A Dialectic of Implementation is a genuinely important subject for readers of this journal.

### Abstract:
Comments about Churchman, C. W., A. H. Schainblatt. 1965. The researcher and the manager: A dialectic of implementation. Management Sci.11 (4) B-69–B-87. The purpose of this paper is to review various opinions and differences of opinion which have been expressed concerning that aspect of research referred to as “implementation.” We have used the term “implementation” to refer to the manner in which the results of scientific effort may come to be used by the manager. The “problem of implementation” is the problem of determining what activities of the scientist and the manager are most appropriate to bring about an effective relationship between the two.

### Author(s):
- Donald E. Ladd
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1965
### Abstract:
On April 5, 1965 the members of a class in Studies in Operations Research were presented with statements (appended) concerning the relationship of the scientist in industry with the industrial manager. There were four such statements, presented in written form, one at a time and in orders which differed for each individual. For each statement, the members were asked only to note whether they agreed or disagreed.

## 15. On Mutual Understanding
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1965
### Abstract:
The breadth and scope of the reactions to our implementation paper are very gratifying. We, of course, had selected workers likely to be interested in our problem. What we had not expected was the emergence of so many parallelisms between our treatment of the problem of implementation and those of a wide range of investigations in the broad reaches of management decision theory.

## 17. A General Model for Exponentially Compounding and Discounting Future Cash Flows
### Author(s):
- William W. Thompson, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1965
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general model to be used in adjusting cash flows which occur over future time intervals to reflect the effects of continuous compounding and/or discounting. The method is illustrated by means of a hypothetical example. The framework of analysis employed here may be extended to other systems having similar characteristics of growth and decay.
