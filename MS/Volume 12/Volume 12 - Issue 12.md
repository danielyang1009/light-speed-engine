## 1. Stochastic Models of Behavior
### Author(s):
- William J. Horvath
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
The Management scientist must understand the various processes leading to regularities in human behavior. When man-machine combinations are involved such regularities are usually a consequence of the mechanical limitations of the machinery. Less well known but equally important are certain statistical regularities which appear in mass behavior. Recent research in the societal sciences has demonstrated behavioral regularities in such diverse fields of human endeavor as information processing, problem solving, group interactions and learning. The underlying cause behind these observed phenomena is not always obvious but can be ascribed partly to limitations in the human organism and partly to the structuring of the environment in which the behavior is observed. Whatever the theoretical basis for the observed behavior, the regularities provide the management scientist with the necessary predictability of behavior needed for his studies. Two examples of recent research in this area are discussed in this paper. One is a group formation model proposed by Coleman and James and the second is a group interaction model first studied by Bales. Both of these are representative of a broad class of models which the management scientist should be able to incorporate in his work.

## 2. Long Range Planning in Mental Health
### Author(s):
- Robert J. Hunter
- Jerome E. Schnee
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
As a result of federal mental health grants-in-aid of 4.2 million dollars to support comprehensive mental health planning in the states, Pennsylvania initiated the development of a Comprehensive Mental Health Plan in mid-1963. This comprehensive plan concerns itself with the development of short and long range goals for a mental health program concerned with the needs of all the citizens of the state.

## 3. A Dynamic Model for Competitive Marketing in Coupled Markets
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
A dynamic model is developed for competitive marketing situations involving products whose markets are coupled. By coupling it is meant that advertising dollars spent in generating sales for one product have an influence on the sales of another product. A game-theory approach is taken, and noncooperative equilibrium solutions for advertising expenditures are developed. Effectiveness is measured by weighted future profits. Various aspects of model building for coupled markets are discussed. The present dynamic model treats any number of competitors and products. It thus extends previous work by the author on a two competitor, two product, static model for coupled markets.

## 4. Forecasting Peak Demand for an Electric Utility with a Hybrid Exponential Model
### Author(s):
- Gordon K. C. Chen
- Peter R. Winters
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
The paper discusses forecasting peak load demand, one day in advance, for an electric utility, but its main purpose is to illustrate the combination of the exponential adaptation principle with modified rules-of-thumb being successfully used by the electric company. The results indicate that although the company is already doing a good forecasting job, the hybrid exponential model, in simplest form, does even better, although it uses only a portion of the data that is available and used by the company.

## 5. A New Approach to Stockout Penalties
### Author(s):
- Benjamin L. Schwartz
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
Classical inventory theory considers that stockouts generate penalty costs to the firm, often assumed to be proportional to the excess of demand over supply. While such a concept is sometimes appropriate, it does not correctly reflect the effect of loss of goodwill. The latter is characterized by the fact that a disappointed customer reacts in the future to change his purchasing habits. Thus the nature of the effect is that subsequent demand is perturbed, a phenomenon quite different from having an immediate penalty cost imposed. Models with this property are termed perturbed demand, abbreviated PD.

## 6. The Bond Refunding Decision as a Markov Process
### Author(s):
- Harold Bierman, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
Corporations that issue long-term debt are frequently faced with the opportunity to call the bonds and issue new bonds at more advantageous interest rates. When the current interest rate falls below the contractual interest rate on the outstanding debt, then computations must be made to evaluate the desirability of the refunding decision. This paper investigates the possibility of introducing the probabilities of different interest rates in the future, thus considering the desirability of postponing the refunding as well as the desirability of refunding now.

## 7. Optimal Depreciation Strategies for Income Tax Purposes
### Author(s):
- B. Alva Schoomer, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
Among the items on a corporate income statement, depreciation and amortization are unique in that while they are legitimate expenses, and therefore deductible for tax purposes, they are non-cash items. Thus, the tax savings which result from reporting depreciation may be retained by the company for investment. If the funds thus generated can be invested profitably, a substantial increase in corporate profitability can result. Typically, this component of the total cash flow of an industrial corporation is two or three times as large as retained corporate earnings.

## 9. Why Only Few Operations Researchers Manage
### Author(s):
- A. G. Beged-Dov
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1966
### Abstract:
Discussed are some issues which were raised at a session devoted to OR education at the 1964 TIMS-ES Joint European Conference. The central contention of this paper is that the single most reliable indicator of how effective is OR is the proportion of operations researchers who eventually attain general management responsibilities. The main obstacles standing in the way of conducting superior Operations Research are discussed. It is claimed that certain alarming developments in the practice and education of Operations Research must be arrested. Otherwise, the discipline will not be able to effectively solve the more challenging problems of business and society.
