## 1. An Analysis of Criteria for Investment and Financing Decisions Under Certainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to investigate the decision-making procedure for accepting or rejecting investment or financing alternatives available to the firm. The properties of the decision rules based on discounted present value and internal rate of return are studied for the class of projects described by a finite sequence of cash flows. The necessary and sufficient conditions under which the decision rules lead to unique solutions are derived. Where the decision rule does not provide a unique solution, it is necessary to define two rates: the project investment rate and the project financing rate. The extension of the project analysis in terms of the two rates permits the derivation of unambiguous decision rules for all projects. The relevance of the results is discussed in the summary.

## 2. Weighting Multiple Criteria
### Author(s):
- Robert T. Eckenrode
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
Six methods for collecting the judgments of experts concerning the relative value of sets of criteria were compared for their reliability and time efficiency. The methods were ranking, rating, three versions of paired comparisons and a method of successive comparisons suggested by Churchman, Ackoff and Arnoff [Churchman, C. W., R. L. Ackoff, E. L. Arnoff. 1957. Introduction to Operations Research. Wiley, New York.]. The judgment situations used were concerned with the design of a specific air defense system and a general air defense system, and with selecting a personnel subsystem manager for a development program. In each of these three situations six criteria were comparatively evaluated by the judges. The results of these experiments showed that there were no significant differences in the sets of criterion weights derived from collecting the judgment data by any of the methods, but that ranking was by far the most efficient method. A fourth experiment was conducted to develop baseline data on the time required to make comparative judgments vs. number of items to be judged, by the ranking method and by the simplest paired comparisons method. Ranking is increasingly more efficient than paired comparisons as the number of items to be judged increases from six to 30.

## 3. Capital Accumulation and Production for the Firm: Optimal Dynamic Policies
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Iglehart
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a firm that must make a production decision and a capital decision at periodic intervals of time. The cost of production is assumed to be convex and the firm is allowed to hold inventories. For a class of inventory and capital costs the optimal production and capital decisions are obtained for an n-period problem. The optimality criterion used is minimization of the expected present value of costs in the n periods.

## 4. Optimal Policy for a Multi-Product, Dynamic, Nonstationary Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with a multi-product dynamic nonstationary inventory problem in which the system is reviewed at the beginning of each of a sequence of periods of equal length. The model has the following features. There is a general demand process with no stationarity or independence assumptions, partial or complete backlogging of unfilled demand, a fixed non-negative delivery lag (which may be positive only under complete backlogging), a nonstationary linear ordering cost, a nonstationary holding and shortage cost function, discounting of future costs, and nonstationary restrictions like budget and storage limitations. The objective is to choose an ordering policy that minimizes the expected discounted costs over an infinite time horizon. Conditions are given that ensure that the base stock ordering policy is optimal and that the base stock levels in each period are easy to calculate.

## 5. A Dynamic Analysis of a Class of Deteriorating Systems
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Eppen
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
This paper considers a model for the maintenance of a deteriorating system with a discrete state space. At discrete points in time a sequence of maintenance decisions is to be made. These decisions are either to leave the system in its present state, or by performing maintenance to place it in a “higher state.” Between maintenance visits the behavior of the system is described by a stationary Markov matrix. For a maintenance cost c·z (where z is the number of states by which the system is improved) and a convex one-period operating cost L(·) a class of transition matrices is found which lead to simple maintenance policies. It is also shown that the restrictions on the transition matrix are not only sufficient but “almost necessary” if the result is to hold for all possible choices of L(·).

## 6. The Direct Power of Adjacent Vertex Programming Methods
### Author(s):
- B. Martos
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
How far does the power of the adjacent vertex methods extend in solving non-linear programming problems? This question here gets a partial answer, being restricted to variables and objective functions which are continuous and excluding any transformation or approximation of the original system. The underlying concepts are that of quasi-concavity and quasi-monotonicity. Necessary and sufficient characteristics of the family of objective functions are given in due generality although in some cases subject to several differentiability assumptions. For these latter cases a simple criterion of vector selection is presented. Finally the problem of linear fractional programming is briefly discussed as an example.

## 7. Integer Programming: Methods, Uses, Computations
### Author(s):
- M. L. Balinski
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
This paper attempts to present the major methods, successful or interesting uses, and computational experience relating to integer or discrete programming problems. Included are descriptions of general algorithms for solving linear programs in integers, as well as some special purpose algorithms for use on highly structured problems. This reflects a belief, on the author's part, that various clever methods of enumeration and other specialized approaches are the most efficacious means existent by which to obtain solutions to practical problems. A serious try at gathering computational experience has been made—but facts are difficult to uncover.

## 8. Communication to the Editor—A Note on Krone's Economic Lot-Size Formulas
### Author(s):
- James A. Parsons
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1965
### Abstract:
When many products are to be manufactured on the same production facility we can avoid product interference, and thus obtain a feasible production schedule, by requiring all products to have the same cycle time T. In this way Krone, [Krone, L. H. Jr. 1964. A note on economic lot-sizes for multipurpose equipment. Management Sci.10 (3, April).], develops formulas for determining economic lot-sizes for multipurpose equipment. The author treats the case where backorders are permissible with a cost of backorder proportional to the length of time for which the backorder exists. The purpose of this note is to include a fixed cost of backorder into the formulas.
