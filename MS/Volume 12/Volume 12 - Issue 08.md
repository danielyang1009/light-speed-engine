## 1. A Utility Function Derived from a Survival Game
### Author(s):
- Karl Borch
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
The starting point of the paper is a firm engaged in a risky business. It is assumed that the firm's gain in each operating period is a stochastic variable. It is further assumed that these stochastic variables are independent and identically distributed. If the capital of the firm becomes negative, the firm is ruined, and must go out of business.

## 2. On the Efficient Use of High Aswan Dam for Hydropower and Irrigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
With, the completion of the High Aswan Dam it will be possible to use the water of the Nile River in many different ways for different beneficial purposes. The selection of the best method of operating the dam and developing new resources to speed economic growth and social progress is of great importance to the United Arab Republic. A large sustained multidisciplinary effort combining economic analysis, engineering design, and governmental planning will be required. It is the purpose of this paper to describe some analytical methods that will be useful in this undertaking. A mathematical model for computer studies is developed to elucidate and quantify the relations between the variables pertaining to agricultural and power uses. Other functions of the dam such as flood protection and improvement of navigation are not examined in this initial study. However, it will be possible to investigate them in a more comprehensive model using similar mathematical methods. In its present form the model is designed to use standard linear programs so that operations studies can be made without recourse to sophisticated computer techniques. The model incorporates some of the chief factors affecting efficiency of multipurpose operation for the generation of hydroelectric power and for increasing the agricultural production of the United Arab Republic. The formulation provides a logical framework on which other functions may be added at a later stage. In the last section of this paper some of the most important modifications and elaborations are discussed.

## 3. Optimization of Seismic Reconnaissance Surveys in Petroleum Exploration
### Author(s):
- Jerrold M. Pachman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
The seismic reflection method employed in petroleum exploration is described, after which the problem of selecting the optimum cell size for a uniform rectangular seismic reconnaissance search pattern is stated in terms of elementary search theory. The search effectiveness for each pattern is estimated by a Monte Carlo approach due to the probabilistic nature of target geometry. The problem of allocating a limited amount of search effort to a number of regions to be searched simultaneously is formulated as a dynamic programming problem in which the decision variables are the search pattern parameters and the inter-shot point spacing along the survey lines. The approach is easily generalized so that pattern morphology and orientation also become decision variables.

## 4. A Decision Theory Approach to Portfolio Selection
### Author(s):
- James C. T. Mao
- Carl Erik Särndal
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
This paper starts with a brief summary of Harry Markowitz's portfolio selection model and proceeds to reformulate it within the framework of modern statistical decision theory. The future returns from securities are viewed as a function of the unknown state of nature. The investor has certain a priori probabilities for the different states of nature, which probabilities he later modifies in the light of new experimental information. Following the Bayesian strategy, the investor chooses that portfolio of securities which maximizes the weighted average of payoffs, using as weights the a posteriori probabilities of the states of nature. A computer program, based on the critical line method, is used to solve a simple illustrative problem.

## 5. Uncertainty and its Effect on Capital Investment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Martin B. Solomon, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
When uncertainty concerning costs, revenues, and project life exists, classical measures of capital investment return are limited in value. Sensitivity analysis indicates that relatively small over estimates and under estimates create relatively large errors in the discounted rate of return for different types of return schedules. Perhaps, then, businessmen are justified in seeking other methods of project evaluation.

## 6. Applying a Model of Organization Structure to the Analysis of a Wood Products Market
### Author(s):
- Kenneth D. Mackenzie
- George D. Frazier
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of the set theoretic model of organizations developed by Mackenzie in the study of complex market organizations. Part one briefly outlines the mathematical development of Mackenzie's model. Part two describes the organization and structure of the wood products market in Los Angles within the framework of this model.

## 7. A Chance-Constrained Model for Real-Time Control in Research and Development Management
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- A. C. Stedry
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
Funding of research projects is considered as encompassing three stages: (1) an initial short run plan for funding based upon projected regular demands and availability subject to random deviations; (2) adjustment of the initial plan to take into account the actual regular demands and availability and the funding of significant break-throughs which occur at random intervals preempting other demands; and (3) a plan for longer-run availability and demands which constitute a “posture” desired subsequent to the funding adjustments of (2). The essence of the distribution of the unexpected demands is multi-modality with low probability of occurrence but high resource demand when they do occur. This approach represents a substantial departure from the usual planning model development which produces only an optimal plan based on forecasted developments without provision for adjustment when the forecasted events actually materialize and additional unexpected demands are placed on resources. The adjustment process explored here—which provides the mechanism for optimal implementation of the original plan or control of resource allocation-enables optimal response to information received in “real-time” avoiding the frequently observed over- or under-response to receipt of such information without reference to the impact of the interim decision on future capabilities.

## 8. Use of the Time-Sharing Computer in Business Planning and Budgeting
### Author(s):
- R. C. Raymond
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
The time-sharing computer system now being operated in Phoenix by the Computer Department offers any Company executive willing to spend a few days learning to use the system an entirely new capability to explore and prepare business forecasts. The system does the arithmetic and prints the results in the privacy of the user's office in a few minutes. The planner can explore a range of assumptions and estimates impossible to handle by manual methods and difficult and time-consuming by more traditional computer methods. With the system, the planner can state his basic data and assumptions, observe the results, and then modify any of the assumptions he chooses and get new results within a few minutes. By following this procedure several times it is possible to explore the effects of a variety of environmental assumptions, such as market and price structure for a new product, and to find out what budget of costs for the new product must be realized to yield acceptable business results. This procedure, which requires many days of the time of several individuals by manual methods, can be completed in most cases by one man in less than one day, including the initial programming. An example from a recent new business study is given.

## 10. The Principle of Causation as a Basis of Scientific Method
### Author(s):
- M. Regopoulos
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1966
### Abstract:
The basic condition underlying the entire dimension of scientific research is the firm belief in the causal inevitability of natural phenomena. It is the scientist's job to seek to identify the causes of such phenomena. He is furthermore expected to discover the interrelationships of cause and effect. Accordingly we can assert that scientific research, especially as it has developed after the Renaissance, can be considered to be primarily the practical application of the principle of causation based on observation, analysis (deductive or inductive), experiment, formation of hypothesis, and the formulation of theories and models.
