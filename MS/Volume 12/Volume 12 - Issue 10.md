## 1. The Systems Approach to the National Health Problem
### Author(s):
- William J. Horvath
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
The practice of medicine is presently undergoing considerable modification due to technological innovations. There is a constant flow of new drugs, new treatment methods, new diagnostic techniques and new administrative procedures. In some respects, this plethora of new developments has proved an embarrassment to the medical system. New drugs are marketed and then withdrawn as side effects are manifested; pre-paid medical plans and hospitalization insurance rates are continually modified to keep pace with the new services provided; and the average practitioner has difficulty keeping abreast of new developments while trying to provide maximum service to his patients. In order to enable this system to function effectively in the face of increasing technical advances, the medical profession will have to draw on the resources of systems analysis. This is the only way in which the interrelationships of the different parts of the system can be understood, hopefully to the point where it will be possible to predict the effects on any particular part of the system of changes made in other parts. Since the feedback loops of large social systems such as the medical system are still not well understood, the use of gaming and simulation procedures is proposed as a first step toward such a systems study.

## 2. Simulating with SIMSCRIPT
### Author(s):
- Harry M. Markowitz
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
The SIMSCRIPT programming system is especially designed to facilitate the writing of simulation programs. Digital simulations generally consist of a numerical description of “status,” which is modified at various points in simulated time called “events.” SIMSCRIPT simulations consist primarily of a collection of “event routines” written by the user describing how different kinds of events in a particular simulated world affect current status and cause future events. Status is described in terms of various “entities,” “attributes,” and “sets” as specified by the user.

## 3. A Method of Unifying Multiple Objective Functions
### Author(s):
- Lawrence E. Briskin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
In certain problem areas it is not possible to establish one objective function. There may be several, sometimes conflicting, goals. This paper presents a method of reconciling such conflicting goals by establishing a global objective function. A combinatorial example is given and solved by “modified” dynamic programming.

## 4. Financial Regulation as a Control System Problem: The Case of the Savings & Loan Industry
### Author(s):
- F. E. Balderston
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
Operations and regulation of the savings and loan industry are evaluated in terms of four subsystems: (1) market structure, in which the market environment and the policies of the individual firm are important determinants, but in which, the regulatory authorities have licensing power with respect to the number of firms and branch offices; (2) transactions, which divides into transactions in the capital inflow, or savings, market, and in the capital placement, or lending, market; (3) liquidity, in which the firm's cash flows and liquidity requirements are augmented by the Federal Home Loan Bank system; and (4) safety, in which, the strength of the housing market, the portfolio and reserve position of tie individual institution, and insurance of accounts by the FSLIC are determining factors. The paper discusses the interplay between environment, executive decision and regulatory influence in each of these subsystems and also points to interactions between the subsystems.

## 5. An Operational System for Smoothing Batch-Type Production
### Author(s):
- Richard L. O'Malley
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
- John W. Jeske, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
This paper describes a production smoothing system which combines several known scheduling tools into an operational unit. The input to the system is forecasted customer demand; the outputs are the required production levels, size of labor force, planned overtime and expected inventories of classes and individual end products. Because of varying demand, economic manufacturing quantities are calculated by the method of dynamic programming following Wagner and Whitin. The manufacturing progress function is used to convert units into labor requirements. Finally, the operating schedule is derived by a linear programming formulation which balances payroll costs, the costs of labor fluctuations, and inventory charges. This system has been in operation for several months.

## 6. The Facilities Layout Problem in Perspective
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Vollmann
- Elwood S. Buffa
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
The relative location of facilities in a functional layout has been determined under the criterion of materials handling cost minimization. Recent advances in analytical methods have provided superior solutions within this criterion hut the validity of certain underlying assumptions must be questioned. Materials handling as a criterion is deficient for many facilities layout problems; yet a modified definition of "materials" may yield considerable insight to the improved location of people. Each layout problem is made unique by its particular assumptions, constraints, limitations, and the intrinsic activity of the components; a guide to establishing this uniqueness and to selecting appropriate tool3 for analysis is presented.

## 7. A Statistical Theory for PERT Critical Path Analysis
### Author(s):
- H. O. Hartley
- A. W. Wortham
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
PERT and Critical Path techniques are enjoying exceptionally broad application in industrial and military activities. These techniques and their application have without doubt contributed significantly to better planning, control, and general organization of many programs. Although some currently used PERT computations take account of the variation in the completion times of individual operations, the methods used are approximate and are known to lead to (a) optimistic project completion times and (b) misidentifications of “critical paths.” In this paper the effect of these approximations is assessed and an unbiassed statistical distribution theory for PERT developed. Both analytic theory and numerical analysis are used to achieve this but in certain situations approximate evaluations by Monte Carlo have to be made. Moreover, a new classification of PERT networks is presented along with two methods of analysis which do not have the deficiencies noted above. The classification system delineates clearly between “uncrosaed,” “crossed,” and “mixed networks.”

## 8. Better Estimates of Confidence Intervals for Very Low Error Rate Population
### Author(s):
- Jacob G. Birnberg
- Robert J. A. Pratt
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
In the estimation of error rates for populations, whose error rate is quite small, the usual assumption of normality can lead to erroneous results. The confidence interval that is actually calculated for any given probability will have too low a lower bound, and not a high enough upper bound. Thus, the user may be misled into too optimistic a view of the population being sampled. This article discusses the nature of the problem and provides graphs from which the more accurate interval can be read. The final section of the paper deals with the related problem of confidence intervals when the observed error rate is zero. Tables are provided which facilitates the developing of confidence statements for such samples.

## 9. The Corporate CIA—A Prediction of Things to Come
### Author(s):
- William R. Fair
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
This paper presents the case that there will soon be a confluence of the technical capability, manpower and motivation for corporations to know their competitors much better than they do now. An argument is given that a recognized new corporate activity will develop whose mission will be to study competitors with a view to finding weaknesses which can be capitalized upon. A likely consequence of this development will be the growth of covert activities of a kind which are at least distasteful, are probably immoral and possibly are illegal. If the development of corporate CIA's takes place there will be a new and fascinating arena for analytic skills, but the practitioner will be faced with some very demanding questions of what shall constitute moral behavior.

## 11. Management in the University
### Author(s):
- L. V. Berkner
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1966
### Abstract:
Education is America's biggest single business. It uses more dollars than any other. Education is non-profit, so there is no immediate measure of profit in dollars to assess its performance. Yet the success of the university is at the very root of the economic, the cultural development, the welfare of the community. How should it be organized and managed? How can its performance be assessed so that its job is done most effectively?
