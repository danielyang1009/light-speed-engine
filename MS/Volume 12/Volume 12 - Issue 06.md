## 1. The Ethics of Rational Decision
### Author(s):
- Kenneth E. Boulding
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
In recent years a great deal of attention has been paid by social scientists and others to the problem of the theory of decisions. The decision is a basic concept of social systems, especially in social dynamics. It represents perhaps the most important single class of events, an event being defined as a kind of step-function which separates one position of a social system from the next in point of time. Some events are not the result of human decision at all, such as aging or accidents; some are the results of previous decisions, such as depreciation of a previously created capital structure; but when all these are removed, there remains an important category of events which constitute a deliberate change in state of a social system as a result of human action.

## 2. The Use of Simulation as a Pedagogical Device
### Author(s):
- John C. Porter
- Maurice W. Sasieni
- Eli S. Marks
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
A general simulator of production-inventory systems was developed and used in the classroom to present the student with symptoms and data rather than well-formulated problems. Students were required to analyze and diagnose the situation, formulate the problem, construct appropriate models, organize raw data, and find a solution to the problem. They were permitted to test and evaluate their solutions experimentally. In this way an effort was made to provide students with experience in all phases of operations research, not merely with mathematical exercises in constructing and solving models. The simulator, which was programmed for a computer, presented situations of increasing complexity under direction from the instructor.

## 3. Simulation of a Time-Sharing System
### Author(s):
- Gerald H. Fine
- Paul V. McIsaac
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of simulation techniques at SDC in the analysis of time-sharing system operation. The purpose and goals of this research effort are briefly outlined and some comments on the advantages and disadvantages of direct simulation for this type of work are given. The existing simulator models are described in terms of inputs, general flow, and outputs; and the results of initial investigations with these models are given. Work currently in progress is discussed, and some related problems that may possibly be studied in the future by similar methods are noted.

## 4. The Average Investment Performance Index
### Author(s):
- Kalman J. Cohen
- Bruce P. Fitch
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
In this paper, which is the first step in our efforts to produce an objective standard for use in measuring the investment performance of any portfolio of securities over some period of time, we introduce the average investment performance index (AIPI). The AIPI measures the average return which could have been realized during a particular time period from some specified universe of securities. Our reasons for constructing the AIPI are presented in Section I, where we also formally define the AIPI and discuss the random portfolios which conceptually underlie it. Section II is a mathematical development of the AIPI's properties. We find that the AIPI is equivalent to an unweighted arithmetic average of all actual returns in the given universe of securities, we show how to compute the variance of returns from all possible random portfolios, and we develop a method for linking the values of the AIPI across successive time periods. The use of the AIPI and the variance of random portfolio returns for rating the investment results achieved by portfolio managers is discussed and illustrated in Section III. We feel that the objective evaluations which are the basis of our illustrations should allow the reader to assess the applicability and implications of using the AIPI as a measure of investment performance.

## 5. A Linear Model Approach to Time and Cost Analysis
### Author(s):
- W. H. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
Systems analyses frequently require estimates of the average time that it takes to perform repetitive tasks. These time estimates may be easy to obtain; for example, if one man is performing a single operation, then a simple division of his total working time by the frequency of the task repetition, gives an estimate of the average performance time. However, in many instances, work consolidation requires that individuals be called upon to perform several different operations. For example, crews may be sent into the field to carry out a number of different tasks, for which the relative rate of occurrence may change from day to day.

## 6. Selecting Delivery Dates in the Tanker Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Lawrence E. Briskin
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
When scheduling tankers, it is necessary to determine delivery dates. If multi-port discharges are permitted it is also necessary to determine the proper volumes to be discharged at each port on a given voyage. This paper presents a means of determining a program of delivery dates and volumes for multi-port discharges which may be used in conjunction with an existing routing schema.

## 7. An Application of Heuristic Problem Solving to Accounts Receivable Management
### Author(s):
- Ferdinand K. Levy
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
The paper describes a very apparent application of heuristic problem solving to accounts receivable management, namely in the location of lock-boxes. Lock-boxes are post office boxes selected in a company's distribution area in order to minimize the time necessary for the company to collect and to have available the funds remitted by its customers in payment of their obligations. The paper starts with a statement of and solution to the problem of measuring a given set of locations. Next the difficulties with the formulation are pointed out and a heuristic program to reach a satisfactory solution is described. The program is written in FORTRAN IV and is currently being tested.

## 8. Siting a Distribution Centre, An Analogue Computer Application
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
- D. P. Deziel
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of a general purpose electronic analogue computer for locating a distribution centre, or in general for solving the problem of link-length minimization in networks (for example, when it is required to locate a set of supply points, such that the overall cost of transportation is minimized). Analogue programmes for solving the problem with one or two distribution centres are given and the extension of the method to cover the case of m distribution centres is indicated. Examples for systems with one and two distribution centres are solved and results are compared with those obtained analytically. The method can be extended to cover the case where costs are a non-linear function of distance.

## 9. An Economic Model for the Division of Labor
### Author(s):
- Maurice Kilbridge
- Leon Wester
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
The division of labor in assembly is facilitated by the conveyor line. Workers are stationed along the line on which the frame of the product being assembled moves. The total job is broken into elements of work and assigned in approximately equal shares to the workers on the line. Each operator adds his share of work as the product passes him. The measure of the division of labor is the amount of time the product spends at each operator's work station. This period is commonly called the “cycle time.” The problem of the economic extent of the division of labor is to determine the optimum cycle time, or that which yields the lowest unit direct labor cost of assembly.

## 10. Some Factors Involved in Determining Total Decision Success
### Author(s):
- Samuel G. Trull
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1966
### Abstract:
Currently there is a trend toward attempting to understand the mechanics involved in heuristic decisions, or decisions where the lack of a measure or index of effectiveness, coupled with a surfeit of alternatives and an absence of reliable probabilities associated with decision variables, leads to an open or non-computable decision process.
