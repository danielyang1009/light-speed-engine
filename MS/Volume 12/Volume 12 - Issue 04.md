## 1. On the Theory of Divisional Structures: Some Aspects of Centralization and Decentralization of Control and Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Zenon S. Zannetos
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
The organization structure of the firm has been the subject of diverse research approaches. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for integrating the various views and analyzing the various factors that affect centralization and decentralization. After a historical review of some milestonee in organization research, a definition of decentralization which is based on the overall objectives of the firm is provided. The notions of hierarchical and mutual interaction structures are examined and contrasted with the notion of decentralization. Finally, the determinants of divisionalization are analyzed, and the suggestion is made that a study of the covariance matrix of subunit performance will guide us to the areas that need attention for possible reorganization.

## 2. Intraorganizational Decision Processes Influencing the EDP Staff Budget
### Author(s):
- C. Edward Weber
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
The results of a field study were reported, and implications were suggested for a behavioral theory of the firm. The field study focused on several managers whose decision strategies influenced the budgeted size and composition of the staff of an electronic data processing department (EDP). Two of the managers were directly responsible for proposing the salary budget of EDP. Their decisions were influenced by the decisions of other managers, and the decision processes of both those directly involved and those indirectly involved were analyzed. The study showed the constraints entering into the strategies of managers in a specific situation, and the analysis of these strategies suggested how organizational goals were woven into the managers' decisions. In the situation described, at least, there was less bargaining than our hypotheses had led us to expect. There were conflict and “politics,” but they appeared to be due to differences in judgments about goal expectations of superiors.

## 3. Balancing Accuracy and Simplicity in Determining Reorder Points
### Author(s):
- Joseph A. Hunt
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
Many methods have been developed to determine the proper reorder points and order quantities in an inventory system. These methods are based on a wide range of inventory models—from elementary deterministic models to sophisticated probabilistic models with time-varying parameters. This paper deals with two topics related to these calculations which were encountered during the design of an inventory control system for a firm in the heavy goods industry.

## 4. Competitive Strategies for New Product Marketing Over the Life Cycle
### Author(s):
- Philip Kotler
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of formulating a long-run competitive marketing strategy for a new product introduced into a market with classic growth, seasonal, and merchandising characteristics. The paper is divided into four parts. The first part describes the market model as well as the accounting model used by the firm to compute its profits. The second part discusses nine conceptually different classes of marketing strategies. The third part reports the results of a duopoly confrontation involving various pairs of competitive strategies. The last part suggests additional variations in the market model and in the strategies which would increase the significance of the findings.

## 5. Summary and Evaluation of Recent Work in Measuring the Productivity of Federal Agencies
### Author(s):
- John W. Kendrick
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
The paper contains first a discussion of the nature and meaning of productivity index numbers. Productivity measures are viewed as ratios of output to input, in real terms. They largely reflect changes (or differences) in the technology and organization of production over time (or between similar producing units). The applicability of productivity measurement systems to Federal Government organizations is discussd. Results of the Bureau of Budget report Measuring Productivity of Federal Government Organizations are summarized. While the report covers only 5 Federal, civilian organizations, the author concludes that productivity measurement could usefully be extended to most other civilian agencies, and to some functions of the Department of Defense, particularly in the supply and maintenance areas.

## 6. A Packaging Problem
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
A number of packaging problems involve optimization of costs subject to constraints imposed by the geometry of the alternatives. One such problem arises in those consumer goods warehousing systems which pack a large number of similar products, differing in size, into individual boxes for warehousing and subsequent shipment to the ultimate consumer. Box cardboard costs and warehouse space costs are minimized if boxes exactly fit each product size; on the other hand, box inventory, handling, and purchase costs are minimized if only one box size is used for all product sizes. The problem is to select the optimum number and sizes of boxes which minimize the total system costs. An integer programming formulation of the problem is given, and the results obtained from the application of a heuristic procedure to a specific problem are described.

## 7. Is TIMS Talking to Itself?
### Author(s):
- Donald F. Heany
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1965
### Abstract:
The thesis of this article is that a gap currently exists between “managers” on the one hand and many “scientists” doing research in and on business under the banner of Management Science. It is because of this gap that I believe TIMS is talking to itself. As long as this “TIMS gap” endures, it will be difficult for this organization to attain its stated objectives.
