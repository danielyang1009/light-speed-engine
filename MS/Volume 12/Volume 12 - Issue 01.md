## 1. Optimal Short Term Financing Decision
### Author(s):
- A. A. Robichek
- D. Teichroew
- J. M. Jones
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
The cash requirements of many firms follow a seasonal pattern. These firms may obtain short term cash to cover their seasonal needs from a variety of sources: e.g., lines of credit, delaying of accounts payable, term loans, pledging or factoring receivables, etc. Each of these alternative sources of cash may have different costs as well as special restrictions.

## 2. Dynamic Programming and Systems of Uncertain Duration
### Author(s):
- D. J. White
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the application of dynamic programming to systems whose duration is uncertain, and which duration may or may not be a function of the decisionmaker's policy. It extends some of Bellman's work in that the transformed states at successive stages may not have the properties demanded by Bellman; e.g., the state norm need not diminish at all, and can, in fact, increase. The paper deals primarily with computational considerations since, in general, analytic solutions to functional equations are not forthcoming. Both discrete and continuous formulations are considered, the appropriate one to choose depending on the number of states one wishes to cater for, the continuous formulation having certain advantages which the discrete case does not have when a very large number of states are to be differentiated.

## 3. Optimal Coupon Schedules for Municipal Bonds
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
When an underwriting syndicate submits a bid for a new issue of municipal bonds, one of the important decisions that it must make involves the scheduling of interest coupons to be placed on the bonds. Given the bid specifications stated by the issuing municipality and some prior decisions of the underwriters, it is shown that the determination of the optimal coupon schedule can be expressed as a linear programming problem. Since this LP problem has a special structure, a simple computational algorithm requiring less computation than the simplex method is derived. This paper goes beyond previous contributions to the literature in three important ways. First, simple formulas for obtaining the dual evaluators are developed; the marginal effect of shifts in the yield curve is also presented. Second, it is shown that in the non-integer year case both the conclusions of previous writers and the conventional heuristics of the market may be erroneous, whereas the general solution techniques developed in this paper remain valid. Finally, a direct analogy between the coupon schedule problem and the microeconomic theory of the firm is used in obtaining the special computational algorithm for this LP problem.

## 4. Constrained Generalized Medians and Hypermedians as Deterministic Equivalents for Two-Stage Linear Programs under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- G. L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
In linear programming under uncertainty the two-stage problem is handled by assuming that one chooses a first set of constrained decision variables; this is followed by observations of certain random variables after which another set of decisions must be made to adjust for any constraint violations. The objective is to optimize an expected value functional defined relative to the indicated choices.

## 5. On Representations of Semi-Infinite Programs which Have No Duality Gaps
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- K. Kortanek
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
Duality gaps which may occur in semi-infinite programs are shown to be interpretable as a phenomenon of an improper representation of the constraint set, uTPi ≧ ci, i ε I. Thus, any semi-infinite system of linear inequalities has a canonically closed equivalent (with interior points) which has no duality gap. With respect to the original system of inequalities, duality gaps may be closed by adjoining additional linear inequalities to the original system. Also, for consistent, but not necessarily canonically closed programs, a partial regularization of original data removes duality gaps that may occur. In contrast, a new “weakly consistent” duality theorem without duality gap may have a value determined by an inequality which is strictly redundant with respect to the constraint set defined by the total inequality system.

## 6. An Infinite Linear Program with a Duality Gap
### Author(s):
- R. J. Duffin
- L. A. Karlovitz
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
The first part of this paper is concerned with the semi-infinite linear programs studied by Charnes, Cooper and Kortanek. A form of the Farkas lemma stated by Haar appears to apply to such programs and leads to a duality theorem. In this paper an example of a semi-infinite program is given which is consistent and which has a finite minimum. However the dual program is found to be inconsistent. With a variation of the example a situation is exhibited in which both the program and its dual are consistent and have finite extrema. In this case, however, the minimum of the former is not equal to the maximum of the latter. The existence of such a “duality gap” indicates that Haar's statement needs qualification. In the second part of the paper a correct form of Haar's theorem is stated and proved. The proof invokes the infinite programming theory of Duffin and Kretschmer. The last part of the paper develops a new duality theory for infinite programs which, as a special case, insures a weak form of duality for programs typified by the examples. This new duality theory is somewhat simpler than previous theories of infinite programming.

## 7. The Simplex Method: Two Basic Variables Replacement
### Author(s):
- S. R. Paranjape
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
The paper presents a method for solving the linear programming problems, which is itself a step towards the generalization of the classical Simlex Method. It replaces two basic variables by two non-basic variables at each iteration. Naturally this will reduce the total number of steps to reach the final solution. The paper also includes the solution of one example to illustrate the applicability of the method.

## 8. A Note on the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique for Non-Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Stong
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
This note considers a method due to Carroll for replacing a constrained minimization problem by a sequence of unconstrained problems. Mathematical validity or convergence of this technique is shown under fairly general conditions. No computability is asserted beyond that obtained by other authors under more restrictive assumptions.

## 9. Communications to the Editor—A Note on “Decomposition of Project Networks”
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Blanning
- Ambar G. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1965
### Abstract:
In their paper Management Science, Vol. 11, No. 3, January 1965, pp. 444–459), S. C. Parikh and W. S. Jewell discuss the decomposition of cost-time project networks into subnetworks to aid in finding a cost function for the entire project. They suggest that each subproject be replaced by a set of fictitious activities (in series or in parallel) and that a subsequent analysis be performed using network flow theory. However, when the network configuration is such that series and parallel subprojects can be successively joined to give one project, a simpler method is available, which we wish to present here.
