## 1. Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Ronald A. Howard
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
Dynamic programming is a mathematical technique for solving certain types of sequential decision problems. We characterize a sequential decision problem as a problem in which a sequence of decisions must be made with each decision affecting future decisions. We need to consider such problems because we rarely encounter an operational situation where the implications of any decision do not extend far into the future. For example, the best way to invest funds this year depends upon how the proceeds from this year's investments can be employed next year. The maintenance policy we should use for our machinery this year depends upon what we intend to do with this machinery in the future. The examples are as numerous as the fields of man's endeavor.

## 2. Markovian Decision Models for Reject Allowance Problems
### Author(s):
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
Most manufacturing processes produce some defective items. To compensate for this, the total quantity produced in attempting to satisfy an order is larger than the order size. The excess is called a reject allowance. In this paper it is shown how the Markovian decision framework can be used to determine the amount to produce when production is, or can be, divided so that the products can be inspected before the production run is ended.

## 3. On Nonterminating Stochastic Games
### Author(s):
- A. J. Hoffman
- R. M. Karp
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
A stochastic game is played in a sequence of steps; at each step the play is said to be in some state i, chosen from a finite collection of states. If the play is in state i, the first player chooses move k and the second player chooses move l, then the first player receives a reward akli, and, with probability pklij, the next state is j.

## 4. Diagonalization of Quadratic Forms by Gauss Elimination
### Author(s):
- Charles S. Beightler
- Douglass J. Wilde
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
The La Grange linear similarity transformation (completing the square) can be used to remove all cross-product terms from a quadratic form. It is shown that the La Grange transformation may be found conveniently by adapting the well-known Gauss elimination procedure for solving linear equations. A simple algorithm for finding the inverse transformation is given. This diagonalization scheme takes much less effort than finding the characteristic roots and vectors. It produces important simplifications in quadratic programming, statistics, and optimization problems.

## 5. An Extension of a Theorem on Supports of a Convex Function
### Author(s):
- S. M. Sinha
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
In Eisenberg, E. 1962. Supports of a convex function. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.68 192–195, Eisenberg has given a characterization of the set of all supports of a convex function defined on a polyhedral convex cone. This extends the famous Farkas' Lemma and is very useful in programming problems. In this paper we will show that the result is true even for a larger class of convex functions.

## 6. A Duality Theorem for Nonlinear Programming
### Author(s):
- S. M. Sinha
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
One reasonable formulation of stochastic linear programming problem leads to a deterministic nonlinear programming problem where the non-linearity occurs in the objective function as the sum of square roots of positive semi-definite quadratic forms. It may, however, be difficult to solve this problem directly because of the nondifferentiability of the terms in the objective function. The present paper establishes a dual to the nonlinear programming problem of which a solution may be easily obtained. A solution of the dual then helps to obtain a solution of the original problem.

## 7. The (S − 1, S) Inventory Policy Under Compound Poisson Demand
### Author(s):
- G. J. Feeney
- C. C. Sherbrooke
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
This paper derives the simple analytic solution to the special but important inventory problem in which the optimal policy is to reorder whenever units are demanded. The demand distribution can be any compound Poisson; the resupply distribution is arbitrary. Both the backorder case and the lost sales case are solved by generalizing a queueing theorem due to Palm.

## 8. On Jockeying in Queues
### Author(s):
- Ernest Koenigsberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
There are numerous queueing situations in which those awaiting service may be allowed to make choices which affect the time spent in the service system. In such cases, it should be possible to formulate a “strategy” for customers to follow in order to optimize a given parameter. A whole class of queue problems which involve “jockeying” can be regarded in this way, but has so far received little attention. Jockeying can be described as the movement of of a waiting customer from one queue to another (of shorter length or which appears to be moving faster, etc.) in anticipation of a shorter delay. We have so far considered steady state solutions for just a few of the various possible jockeying disciplines in two-server systems with heterogeneous “exponential” servers and Poisson inputs. As a basis for comparison, we first treat the heterogeneous server problems where arriving customers join the shorter of two independent waiting lines and are not permitted to jockey. The same problem is then considered allowing instantaneous jockeying from the longer to the shorter line when the difference in line lengths exceeds one. The results, in terms of expected line lengths and delays, are identical to those obtained by Gumbel (Gumbel, H. 1960. Waiting lines with heterogeneous servers. Oper. Res.8 504.) for heterogeneous servers fed from a single queue. When the same problem, with customer preferences for a specific line, is considered the results are identical to those of Krishnamoorthi (Krishnamoorthi, B. 1963. On a poisson queue with two heterogeneous servers. Oper. Res.11 321). It is important to note that in these two problems the slower server has a larger throughput than might be expected from the classical theory. In other words, the slower server acts as a trapping state. In the last problems treated here, customers join a preferred line and may jockey at a rate proportional to the line lengths or proportional to the difference in line lengths.

## 9. Scheduling Independent Tasks on Parallel Processors
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Rothkopf
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of scheduling m independent, immediately available tasks on n parallel processors. Each task has a waiting cost rate, that is a function of time, and a service time. There are no feasibility restrictions on the order in which the tasks are to be processed. An optimal scheduling rule is presented for the single processor scheduling of tasks with continuously discounted linear waiting costs. A dynamic programming algorithm has been developed for a wide class of parallel-processor problems. Linear waiting costs (with or without discounting), arbitrary processor use costs, and certain other costs are considered. In certain cases, the service time of a task may be a function of the processor that performs it.

## 10. Sales Forecasting Errors and Inventory Fluctutions: Random Errors and Random Sales
### Author(s):
- Howard E. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of errors in the sales forecast on inventory changes and production rates. This is done by computing the ratio of the standard deviation of inventory change or production rate to the standard deviation of sales rate. By use of this ratio the effects of the average forecast error, the variance of the forecast error, and the serial correlation of sales can be studied. Both analytical method and simulation procedures are used.

## 11. Search-Theoretic Models of Organization Control by Budgeted Multiple Goals
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- A. C. Stedry
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1966
### Abstract:
Models of situations in which individuals are faced with multiple activities among which they must allocate their effort are postulated. Optimal allocations are found for four assumed motivational structures—profit maximization and three involving performance goals in each of the activities. Heuristic approximations to the optimal allocations are developed. Also, the relationships between the various motivation structures are explored.
