## 1. The Sequential Selection of Approaches to a Task
### Author(s):
- T. A. Marschak

### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
A task (e.g., development of a satisfactory item by a Research and Development team) is to be performed. A population of distinct approaches to the task is available. The decision maker's preferences over completed approaches are representable by a utility indicator. The utility of an approach is unknown until it is completed, but as the approach is pursued successive estimates of its utility become available at each of a finite sequence of decision points. The vector composed of an approach's estimates and its true utility is a random variable with known distribution. Pursuing an approach from one decision point to the next costs a fixed amount. Starting from an initial random drawing from the population of approaches, the set of approaches to be further pursued is narrowed down at each decision point. The paper seeks, under alternative conditions on the distribution, computationally and economically interesting properties of an optimal policy, prescribing both the sequential narrowing down and the size of the initial drawing.

## 2. Theory and Application of an Estimation Model for Time Series with Nonstationary Means
### Author(s):
- Melvin Hinich
- John U. Farley
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
Time series models of a complex nature, such as consumer brand switching analyses, have required assumptions of parameter stability because statistical models were not available to deal with parameter change. A model is developed here to estimate a stepwise change in the mean process of a Gaussian time series. Estimators which are small-sample efficient in a special sense are presented, along with examples and suggested applications of the method to brand switching problems.

## 3. The Effects of Parameter Misspecification and Non-Stationarity on the Applicability of Adaptive Forecasts
### Author(s):
- John Bossons
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
A “blowup factor” is defined for the measurement of the effect on forecast error variance of two types of misspecification which may be implicit in the choice of a particular adaptive forecasting scheme: (1) misspecification of the number of non-zero parameters of the stationary linear stochastic process generating the observed time series, and (2) misspecification arising from postulating stationarity when in fact the generating process is non-stationary in mean.

## 4. Warehouse Location Under Continuous Economies of Scale
### Author(s):
- E. Feldman
- F. A. Lehrer
- T. L. Ray
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
Warehouse Location is a nonconvex programming problem involving the geographic placing and sizing of intermediate facilities in distribution studies. The nonconvexities are caused by economies of scale associated with the cost of building and operating the facilities. A heuristic program has been developed for solving warehouse location problems when these economies are representable by continuous concave functions. The paper discusses the heuristics used and computational experience with the program on “practical” problems. On the basis of two numerical examples for which an optimal solution was obtained through a special purpose experimental mixed integer programming code, it is conjectured (1) that near optimal solutions can be achieved using the heuristic program and (2) that optimal sizing and locating of facilities are very sensitive to the shapes of the warehousing cost functions.

## 5. The Analysis of a Simple Class of Multistage Inspection Plans
### Author(s):
- Leon S. White
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
A simple class of multistage inspection plans is considered for an ordered production process consisting of N − 1 manufacturing stages and a final inspection stage. The plans are applied to batches of items of size S. At each stage any number of items from 0 to S may be inspected. Defectives found are replaced with non-defectives. Costs of inspection, replacement, and the cost of undetected defectives are included. It is shown that under certain conditions an optimal inspection plan has the property that at every stage either the whole batch is inspected or no inspection is performed. In such cases a very simple dynamic program can be solved to find the optimal plan.

## 6. Minimum Cost Replacement Under Markovian Deterioration
### Author(s):
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
Conditions are derived under which optimal replacement rules for systems subject to Markovian deterioration and failure are given by control limit replacement rules. An efficient method of deriving such rules is given which is based on the simplex algorithm.

## 7. Scheduling with Random Service Times
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Rothkopf
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem scheduling of m immediately available tasks with random variable service times. It is shown that certain such problems can be reduced to equivalent deterministic problems. The existence of optimal schedules not involving the removal from service of incompletely processed tasks for some problems is proved and for other problems is disproved.

## 8. A Quadratic Programming Approach to the Estimation of Transition Probabilities
### Author(s):
- H. Theil
- Guido Rey
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
In a recent article L. G. Telser [Telser, L. G. 1963. Least-squares estimates of transition probabilities. Measurement in Economics: Studies in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics in Memory of Yehuda Grunfeld, Chapter 11, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California.] considered the problem of estimating transition probabilities in Markov processes from a set of observations on one-dimensional frequency distributions. The problem is to estimate the matrix of transition probabilities under the assumption that observations are confined to the shares of the n possibilities in successive periods. The present paper is an extension of the work of Goodman [Goodman, L. A. 1953. A further note on Miller's “finite Markov processes in psychology.” Psychometrika18 245–248.] and Telser.

## 9. Optimal Search for a Maximum with Sequences of Simultaneous Function Evaluations
### Author(s):
- Mordecai Avriel
- Douglass J. Wilde
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
A minimax search plan is developed for locating the maximum of a unimodal function of one variable with a sequence of blocks of simultaneous function evaluations. The proposed “block search strategy” is described for any number of simultaneous function evaluations (experiments) and for any number of blocks in the sequence. For one experiment per block it reduces to the Fibonacci strategy; in the case of only one block of experiments, to the simultaneous search plan. The “block search strategy” is optimal in the sense that for a required final interval of uncertainty, known to contain the point where the function attains its maximum, and for any given number of simultaneous experiments and blocks, it has the largest possible starting interval. A discrete variable version of the proposed search strategy is also described.

## 10. Matrix Rounding Problems
### Author(s):
- Michael Bacharach
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
The problem considered in this paper is that of consistently rounding off the elements of a matrix and its row and column sums. It is shown that a class of rounding problems of this kind is equivalent to a class of problems of determining flows through networks having arbitrary lower as well as upper bounds on edge flows. An existence theorem first proved by Hoffman for flows in such networks is used to show that an important subclass of the matrix rounding problems considered is always soluble. An algorithm for the entire class is illustrated by a numerical example.

## 11. Communication to the Editor—Critical Comments on “Measuring Risk on Consumer Instalment Credit” by Paul F. Smith
### Author(s):
- Kalman J. Cohen
- Frederick S. Hammer
### Published:
- 1 May 1966
### Abstract:
In his article [Smith, P. F. 1964. Measuring risk on consumer instalment credit. Management Sci.11(2, November) 327–340], Smith develops a simple statistical method for measuring risk on individual accounts which he feels can be used for controlling the quality of portfolios of consumer instalment loans and for estimating loss rates. His tests seem to indicate that this approach is promising. There are, however, grave deficiencies in both the testing procedure and the conceptual foundations of his approach. To see this clearly, the more important problems that arise will be discussed in the same order as they occur in the article.
