## 1. Capital Budgeting of Interrelated Projects: Survey and Synthesis
### Author(s):
- H. Martin Weingartner
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
As capital budgeting decision procedures become more complex, they must allow for more aspects of the real world. The present article surveys the techniques available to handle the important and generally neglected problem of project interrelationships such as mutual exclusion and interdependencies. The techniques utilized are linear and integer programming, dynamic programing, and the discrete optimizing procedure of Reiter. Project interrelationships arising from randomness of outcomes and nonlinear utility functions are also subjected to scrutiny by application of these procedures, and additional interrelationships, arising in the context of research and development budgets, are analyzed. A dynamic programming code for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem is also presented.

## 2. A Min-Max Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Norman Agin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
An inventory model is considered where every N periods an order is placed for an amount which brings the sum of stock-on-hand plus on-order up to some level S. The model treats a single item for which there is random demand. Demands that arrive when there is no positive inventory on hand are back-ordered. Leadtime is treated as random and the receipts of orders are allowed to cross in time.

## 3. A Linear Approach to the Dynamic Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Adolf Diegel
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
The decision aspects of inventory management revolve around striking some balance between the costs of change and the costs of failing to change. However, in any but the simplest cases of economic order quantities it is difficult to specify precisely how one cost interacts with the other: by how much exactly do additional set-ups reduce the total cost of inventories or wasted production, or the total penalties for delayed deliveries or lost sales—supposing that units are taken out of inventory by some demand function and added to inventories by some production function?

## 4. Scheduling Short-Run Changes in Production to Minimize Long-Run Expected Costs
### Author(s):
- Howard Kunreuther
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the problem of scheduling production from one period to the next to minimize long-run expected costs where the only relevant considerations are the expense of revising production and the charges related to inventory. We first consider the case of constant sales known over time in order to compare exact and approximate solutions. The approach to these solutions is based on minimizing the costs of deviating from long-run equilibrium values of production and inventory. The same approach is then used to handle the more realistic possibility of uncertain future demands. Solutions are obtained for both linear and quadratic inventory and production cost functions. Because future demand is assumed to be specified by some probability distribution, inventory costs must be approximated in order to obtain a closed-form solution; however, the result should differ insignificantly from an exact optimal solution.

## 5. The Dual Method for the Generalized Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Egon Balas
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
In this paper the dual method and the poly-ω technique are specialized for the generalized transportation problem. A simple procedure is obtained for solving the parametric version of this problem, i.e. for passing from a solution optimal for given values of the parameters, to solutions optimal for other values of the parameters. This procedure is then extended to the case when not only the parameters change, but additional constraints appear. Finally, the procedure may be used as a general method for solving the usual (nonparametric) generalized transportation problem, and for this case a way is described for finding an initial (dual-feasible) solution.

## 6. An Extension of the Gomory Mixed-Integer Algorithm to Mixed-Discrete Variables
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Dalton
- Robert W. Llewellyn
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
The methods of R. E. Gomory for the iterative solution of the mixed-integer linear programming problem are extended directly to the case where some or all of the variables are nonuniformly discrete, i.e., they are restricted to assume values from certain specified sets of unequally-spaced constants. The algorithm presented is shown to converge in a finite number of steps for a discrete-valued objective function.

## 7. An Algorithm for the Solution of Mixed Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Norman J. Driebeek
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
An algorithm is presented for the solution of mixed integer programming problems. The method was developed to solve primarily those programming problems which contain a large number of continuous variables in addition to a few variables that are restricted to discrete values. The algorithm solves a continuous, non-integer constrained problem first. Subsequently, a search for the optimum integer solution is made on the basis of those changes in the value of the objective function that are produced by activating integer constraints.

## 8. Techniques for Removing Nonbinding Constraints and Extraneous Variables from Linear Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Gerald L. Thompson
- Fred M. Tonge
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
In formulating linear programming problems, analysts tend to include constraints that are not binding at the optimal solution for fear of excluding necessary constraints. The inclusion of such constraints does not alter the optimum solutions, but may require many additional iterations to be taken, as well as increase the computational difficulties encountered.

## 9. On Some Properties of Programming Problems in Parametric form Pertaining to Fractional Programming
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
This paper presents results which apply to convex programming problem in parametric form. The results secured are also related to the problem of fractional programming in a way which indicates computational possibilities for the latter class of problems. The results are extended to general non-linear programming problems with special reference to continuous criterion functions. As a particular case, the linear fractional programming problem is considered and, in conclusion, the results secured here are pointed up by reference to existing algorithms for the latter class of problems.

## 10. Communications to the Editor—The Use of Regression Equations to Predict Manpower Requirements: Critical Comments
### Author(s):
- John Leslie Livingstone
- David Bruce Montgomery
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
In a recent article in Management Science, [Drui, A. B. 1963. The use of regression equations to predict manpower requirements. Management Sci. 8(4, July) 669–677.] an application of multiple regression analysis to the prediction of departmental manpower requirements was described. Little information was given regarding the data of the study, and little attention was paid to the assumptions of the regression model. This calls into question the conclusions of the study, since the regression methodology contains a potentially serious bias. In view of the economic importance of the problem, the purpose of the present comment is to suggest improvements in the analysis.

## 11. A Comment on Baumol (E, L) Efficient Portfolios
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
Baumol [Baumol, W. J. 1963. An expected gain-confidence limit criterion for portfolio selection. Management Sci. (October) 174–182.] has provided a framework which may be useful in utilizing any additional information about the investor's preferences between the expected yield from a portfolio and its variability. However, this usefulness applies only in the case where the investor rejects portfolios containing riskless assets.

## 12. Optimal Programming of Lot Sizes, Inventories and Labor Allocations—A Comment
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Grigoriadis
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1966
### Abstract:
In a recent article in this journal, B. P. Dzielinski and R. E. Gomory [Dzielinski, B. P., R. E. Gomory. 1965. Optimal programming of lot sizes, inventory and labor allocations. Management Sci.11(9, July) 874–890.] discussed the use of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle to accomplish a reduction in the large number of constraints appearing in the linear programming tableau. A comment is included on the maximum number of fractional solutions, i.e. the solutions specifying that items are to be manufactured according to two or more production plan sequences. The interpretation of such solutions in terms of the physical situation requires special attention and treatment on the part of the analyst.
