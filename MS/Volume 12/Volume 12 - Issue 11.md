## 1. The Status of Mathematical Inventory Theory
### Author(s):
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
This paper surveys the current status of mathematical inventory theory. The review is limited to studies which seek optimal policies for dynamic inventory models. Models with certain and uncertain demands are discussed. Particular attention is focused on multi-item and/or multi-echelon inventory systems.

## 2. A Dynamic Programming Approach to a Lot Size Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Earl E. Bomberger
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
The problem considered is that of scheduling the production of several different items over the same facility on a repetitive basis. The facility is such that only one item can be produced at a time; there is a setup cost and a setup time associated with producing each item; the demand rate for each item is known and constant over an infinite planning horizon, and all demand must be met.

## 3. A Bayesian Analysis of the Style Goods Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- George R. Murray, Jr.
- Edward A. Silver
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
A style goods item has a finite selling period during which the sales rate varies in a seasonal and, to some extent, predictable fashion. There are only a limited number of opportunities to purchase or manufacture the style goods item, and the cost, in general, will depend on the time at which the item is obtained. The unit revenue achieved from sales of the item also varies during the selling season, and, in particular, reaches an appreciably lower terminal salvage value.

## 4. Programming with a Quadratic Constraint
### Author(s):
- C. van de Panne
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
A method is given for maximizing a linear function subject to a quadratic and a number of linear constraints. The method differs from general convex programming methods by terminating in a finite number of iterations and is actually an application of the Simplex and dual methods for quadratic programming to parametric quadratic programming problems. The method is shown to be useful for the solution of some chance-constrained programming problems. Detailed rules and a simple example of an application are given.

## 5. Extensions of SUMT for Nonlinear Programming: Equality Constraints and Extrapolation
### Author(s):
- Anthony V. Fiacco
- Garth P. McCormick
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
This paper extends the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique for nonlinear programming to include problems where the constraints are a mixture of inequalities and equalities. Theorems indicating the dual nature of the method and the solution of a subproblem are given. Finally, the theoretical basis for a k-point extrapolation procedure is established.

## 6. Discrete Optimizing Solution Procedures for Linear and Nonlinear Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Stanley Reiter
- Donald B. Rice
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
We present a method for approximating the solution of mixed integer non-concave programming problems in bounded variables. We present computational results for 39 test problems which suggest that the procedure offers a practical useful way of approximating solutions of programming problems of the type tested. We have also discovered an apparent regularity in the distribution of local optima generated by the method; the method seems to generate Beta distributions in all problems for which results are available. This suggests interesting opportunities for further exploration.

## 7. Financial Measurement of Capital Investments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
Suppose each alternative in a capital investment decision can be represented as a cash flow without uncertainty, i.e., as a sequence of m + 1 real numbers. Then the problem of which financial criterion (e.g., present value, internal rate of return, return per unit expenditure, etc.) to use for the capital investment decision is the problem of defining a preference ordering (which usually means a utility function) on the vector space of dimension m + 1. A Set of axioms is proposed for the preference ordering. The axioms specify the directions of preference in case one cash flow dominates another in magnitude (at least as great in every period, greater in some period) or in time (same total revenue, but received sooner). Also, an axiom of marginal consistency is specified, i.e., one cash flow is preferred to another if and only if the difference (considered as a separate investment) is preferred to the do-nothing investment. In addition, there is an axiom of continuity. Our result is that the only consistent (i.e., consistent with the axioms) method for ranking investments according to their cash flows is to rank them according to the formula for “present value”, with positive (undetermined) rates of interest, possibly different for different time periods. Finally, an axiom specifying “temporal consistency” leads to the use of a single rate of interest. The viewpoint is that an overall corporate capital budgeting problem has two aspects: (1) the determination of a criterion, and (2) the determination of that capital program which maximizes the criterion, subject to the relevant constraints, e.g., on available projects, capital markets, etc. This paper is concerned with the first aspect only.

## 8. Demon: Decision Mapping Via Optimum Go-No Networks—A Model for Marketing New Products
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- J. K. De Voe
- D. B. Learner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
In this paper a dynamic, adaptive model, called DEMON,4 is interpreted in terms of a network. The latter is here employed to reduce the problem of selecting optimal decision procedures so that these can be interpreted in terms of a conditional sequential designation of links from such a network. More is involved, however, than is immediately apparent from the network possibilities only. Thus, in the DEMON applications to new product marketing—as discussed in the present paper—it is necessary to comprehend additional chance and deterministic constraints such as (1) payback, or breakeven, conditions that may be specified for fulfillment over a given time horizon, (2) minimum expected level of profits required and (3) study budget limits which should not be exceeded. By means of preemptions or over-rides, which also form a part of DEMON, however, it is possible to relate these additional constraints to the network as we also show by means of a development via ideas associated with the right inverse of an incidence matrix.

## 9. The Priority Problem and Computer Time Sharing
### Author(s):
- Martin Greenberger
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1966
### Abstract:
Priority decisions arise whenever limited facilities must be apportioned among competitive demands for service. Broadly viewed, even the familiar first-come-first-served discipline is a priority rule. It favors the longest-waiting user, and guards against excessive delays. Other priority rules, such as shortest-job-next, are keyed instead to considerations of operating efficiency. Urgency of request is still another common consideration. Since these considerations often conflict, the priority rule serves as mediator. Use of a common coat measure can help effect this mediation, as results from recent job-shop simulations illustrate.
