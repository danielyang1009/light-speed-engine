## 2. Effects of E-Waste Regulation on New Product Introduction

### Abstract:
This paper investigates the impact of e-waste regulation on new product introduction in a stylized model of the electronics industry. Manufacturers choose the development time and expenditure for each new version of a durable product, which together determine its quality. Consumers purchase the new product and dispose of the last-generation product, which becomes e-waste. The price of a new product strictly increases with its quality and consumers' rational expectation about the time until the next new product will be introduced. Fee-upon-sale types of e-waste regulation cause manufacturers to increase their equilibrium development time and expenditure, and thus the incremental quality for each new product. As new products are introduced (and disposed of) less frequently, the quantity of e-waste decreases and, even excluding the environmental benefits, social welfare may increase. Consumers pay a higher price for each new product because they anticipate using it for longer, which increases manufacturers' profits. Unfortunately, existing fee-upon-sale types of e-waste regulation fail to motivate manufacturers to design for recyclability. In contrast, fee-upon-disposal types of e-waste regulation such as individual extended producer responsibility motivate design for recyclability but, in competitive product categories, fail to reduce the frequency of new product introduction.

## 3. Searching for Google's Value: Using Prediction Markets to Forecast Market Capitalization Prior to an Initial Public Offering
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We conducted prediction markets designed to forecast post-initial public offering (IPO) valuations before a particularly unique IPO: Google. The prediction markets forecast Google's post-IPO market capitalization relatively accurately. While Google's auction-based IPO price was 15.3% below the first-day closing market capitalization, the final prediction market forecast was only 4.0% above it. The forecast also accorded with the level of over-subscription in the IPO auction. Evidence available to both outsiders (from the prediction market forecasts) and insiders (through the orders in Google's auction) predicted similar degrees of underpricing. We argue that, with repetition, such markets could provide useful information for understanding the IPO process.

## 4. Inventories with Multiple Supply Sources and Networks of Queues with Overflow Bypasses
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
Consider an inventory system with multiple supply sources and Poisson demand. The replenishment lead times from each source are stochastic, representing congestion and disruption. We develop performance evaluation and optimization tools for a family of reasonable order policies. These policies take into account real-time supply information, which can be obtained through tracking technologies such as global positioning systems and radio frequency identification. Performance evaluation of such state-dependent policies is generally hard. The main thrust of this paper is to show that, under these policies, the supply system becomes a network of queues with a special routing mechanism called an overflow bypass. The solution has a simple product form. Thus, we obtain closed-form performance measures. These results reinterpret and extend the existing analysis of a system with two sources having deterministic lead times. We further extend the analysis to batch ordering policies, non-Poisson demand processes, and multiple demand classes.

### Published:
- 24 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
Although spillovers are a crucial factor in determining the optimal environment for innovation, there is no consensus regarding their impact on firm behavior. One reason for this may be that models differ in their assumptions for the functional form of the spillover pool. In industrial organization and economic geography, for example, the predominant convention is that all innovation within an industry/region contributes to a spillover pool that has a common value for all firms. An alternative convention prevalent in endogenous growth and evolutionary economics is that spillovers have directionalitythe size of the relevant pool differs across firms.

## 6. Causal Ambiguity, Complexity, and Capability-Based Advantage
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Ryall
### Published:
- 18 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
This paper presents the first formal examination of role of causal ambiguity as a barrier to imitation. Here, the aspiring imitator faces a knowledge (i.e., capabilities-based) barrier to imitation that is both causal and ambiguous in a precise sense of both words. Imitation conforms to a well-explicated process of learning by observing. I provide a precise distinction between the intrinsic causal ambiguity associated with a particular strategy and the subjective ambiguity perceived by a challenger. I find that intrinsic ambiguity is a necessary but insufficient condition for a sustained capability-based advantage. I also demonstrate that combinatorial complexity, a phenomenon that has attracted the recent attention of strategy theorists, and causal ambiguity are distinct barriers to imitation. The former acts as a barrier to explorative/active learning and the latter as one to absorptive/passive learning. One implication of this is that learning by doing and learning by observing are complementary strategic activities, not substitutesin most cases, we should expect firm strategies to seek performance enhancement using efforts of both types.

### Published:
- 24 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
We study a single-product single-location inventory system under periodic review, where excess demand is lost and the replenishment lead time is positive. The performance measure of interest is the long-run average holding cost and lost sales penalty cost. For a large class of demand distributions, we show that when the lost sales penalty becomes large compared to the holding cost, the relative difference between the cost of the optimal policy and the best order-up-to policy converges to zero. For any given cost parameters, we establish a bound on this relative difference. Numerical experiments show that the best order-up-to policy performs well, yielding an average cost that is within 1.5% of the optimal cost when the ratio between the lost sales penalty and the holding cost is 100. We also propose a heuristic order-up-to level using two newsvendor expressions; in our experiments, the cost of this order-up-to policy is 2.52% higher, on an average, than the best order-up-to policy.

## 8. Economic Analysis of Simulation Selection Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
Ranking and selection procedures are standard methods for selecting the best of a finite number of simulated design alternatives based on a desired level of statistical evidence for correct selection. But the link between statistical significance and financial significance is indirect, and there has been little or no research into it. This paper presents a new approach to the simulation selection problem, one that maximizes the expected net present value of decisions made when using stochastic simulation. We provide a framework for answering these managerial questions: When does a proposed system design, whose performance is unknown, merit the time and money needed to develop a simulation to infer its performance? For how long should the simulation analysis continue before a design is approved or rejected? We frame the simulation selection problem as a stoppable version of a Bayesian bandit problem that treats the ability to simulate as a real option prior to project implementation. For a single proposed system, we solve a free boundary problem for a heat equation that approximates the solution to a dynamic program that finds optimal simulation project stopping times and that answers the managerial questions. For multiple proposed systems, we extend previous Bayesian selection procedures to account for discounting and simulation-tool development costs.

## 9. Strategic Information Management Under Leakage in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Dec 2008
### Abstract:
The importance of material flow management for a profit-maximizing firm has been well articulated in the supply chain literature. We demonstrate in our analytical model that a firm must also actively manage information flows within the supply chain, which translates to controlling what it knows, as well as what its competitors and suppliers know. In our model of horizontal competition between an informed and an uninformed firm with a common upstream supplier, material and information flows intersect through leakage of demand (order) information to unintended recipients. As a result, the informed firm's drive to control information flows within the supply chain can trigger operational losses through material flow distortion. These losses can be so severe that the firm may prefer not to acquire information even when it is costless to do so. Our results underscore the importance of strategic information managementactively managing the supply chain's information flows, and making trade-offs with material flows where appropriate, to maximize profits.

## 10. Persistency Model and Its Applications in Choice Modeling

### Published:
- 17 Dec 2008
### Abstract:
Given a discrete maximization problem with a linear objective function where the coefficients are chosen randomly from a distribution, we would like to evaluate the expected optimal value and the marginal distribution of the optimal solution. We call this the persistency problem for a discrete optimization problem under uncertain objective, and the marginal probability mass function of the optimal solution is named the persistence value. In general, this is a difficult problem to solve, even if the distribution of the objective coefficient is well specified. In this paper, we solve a subclass of this problem when the distribution is assumed to belong to the class of distributions defined by given marginal distributions, or given marginal moment conditions. Under this model, we show that the persistency problem maximizing the expected objective value over the set of distributions can be solved via a concave maximization model. The persistency model solved using this formulation can be used to obtain important qualitative insights to the behavior of stochastic discrete optimization problems. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to obtain insights to problems in discrete choice modeling. Using a set of survey data from a transport choice modeling study, we calibrate the random utility model with choice probabilities obtained from the persistency model. Numerical results suggest that our persistency model is capable of obtaining estimates that perform as well, if not better, than classical methods, such as logit and cross-nested logit models. We can also use the persistency model to obtain choice probability estimates for more complex choice problems. We illustrate this on a stochastic knapsack problem, which is essentially a discrete choice problem under budget constraint.

## 11. An Investigation of Time Inconsistency
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Dec 2008
### Abstract:
Preference between two future outcomes may change over timea phenomenon labeled as time inconsistency. The term time inconsistency is usually used to refer to cases in which a larger-later outcome is preferred over a smaller-sooner one when both are delayed by some time, but then with the passage of time a preference switches to the smaller-sooner outcome. The current paper presents four empirical studies showing that time inconsistency in the other direction is also possible: A person may prefer the smaller-sooner outcome when both options are in the future, but decide to wait for the larger-later one when the smaller option becomes immediately available. We find that such reverse time inconsistency is more likely to be observed when the delays to and between the two outcomes are short (up to a week). We propose that reverse time inconsistency may be associated with a reversed-S shape discount function, and provide evidence that such a discount function captures part of the variation in intertemporal preferences.

## 12. Dirichlet Bridge Sampling for the Variance Gamma Process: Pricing Path-Dependent Options
### Author(s):
- Vladimir K. Kaishev
- Dimitrina S. Dimitrova
### Published:
- 17 Dec 2008
### Abstract:
The authors develop a new Monte Carlo-based method for pricing path-dependent options under the variance gamma (VG) model. The gamma bridge sampling method proposed by Avramidis et al. (Avramidis, A. N., P. L'Ecuyer, P. A. Tremblay. 2003. Efficient simulation of gamma and variance-gamma processes. Proc. 2003 Winter Simulation Conf. IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, 319326) and Ribeiro and Webber (Ribeiro, C., N. Webber. 2004. Valuing path-dependent options in the variance-gamma model by Monte Carlo with a gamma bridge. J. Computational Finance7(2) 81100) is generalized to a multivariate (Dirichlet) construction, bridging simultaneously over all time partition points of the trajectory of a gamma process. The generation of the increments of the gamma process, given its value at the terminal point, is interpreted as a Dirichlet partition of the unit interval. The increments are generated in a decreasing stochastic order and, under the Kingman limit, have a known distribution. Thus, simulation of a trajectory from the gamma process requires generating only a small number of uniforms, avoiding the expensive simulation of beta variates via numerical probability integral inversion. The proposed method is then applied in simulating the trajectory of a VG process using its difference-of-gammas representation. It has been implemented in both plain Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo environments. It is tested in pricing lookback, barrier, and Asian options and is shown to provide consistent efficiency gains, compared to the sequential method and the difference-of-gammas bridge sampling proposed by Avramidis and L'Ecuyer (Avramidis, A. N., P. L'Ecuyer. 2006. Efficient Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo option pricing under the variance gamma model. Management Sci.52(12) 19301944).

## 13. Purchasing, Pricing, and Quick Response in the Presence of Strategic Consumers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
We consider a retailer that sells a product with uncertain demand over a finite selling season. The retailer sets an initial stocking quantity and, at some predetermined point in the season, optimally marks down remaining inventory. We modify this classic setting by introducing three types of consumers: myopic consumers, who always purchase at the initial full price; bargain-hunting consumers, who purchase only if the discounted price is sufficiently low; and strategic consumers, who strategically choose when to make their purchase. A strategic consumer chooses between a purchase at the initial full price and a later purchase at an uncertain markdown price. In equilibrium, strategic consumers and the retailer make optimal decisions given their rational expectations regarding future prices, availability of inventory, and the behavior of other consumers. We find that the retailer stocks less, takes smaller price discounts, and earns lower profit if strategic consumers are present than if there are no strategic consumers. We find that a retailer should generally avoid committing to a price path over the season (assuming such commitment is feasible)committing to a markdown price (or to not mark down at all) is often too costly (inventory may remain unsold) even in the presence of strategic consumers; the better approach is to be cautious with the initial quantity and then mark down optimally. Furthermore, we discuss the value of quick response (the ability to procure additional inventory after obtaining updated demand information, albeit at a higher unit cost than the initial order). We find that the value of quick response to a retailer is generally much greater in the presence of strategic consumers than without them: on average 67% more valuable and as much as 558% more valuable in our sample. In other words, although it is well established in the literature that quick response provides value by allowing better matching of supply with demand, it provides more value, often substantially more value, by allowing a retailer to control the negative consequences of strategic consumer behavior.
