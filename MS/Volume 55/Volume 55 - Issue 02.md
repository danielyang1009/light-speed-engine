## 2. Top Management Team Diversity and Firm Performance: Moderators of Functional-Background and Locus-of-Control Diversity
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Past research on the relationship between top management team (TMT) compositional diversity and organizational performance has paid insufficient attention to the nature of TMT team processes in interaction with TMT diversity. We fill this gap by studying how three team mechanisms (collaborative behavior, accurate information exchange, and decision-making decentralization) moderate the impact of TMT diversity on financial performance of 33 information technology firms. We focus on two fundamentally different forms of TMT diversity: functional-background (FB) and locus-of-control (LOC). We argue that the former has the potential to enhance decision quality and organizational performance, whereas the latter might trigger relational conflict, and is, therefore, potentially detrimental to firm effectiveness. The ultimate aim of our study is to analyze which team processes help to transform distributed FB knowledge into high-quality decisions and organizational effectiveness, and which help avoid the potential detrimental effects of LOC diversity. We find that a TMT's collaborative behavior and information exchange are necessary conditions to unleash the performance benefits of FB diversity, but do not interact with LOC diversity. In addition, decentralized decision making spurs the effectiveness of functionally diverse teams, while at the same time reinforces the negative consequences of LOC diversity on firm performance.

## 3. Masters of War: Rivals' Product Innovation and New Advertising in Mature Product Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We investigate the impact of rivals' product innovation and new advertising on a firm's financial market value in mature product markets. Our test bed is the carbonated soft drink market between 1999 and 2003, a period characterized by a near duopoly between Coca-Cola and Pespi. Empirically, we focus on new product announcements as a proxy of product innovation and on filed trademarks as a measure of new advertising. We find that rival product announcements decrease a firm's financial market value, and that rival filed trademarks increase it. Finally, we find that the effect of new advertising is channeled through market size dynamics, while that of product innovation operates through market share dynamics. Results are robust across different estimation techniques (event study, Tobin's q) and model specifications.

### Abstract:
We study a manufacturer that faces a supplier privileged with private information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information.

## 5. Scanning the Commons? Evidence on the Benefits to Startups Participating in Open Standards Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
This paper contributes large-sample evidence to an emerging discussion on open innovation and firm strategy. We ask why a startup should participate in an open standards community. We propose four ways that participation might increase a startup's chances of a liquidity event: gaining endorsement of the startup's technology standard, openly developing the startup's technology within the community (but not necessarily gaining endorsement), simply attending physical meetings of the community, and having startup members elected to leadership positions. Examination of venture-funded startups in the networking/data communications industry sectors reveals that those startups that participate in an open standards community (the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)) have a greater likelihood of an initial public offering or acquisition. The strongest effects are due to attendance, and conditional on high levels of attendance, holding leadership positions within the IETF. Surprisingly, standards endorsement is insignificant when controlling for simple physical attendance. These results are robust to instrumental variable methods and alternative coding of variables. In two-stage models we also find that prominent venture capitalists might help their portfolio companies by steering them to effective technology strategies, in this case active participation in the IETF, and not simply by lending status.

## 6. SEC Rule 10b5-1 and Insiders' Strategic Trade
### Author(s):
- Alan D. Jagolinzer
### Published:
- 17 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Rule 10b5-1 to deter insiders from trading with private information, yet also protect insiders' preplanned, non-information-based trades from litigation. Despite its requirement that insiders plan trades when not privately informed, the rule appears to enable strategic trade. Participating insiders' sales systematically follow positive and precede negative firm performance, generating abnormal forward-looking returns larger than those earned by nonparticipating colleagues. The observed association does not appear to be explained by market transaction disclosure response, predictable reversion following positive performance, or general periodic price declines. There is evidence, however, that a substantive proportion of randomly drawn plan initiations are associated with pending adverse news disclosures. There is also evidence that early sales plan terminations are associated with pending positive performance shifts, reducing the likelihood that insiders' sales execute at low prices. Collectively, this suggests that, on average, trading within the rule does not solely reflect uninformed diversification.

## 7. Performance Analysis of a Queue with Congestion-Based Staffing Policy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes a waiting line system that is motivated by the operations of border-crossing stations between the United States and Canada. There are two main conflicting goals in such a system: high security level, which often leads to a longer line; and good customer service, which requires a shorter line. Thus, unlike other queueing systems, maintaining the average queue length within a certain range is the primary objective. This is achieved using a staffing policy, called congestion-based staffing, or CBS, where the number of servers (inspection booths) is adjusted according to the queue length during a planning period. We first present an exact benchmark model of Markovian type based on the matrix-geometric solution. For practical CBS policies, we develop a set of closed-form formulas for the major performance measures based on regenerative cycle analysis and fluid limit approximation. Numerical examples show that these approximation formulas are simple, accurate, and robust for practitioners to use in designing CBS policies.

## 8. Dynamic Programming Approach for Valuing Options in the GARCH Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to value options under discrete-time GARCH processes. We propose a procedure based on dynamic programming coupled with piecewise polynomial approximation to compute the value of a given option, at all observation dates and levels of the state vector. The method can be used for the large GARCH family of models based on Gaussian innovations and may accommodate all low-dimensional European as well as American derivatives. Numerical implementations show that this method competes very advantageously with other available valuation methods.

## 9. Modeling of Workflow Congestion and Optimization of Flow Routing in a Manufacturing/Warehouse Facility
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the notion of workflow congestion in the context of material handling equipment interruptions in a manufacturing or warehousing facility. Development of a combination of probabilistic and physics-based models for workflow interruptions permits evaluation of the expected link travel time. The problem is then of routing in a way that minimizes total expected travel time. The rerouting problem is modeled as a multicommodity flow problem with link capacity design. A greedy upper bounding and Lagrangean relaxation algorithm are developed to solve this efficiently. To calibrate our modeling process we develop an object-oriented simulation model that explicitly considers various workflow interruptions. Our major finding is that rerouting traffic in a congested facility can significantly alleviate congestion delays and improve the efficiency of material movement. A managerial insight derived from this work is that rerouting is most effective in medium traffic-intensity situations.

## 10. Simulating Sensitivities of Conditional Value at Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 5 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
Conditional value at risk (CVaR) is both a coherent risk measure and a natural risk statistic. It is often used to measure the risk associated with large losses. In this paper, we study how to estimate the sensitivities of CVaR using Monte Carlo simulation. We first prove that the CVaR sensitivity can be written as a conditional expectation for general loss distributions. We then propose an estimator of the CVaR sensitivity and analyze its asymptotic properties. The numerical results show that the estimator works well. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the estimator to solve optimization problems with CVaR objective and/or constraints, and compare it to a popular linear programming-based algorithm.

## 11. Maintaining Diagnostic Knowledge-Based Systems: A Control-Theoretic Approach

### Published:

### Abstract:
Diagnostic knowledge-based systems are used in a variety of application domains to support classification decisions. The effectiveness of such systems often decreases as the application environment or user preferences change over time. Hence, frequent adjustments to the system knowledge by a human expert become necessary. We study the problem of determining the optimal amount of effort that should be exerted to maintain the system over a planning horizon (finite or infinite). Using the receiver operating characteristic curve to derive a measure for system performance, we maximize system value by balancing system benefits with maintenance costs. The problem is cast as an optimal control model in which the goal is to choose the timing and extent of maintenance that must be expended to maximize system value. We find that the optimal solution usually possesses a steady-state component. The maintenance problem is also solved as a discrete, impulse control problem, as well as one where maintenance effort has a nonlinear impact on system performance.

## 12. Complementarity Among Vertical Integration Decisions: Evidence from Automobile Product Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
This paper examines complementarity among vertical integration decisions in automobile product development. Though most research assumes that contracting choices are independent of each other, contracting complementarity arises when the returns to a single vertical integration decision are increasing in the level of vertical integration associated with other contracting choices. First, effective coordination may depend on the level of (noncontractible) effort on the part of each agent; contracting complementarity results if coordination efforts are interdependent and vertical integration facilitates a higher level of noncontractible effort. Second, effective coordination may require the disclosure of proprietary trade secrets, and the potential for expropriation by external suppliers may induce complementarity among vertical integration choices. We provide evidence for complementarity in product development contracting by taking advantage of a detailed data set that includes the level of vertical integration and the contracting environment for individual automobile systems in the luxury automobile segment. Using an instrumental variables framework that distinguishes complementarity from unobserved firm-level factors, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that contracting complementarity is an important driver of vertical integration choices. The findings suggest that contracting complementarity may be particularly important when coordination is important to achieve but difficult to monitor.
