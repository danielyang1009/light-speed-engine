## 2. Are We Wise About the Wisdom of Crowds? The Use of Group Judgments in Belief Revision
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
Recent research has advanced our understanding of how people use the advice of others to update their beliefs. Because groups and teams play a significant role in organizations and collectively are wiser than their individual members, it is important to understand their influence on belief revision as well. I report the results of four studies examining intuitions about group wisdom and the informational influence of groups. In their overt assessments, experimental participants rated larger groups as more accurate than smaller groups and discriminated more between them when group size was salient. When provided advice, participants relied more on groups than individuals to update their beliefs, but were only modestly sensitive to group size. Most were suboptimal in the use of that advice, overweighting their initial beliefs and underweighting the more valid judgment of the group. Thus although acknowledged in principle, the wisdom of crowds is only shallowly manifest in observed behavior.

## 3. Price-Dependent Profit Sharing as a Channel Coordination Device

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
We show how an upstream firm, by using a price-dependent profit-sharing rule, can prevent destructive competition between downstream firms that produce relatively close substitutes. With this rule, the upstream firm induces the retailers to behave as if demand has become less price elastic. As a result, competing downstream firms will maximize aggregate total channel profit. When downstream firms are better informed about demand conditions than the upstream firm, the same outcome cannot be achieved by vertical restraints such as resale price maintenance. Price-dependent profit sharing may also ensure that the downstream firms undertake efficient market expanding investments. The model is consistent with observations from the market for content commodities distributed by mobile networks.

## 4. Unspanned Stochastic Volatility in Affine Models: Evidence from Eurodollar Futures and Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
Unspanned stochastic volatility (USV) refers to the inability of bonds to replicate volatility-sensitive derivative securities. Affine term structure models require special restrictions on the parameters to exhibit USV. We use a joint Eurodollar futures and options data set to estimate affine three-factor models with and without USV restrictions. The unrestricted model captures prices of futures and options well. Option pricing errors are much larger in the USV model. The USV model is rejected in favor of the unrestricted model based on the likelihood ratio and Wald tests. We use the implications of the unrestricted model as a benchmark for understanding the extant evidence that favors USV. Specifically, we replicate extant tests in samples simulated from the unrestricted model. We show that none of the existing findings contradict the model without USV restrictions.

## 5. Relative Performance Compensation, Contests, and Dynamic Incentives
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
Contests (or tournaments) are pervasive in organizations. They help performance evaluation by eliminating common shocks affecting agents' performance. However, tournaments are less effective when participants have heterogeneous ability because participants may conclude that the ability gap is too large to be overcome by their effort. Our theoretical analysis shows that a similar loss of motivation arises when tournaments take place over multiple periods because interim performance acts in a way that is similar to heterogeneous ability. Analyzing the sales contests organized by a commodities company, we document that winning participants decrease their effort as their lead extends, whereas the effort of trailing participants fades only when the gap to a winning position is very large. We also show that, on average, when contests are introduced they induce a higher level of effort among participants, although the incentives weaken as the number of participants increases. Finally, we demonstrate that although retailers respond to the multiple performance dimensions of the incentive program in part by shifting effort toward sales of more expensive products, they channel most of the increased effort toward reaching more customers.

## 6. Arms Race or Dtente? How Interfirm Alliance Announcements Change the Stock Market Valuation of Rivals
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
Most prior event studies find that the announcement of a new alliance is accompanied by a positive stock market response for the partners. This result has usually been interpreted as evidence for the prevailing view that alliances are effective vehicles for partners to acquire or access new skills and thus become stronger competitors. However, partners should also earn positive abnormal returns if alliances are used to shape competitive interactions, attenuating competitive intensity industry-wide.

## 7. Product Variety and Endogenous Pricing with Evaluation Costs
### Author(s):
- J. Miguel Villas-Boas
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
One important decision firms must make is to select the product line (characteristics and number of products) to offer consumers. This paper explores the effect of the interaction between consumer evaluation costs and pricing on the optimal product line length to offer consumers. Before deciding to buy a product among all products offered, a consumer learns the product line length. Given the product line length, a consumer decides whether to evaluate the products available and their prices. This decision to evaluate depends on the expected consumer surplus after the evaluation being greater than the evaluation costs. When the firm offers few products, the firm may not attract many consumers because of lack of product fit and may be forced to offer low prices. When the firm offers many products, all consumers will find a great product fit; that is, the variance of consumer valuations per product chosen is lower. This allows the firm to charge high prices to extract ex post consumer surplus, resulting in lower ex ante expected consumer surplus, which may lead consumers not to evaluate the products in the first place. That is, by offering fewer products a firm can commit not to extract all possible consumer surplus. These two forces may then lead to the existence of an interior optimal number of products to offer. The optimal number of products offered is decreasing in the evaluation costs.

## 8. Optimal Price and Product Quality Decisions in a Distribution Channel
### Author(s):
- Xiaowei Xu
### Published:
- 14 May 2009
### Abstract:
This paper studies a joint pricing and product quality decision problem in a distribution channel, in which a manufacturer sells a product through a retailer. The manufacturer jointly determines the wholesale price and quality of the product, and the retailer determines the retail price. We find that if the marginal revenue function is strictly concave, then the manufacturer chooses a lower product quality level than if selling the product directly to customers. If the marginal revenue function is affine, then the manufacturer's optimal product quality decision is independent of the distribution channel structure. If the marginal revenue function is strictly convex, then the manufacturer chooses a higher product quality level than if selling the product directly to customers.

## 9. Responding to Unexpected Overloads in Large-Scale Service Systems

### Published:
- 18 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
We consider how two networked large-scale service systems that normally operate separately, such as call centers, can help each other when one encounters an unexpected overload and is unable to immediately increase its own staffing. Our proposed control activates serving some customers from the other system when a ratio of the two queue lengths (numbers of waiting customers) exceeds a threshold. Two thresholds, one for each direction of sharing, automatically detect the overload condition and prevent undesired sharing under normal loads. After a threshold has been exceeded, the control aims to keep the ratio of the two queue lengths at a specified value. To gain insight, we introduce an idealized stochastic model with two customer classes and two associated service pools containing large numbers of agents. To set the important queue-ratio parameters, we consider an approximating deterministic fluid model. We determine queue-ratio parameters that minimize convex costs for this fluid model. We perform simulation experiments to show that the control is effective for the original stochastic model. Indeed, the simulations show that the proposed queue-ratio control with thresholds outperforms the optimal fixed partition of the servers given known fixed arrival rates during the overload, even though the proposed control does not use information about the arrival rates.

## 10. Product Differentiation, Store Differentiation, and Assortment Depth
### Author(s):
- Stephen F. Hamilton
- Timothy J. Richards
### Published:
- 18 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
This paper considers the relationship between product differentiation, store differentiation, and the equilibrium depth of the product assortment. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between product differentiation and assortment depth, with the depth of the assortment rising at first and then falling with the degree of product differentiation. For product categories that consist of relatively nondifferentiatied variants, a positive relationship arises between assortment depth and category sales, whereas a negative relationship emerges between assortment depth and sales in categories with more differentiated variants. Both the extent and manner in which store differentiation changes has important implications for assortment depth. If retailer market power is augmented following the closure of rival retailers, product assortments become deeper; however, if retailers gain market power by investing in store attributes that facilitate customer loyalty, product assortments become shallower.

## 11. Experimentation in Financial Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
In this paper, we use a unique data set on the Italian interdealer bond market to empirically estimate the process of strategic experimentation. The results show how the information generated in the process of interdealer trading affects the incentive to experiment. Upon receipt of an order, dealers deliberately engage in trade with other dealers either to exploit the information contained in the order they receive or, if they are uncertain about its quality, to assess it by actively experimenting with other dealers. We therefore identify hiding and experimenting as main types of dealer strategies.

## 12. Optimal Markdown Pricing: Implications of Inventory Display Formats in the Presence of Strategic Customers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
We propose a game-theoretical model of a retailer who sells a limited inventory of a product over a finite selling season by using one of two inventory display formats: display all (DA) and display one (DO). Under DA, the retailer displays all available units so that each arriving customer has perfect information about the actual inventory level. Under DO, the retailer displays only one unit at a time so that each customer knows about product availability but not the actual inventory level. Recent research suggests that when faced with strategic consumers, the retailer could increase expected profits by making an upfront commitment to a price path. We focus on such pricing strategies in this paper, and study the potential benefit of DO compared to DA, and its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We find support for our hypothesis that the DO format could potentially create an increased sense of shortage risk, and hence it is better than the DA format. However, although potentially beneficial, a move from DA to DO is typically very far from eliminating the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior. We observe that, generally, it is not important for a retailer to modify the level of inventory when moving from a DA to a DO format; a change in the display format, along with an appropriate price modification, is typically sufficient. Interestingly, across all scenarios in which a change in inventory is significantly beneficial, we observed that only one of the following two actions takes place: either the premium price is increased along with a reduction in inventory, or inventory is increased along with premium price reduction. We find that the marginal benefit of DO can vary dramatically as a function of the per-unit cost to the retailer. In particular, when the retailer's per-unit cost is relatively high, but not too high to make sales unprofitable or to justify exclusive sales to high-valuation customers only, the benefits of DO appear to be at their highest level, and could reach up to 20% increase in profit. Finally, we demonstrate that by moving from DA to DO, while keeping the price path unchanged, the volatility of the retailer's profit decreases.

## 13. Application-Specific R&D Capabilities and the Advantage of Incumbents: Evidence from the Anticancer Drug Market
### Author(s):
- M. Lourdes Sosa
### Published:
- 26 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
This paper examines the proposition that during competence-destroying technological changes, incumbents are incompetent in researching in house a radically new technology. They only retain market leadership if their undestroyed, proprietary complementary assets compensate for their research incompetence. In contrast to prior research, I propose that there is not one but two sets of capabilities necessary to execute research and development (R&D), sets that differ in their market specificity: a technology-specific set (i.e., technological platforms that are non-market specific) and an application-specific set (i.e., knowledge of the application that is therefore market specific). Although all markets require both sets of capabilities to execute R&D, prior research has analyzed cases where the application was not as complex, and therefore application-specific capabilities did not represent strategic factors. Because at the start of a technological discontinuity application-specific capabilities are undestroyed and have accrued only to incumbents, when complex enough, these capabilities can represent a source of competitive advantage for these firms, even in the face of competition from diversifying entrants reusing previously acquired technological platforms. I find evidence consistent with my proposition based on data on outcomes from drug discovery (as estimated through clinical endpoints in phase I trials) for firms competing in the anticancer drug market, one of the most complex markets within pharmaceuticals, as the market transitions into the biotechnology revolution. The proposition in this paper implies that although technological platforms can help firms move across markets, application-specific R&D capabilities can help firms retain leadership within a market across technological discontinuities.

## 14. Ultimatum Deadlines
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
An important characteristic of any offer is the deadline at which it expires. We consider an ultimatum deadline game in which the proposer's decision variable is the offer deadline, while the responder faces a standard finite-horizon search problem. We show that the responder's strategy is characterized by a shortest acceptable deadline: at the time of deadline, he accepts an offer if the deadline is longer than his shortest acceptable deadline, and rejects it otherwise. If the proposer has all information available to the responder, the optimal deadline is the responder's shortest acceptable deadline. If the proposer is uncertain about the responder's situation, the optimal deadline gets longer, unless this uncertainty is very large. After normative analysis of the deadline setting problem, we present results from a behavioral study of the game. The average shortest acceptable deadline set by the responders equals the one that would maximize the expected value, whereas the proposers tend to set deadlines that are too short. The prescriptive conclusion for a proposer, emerging from the model and the experiment, is that in case of uncertainty it is better to set a deadline longer than what would be optimal if uncertainty were ignored.

## 15. Asymptotic Normality for EMS Option Price Estimator with Continuous or Discontinuous Payoff Functions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2009
### Abstract:
Empirical martingale simulation (EMS) was proposed by Duan and Simonato (Duan, J.-C., J.-G. Simonato. 1998. Empirical martingale simulation for asset prices. Management Sci.44(9) 12181233) as an adjustment to the standard Monte Carlo simulation to reduce simulation errors. The EMS price estimator of derivative contracts was shown to be asymptotically normally distributed in Duan et al. (Duan, J.-C., G. Gauthier, J.-G. Simonato. 2001. Asymptotic distribution of the EMS option price estimator. Management Sci.47(8) 11221132) when the payoffs are piecewise linear and continuous. In this paper, we extend the asymptotic normality result to more general continuous payoffs, and for discontinuous payoffs we make a conjecture.
