### Published:

### Abstract:
We focus on backup agreements between a catalog company and manufacturersa scheme to provide upstream sourcing flexibility for fashion merchandise. A backup agreement states that if the catalog company commits to a number of units for the season, the manufacturer holds back a constant fraction of the commitment and delivers the remaining units before the start of the fashion season. After observing early demand, the catalog company can order up to this backup quantity for the original purchase cost and receive quick delivery but will pay a penalty cost for any of the backup units it does not buy. In representative contracts with five companies, the fraction held as backup varies from 20% to 33% and the penalty ranges from 0 to 20% of cost. We model this inventory problem and derive the optimal solution. We provide results from a retrospective parallel test of the model against buyer decisions in 1993 based on a data set from the women's fashion department at a catalog company (Catco). The results indicate that backup arrangements can have a substantial impact on expected profits and may result in an increase in the committed quantity. Also, these arrangements may maintain the manufacturer's expected profit for a wide range of parameters.

## 2. New Benchmark Results for the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Erik L. Demeulemeester
- Willy S. Herroelen
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
This paper reports on new insights derived from computational results obtained with an updated version of the branch-and-bound procedure previously developed by Demeulemeester and Herroelen (Demeulemeester, E., W. Herroelen. 1992. A branch-and-bound procedure for the multiple resource-constrained project scheduling problem. Management Sci.38 18031818.) for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). The new code fully exploits the advantages of 32-bit programming provided by recent compilers running on platforms such as Windows NT and OS/2: flat memory, increased addressable memory, and fast program execution. We study the impact of three important variables on the computation time for the RCPSP: addressable computer memory, the search strategy (depth-first, best-first, or hybrid), and the introduction of a stronger lower bound. We compare the results obtained by a truncated branch-and-bound procedure with the results generated by the minimum slack time heuristic and report on the dependency of its solution quality on the allotted CPU time.

## 3. Catching the Wave: Alertness, Responsiveness, and Market Influence in Global Electronic Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
This paper introduces the concepts of alertness and responsiveness as key capabilities for firms in fast-moving, information-intensive environments such as global currency trading. Hypotheses drawn from the resource-based view of the firm, from network theory, and from Austrian economics are tested on objective cross-section and time-series data for the population of 4,088 banks engaged in foreign-exchange trading on the Reuters dealing system. Results strongly support the hypotheses that banks that are alert, i.e., use their information networks in ways that expand the range of information they are exposed to, and responsivethose that act quickly in volatile marketstend to exercise greater market influence in this industry.

## 4. Meta-Analysis of the Impact of Research Methods on Findings of First-Mover Advantage
### Author(s):
- Pieter A. VanderWerf
- John F. Mahon
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
A long-standing hypothesis is that firms that enter a market early (first movers) tend to have higher performance than their followers (first-mover advantage). Recently, researchers have begun to argue that the statistical tests that support this relationship are limited in their applicability. That is, it is suggested that because of the methods used, these tests show the relationship only for certain subsets of firms, markets, and types of performance.

## 5. A Polyhedral Approach to the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem
### Author(s):
- Matteo Fischetti
- Paolo Toth
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
Several branch-and-bound algorithms for the exact solution of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP), based on the assignment problem (AP) relaxation, have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms perform very well for some instances (e.g., those with uniformly random integer costs), but very poorly for others. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of a branch-and-cut algorithm exploiting ATSP-specific facet-defining cuts, to be used to attack hard instances that cannot be solved by the AP-based procedures from the literature. We present new separation algorithms for some classes of facet-defining cuts, and a new variable-pricing technique for dealing with highly degenerate primal LP problems. A branch-and-cut algorithm based on these new results is designed and evaluated through computational analysis on several classes of both random and real-world instances. The outcome of the research is that, on hard instances, the branch-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms the best AP-based algorithms from the literature.

## 6. Autocorrelated Returns and Optimal Intertemporal Portfolio Choice
### Author(s):
- Ronald J. Balvers
- Douglas W. Mitchell
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
In recent years it has been shown empirically that stock returns exhibit positive or negative autocorrelation, depending on observation frequency. In this context of autocorrelated returns the present paper is the first to derive an explicit analytical solution to the dynamic portfolio problem of an individual agent saving for retirement (or other change of status, like the purchase of a house or starting college). Using a normal ARMA(1,1) process, dynamic programming techniques combined with the use of Stein's Lemma are employed to examine dollar-cost-averaging and age effects in intertemporal portfolio choice with CARA preferences. We show that with a positive moving average parameter and positive riskfree rates, if first-order serial correlation is nonnegative, then the expected value of the optimal risky investment is increasing over time, while if first-order serial correlation is negative this path can be increasing or decreasing over time. Thus a necessary but not sufficient condition to obtain the conventional age effect of increasing conservatism over time is that first-order serial correlation be negative. Further, dollar-cost averaging in the general sense of gradual entry into the risky asset does not emerge as an optimal policy. Simulation results for U.S. data are used to illustrate optimal portfolio paths.

## 7. Habits and the Anomalies in Intertemporal Choice
### Author(s):
- Luc Wathieu
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes a model of discounted utility under habit formation. Habit formation means that utility in each period is determined by the difference between the received outcome and the customary outcome at that point in time. Preferences are rational, in the sense that the decision maker correctly anticipates the habit formation process and behaves in a dynamically consistent manner, i.e., plans are truly carried out. The purpose is to demonstrate that this generalization of the discounted utility model accounts, jointly and in a meaningful way, for the most striking anomalies with respect to classical discounted utility theory. The common difference effect is explained first. This effect, also called decreasing impatience effect, has usually been viewed as evidence against exponential discounting. Then, the frequently observed preference for increasing sequences of outcomes is examined. Such preference, under the traditional discounted utility model, would be regarded as a paradoxical case of negative discounting. A discussion of the descriptive, prescriptive, and normative values of the model is included.

## 8. Intraday Volatility in International Stock Index Futures Markets: Meteor Showers or Heat Waves?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
The international transmission of intraday price volatility among the United States, United Kingdom, and Japanese stock index futures markets in the period 19881994 is investigated in this paper. The empirical results based on extreme-value estimators and vector autoregression indicate the rapid transmission of information between markets. The volatilities of the U.S. and U.K. futures markets appear to follow a meteor shower rather than a heat wave type of process. This means that these volatilities react to shocks from other markets, i.e., they cannot be described only by their past values. However, the heat wave hypothesis is not rejected for the Japanese market, meaning that the shocks to Japanese volatility are mostly country-specific. A multivariate GARCH model supports the U.K. and Japanese but not the U.S. results.

## 9. Analysis of a Production/Inventory System Subject to Random Disruptions
### Author(s):
- Kamran Moinzadeh
- Prabhu Aggarwal
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
In this paper we study an unreliable bottleneck production/inventory system with a constant production and demand rate that is subject to random disruptions. We assume that the restoration times are constant, the time between breakdowns is exponential, the production setup cost and/or setup time is positive, and excess demand is backordered. We propose an (s, S) production policy for such systems and develop expressions for the operating characteristics of the system. The properties of the policy parameters that minimize the expected total cost rate are investigated and a procedure for finding their optimal values is developed. In addition, we devise and test a simple heuristic procedure for finding near optimal production policies. The results of a numerical experiment suggest that (i) setup cost reduction is more effective in reducing total operating cost when the production system is more reliable, (ii) setup cost reduction in unreliable production systems results in higher optimal safety stock level, and (iii) proper determination of the safety stock levels is extremely important in Just-in-Time systems, which are susceptible to disruptions.

## 10. Path-Dependent Options: Extending the Monte Carlo Simulation Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
Monte Carlo simulation has been used to value options since Boyle's seminal paper. Monte Carlo simulation, however, has not been used to its fullest extent for option valuation because of the belief that the method is not feasible for American-style options. This paper demonstrates how to incorporate optimal early exercise in the Monte Carlo method of valuing options by linking forward-moving simulation and the backward-moving recursion of dynamic programming through an iterative search process. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we use it to value American-style options on the average price (or Asian options). The computational experience reveals a flexible valuation technique with potential for application to a range of securities and financial decision problems.

## 11. Note: Dynamic Conjectural Variations in a Lanchester Oligopoly
### Author(s):
- Gary M. Erickson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1997
### Abstract:
An approach based on dynamic conjectural variations is advanced for developing dynamic advertising strategies in a Lanchester oligopoly differential game. The approach allows competitors to anticipate rival reactions to market-share state variables, and maintains the computational advantage of open-loop Nash equilibrium strategies. In an empirical application to the ready-to-eat cereal industry, it is shown that advertising strategies based on dynamic conjectural variations can better explain the advertising of the cereal competitors than can open- loop advertising strategies.
