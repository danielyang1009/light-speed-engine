## 1. Perceived Risk Attitudes: Relating Risk Perception to Risky Choice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
This paper provides empirical evidence that distinguishes between alternative conceptualizations of the risky decision making process. Two studies investigate whether cross-situational differences in choice behavior should be interpreted in the expected utility framework as differences in risk attitude (as measured by risk-averse vs. risk-seeking utility functions) or as differences in the perception of the relative riskiness of choice alternatives as permitted by risk-return interpretations of utility functions, leaving open the possibility of stable cross-situational risk preference as a personality trait. To this end, we propose a way of assessing a person's inherent risk preference that factors out individual and situational differences in risk perception. We document that a definition of risk aversion and risk seeking as the preference for options perceived to be more risky or less risky, respectively, provides the cross-situational stability to a person's risk preference that has eluded more traditional definitions. In Experiment 1, commuters changed their preferences for trains with risky arrival times when the alternatives involved gains in commuting time rather than losses. However, changes in preference coincided with changes in the perception of the riskiness of the choice alternatives, leaving the perceived risk attitudes of a majority of commuters unchanged. Experiment 2, a stockmarket investment task, investigated changes in risk perception, information acquisition, and stock selection as a function of outcome feedback. Investors' stock selections and their perception of the risk of the same stocks were different in a series of decisions in which they lost money than in a series in which they made money. As in Experiment 1, differences in choice and in risk perception were systematically related, such that the majority of investors had the same preference for perceived risk in both series of decisions. Our results provide empirical support for the usefulness of recent risk-return conceptualizations of risky choice (Bell [Bell, D. E. 1995. Risk, return, and utility. Management Sci.41 2330.], Jia and Dyer [Jia, J., J. S. Dyer. 1994. A standard measure of risk and risk-value models. Working paper, University of Texas at Austin.], M. Weber and Sarin 1993).

## 2. Fleet Sizing and Empty Equipment Redistribution for Center-Terminal Transportation Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
Fleet sizing and empty equipment redistribution are important issues in managing transportation systems. Most of the mathematical models that have been developed for these problems are complex and computationally demanding, including dynamic linear programming and stochastic/dynamic mathematical programs. Our research takes an alternate approach by building from inventory theory and developing decentralized stock control policies for empty equipment. This approach is applied to hub-and-spoke networks (i.e., center-terminal networks), by first analytically modeling the stochastic processes representing various stock-control variables, and then comparing the analytical results to monte-carlo simulations. A decomposition approach is also developed to determine stock-out probabilities as a function of the fleet size as a whole, and as a function of localized control parameters.

## 3. Scheduling Workforce and Workflow in a High Volume Factory
### Author(s):
- Oded Berman
- Richard C. Larson
- Edieal Pinker
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
We define a high volume factory to be a connected network of workstations, at which assigned workers process work-in-progress that flows at high rates through the workstations. A high rate usually implies that each worker processes many pieces per hour, enough so that work can be described as a deterministic hourly flow rate rather than, say, a stochastic number of discrete entities. Examples include mail processing and sorting, check processing, telephoned order processing, and inspecting and packaging of certain foods. Exogenous work may enter the factory at any workstation according to any time-of-day profile. Work-in-progress flows through the factory in discrete time according to Markovian routings. Workers, who in general are cross-trained, may work part time or full time shifts, may start work only at designated shift starting times, and may change job assignments at mid shift. In order to smooth the flow of work-in-progress through the service factory, work-in-progress may be temporarily inventoried (in buffers) at work stations. The objective is to schedule the workers (and correspondingly, the workflow) in a manner that minimizes labor costs subject to a variety of service-level, contractual and physical constraints. Motivated in part by analysis techniques of discrete time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, an object-oriented linear programming (OOLP) model is developed. Using exogenous input work profiles typical of large U.S. mail processing facilities, illustrative computational results are included.

## 4. An Optimal Policy for a Two Depot Inventory Problem with Stock Transfer
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
Multiple depot inventory systems with stock transfer are used by many companies especially when demand is high relative to storage capacity. The key issues in such systems are how many of each item to hold at each depot and what to do if there is a demand for an item at a depot that has none of that item in stock. This study was motivated by the inventory problem faced by a UK car part retailer that groups its depots into pairs. The company's policy for dealing with a demand at a depot that cannot be satisfied from local stock is to either transfer the item from the other depot in the group or to place an emergency order. The object of this paper is to characterise an optimal policy for this problem and to propose a method of calculating the parameters of such a policy.

## 5. An Inventory Model Embedded in Designing a Supply Contract
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
To reduce lead-time and its variability, modern supply and transportation contracts often specify the frequency of, and volume available for, future deliveries in advance even when final demand is somewhat uncertain (Yano and Gerchak [Yano, C. A., Y. Gerchak. 1989. Transportation contracts and safety stocks for just-in-time deliveries. Manufacturing and Oper. Management2 314330.]). We explore the joint optimization of contract parameters and inventory control policy in such environments. We first model and derive the optimal periodic review inventory policy corresponding to a given supply contract, which generates piecewise-linear convex ordering costs. The optimal policy has two critical levels, and there is a range of stock levels for which the quantity ordered equals the contract volume. To numerically compute the critical levels, we model consecutive inventory levels as a Markov Chain, whose steady-state distribution is used to compute the holding, shortage and transportation costs. We then use the resulting total costs to derive the optimal contract volume. Various examples are provided. The optimal contracted delivery frequency can also be computed.

## 6. A Stochastic Version of a Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot Equilibrium Model
### Author(s):
- Daniel De Wolf
- Yves Smeers
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
We consider a stochastic version of the Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot model proposed by Murphy et al. (Murphy, F. H., H. D. Sherali, A. L. Soyester. 1983. Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibria characterizations and computations. Oper. Res.31 253276.). In the first stage, the leader chooses and announces his production level taking into account the reaction of the followers. The decision of the leader is taken when market demand is uncertain. In the second stage, the followers, knowing the leader's output, react to this level according to the Cournot assumption. At this stage, demand is known. We study the extension of the Murphy et al. model and give a numerical illustration of this model using the European gas market.

## 7. On the Relative Importance of Duration Constraints
### Author(s):
- Jacob Paroush
- Eliezer Z. Prisman
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
This paper uncovers an implicit assumption, and its implications, made in the process of maximizing yield (or minimizing costs) subject to the duration constraints. Using linear programming results, it is shown that this technique is sensible only if the yield of a bond is a linear function of its duration measures. Utilizing this result the paper analyzes the relative importance of the duration constraints. Former studies have hinted that the first order duration may be the most important. It is shown here there is no reason to satisfy the first duration constraint with priority over satisfaction of a higher order duration constraint. Practitioners who use duration techniques for portfolio immunization must be aware of such an important counter-intuitive result.

- Paolo Pianca
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
In this paper efficient bounds for the price of a call option are obtained using the decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) dominance rule. Such lower and upper bounds are obtained minimizing and maximizing, respectively, the objective function of a nonlinear optimization problem. An explicit formula (related to an exponential utility function) is given for the special case of three states of nature.

## 9. Organizational Response: The Cost Performance Tradeoff
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
Organizations constantly face a dynamic environment where they must respond both quickly and accurately in order to survive. In this paper, we examine the issue: do organizations need to employ costly designs in order to exhibit high performance in a dynamic situation. In the context of a computational framework we derive a set of logically consistent propositions about the interrelationship among task, opportunities for review, training, and cost and their relative impact on organizational performance. Our analyses indicate that complex organizational designs have drawbacks and design is often not the dominant factor affecting performance. The relationship between organizational complexity (hence cost) and performance is complex and depends on the level of time pressure, training, and the task environment. Within the context of the computational framework, we find that the benefits of re-thinking decisions and of matching the organizational design to the task environment are questionable. Further, these results suggest that applying scarce resources to mitigate the adverse impact of time pressure may have more impact on performance than using those resources to support a more complex organizational design.

## 10. Static and Dynamic Time-Space Strategic Models and Algorithms for Multilevel Rail-Car Fleet Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the design of dynamic time-space and calibrated static strategic planning models, along with solution algorithms, for the multilevel rail-car fleet management problem faced by RELOAD, a branch of the Association of American Railroads (AAR). We discuss a prevalent fleet sizing management model that is static in nature, and propose an alternative dynamic model based on a time-space network representation. This model accurately represents the problem, and also provides information regarding the issue of storing and retrieving empty cars. A suitable decomposition heuristic, that is based on solving subproblems defined for overlapping time segments, is developed to solve this model. This heuristic is shown to recover an optimal solution for all the test problems with a reasonable effort. We also investigate a procedure for calibrating the static model based on this improved time-space representation. Our results show that for the static model, a calibrated use of available data can yield near-optimal total fleet size requirements. This enables the use of such a simple, calibrated static model for accurately conducting fleet sizing, the determination of fleet size allocations among railroads, as well as for analyzing various what-if scenarios. The proposed methodology is being currently implemented at the AAR, and the status of this process as well as some test results are presented.

## 11. Note. Optimal Promotion Strategies: A Demand-Sided Characterization
### Author(s):
- Duncan Simester
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1997
### Abstract:
We generalize Narasimhan's (Narasimhan, Chakravarthi. 1988. Competitive promotional strategies. J. Bus.61(4) 427449.) model of retail promotion to include multiple products and general demand functions. Doing so allows us to further characterize optimal promotion strategies. We find that firms prefer to offer deeper promotions on products for which switching customers have stronger demand than loyal customers and/or for which the price sensitivity of demand is high for both switching and loyal customers. We further show that firms will offer deeper promotions on products which enjoy complementary relationships with other products that they sell rather than on products for which the firm sells a substitute.
