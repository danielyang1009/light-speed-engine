## 1. Moral Hazard in Corporate Investment and the Disciplinary Role of Voluntary Capital Rationing
### Author(s):
- Guochang Zhang
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
This paper compares three capital-budgeting rules, the NPV rule, a high hurdle rate and capital rationing, and explains why some firms may voluntarily impose capital rationing. Under both capital rationing and a high hurdle, a restrictive investment criterion is used to control managerial shirking. However, implementation of these budgeting rules requires a mechanism to prevent the firm from expanding the investment scale ex post. Capital rationing, in the form of a predetermined, fixed budget, differs from the high-hurdle-rate rule in that the former requires the firm to overcome the cost of raising additional capital before making further investment.

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
We address an assembly problem, motivated by flat panel display manufacturing, where the quality (or performance) of the final product depends upon characteristics of the components to be assembled, which are not constant from component to component. We analyze the tradeoff between the increase in the potential value of products gained by putting off the mating of components exhibiting various characteristic types, and the inventory costs caused by this delay in mating. We formulate this dynamic type mating problem as a Markov Decision Process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy for special cases. We then present a heuristic policy for a more general case and compare its performance against the optimal policy. Computational results indicate that the heuristic is effective for a wide variety of cases.

## 3. Incomplete Information, Task Assignment, and Managerial Control Systems
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
A firm typically assigns multiple tasks it must perform to either internal employees or outside vendors. This paper demonstrates the need to integrate a task assignment decision with the design of a managerial control system as each affects the other. An internal employee is distinguished from an outside supplier on four different informational dimensions: (i) at the time of contracting, the outside supplier has less information about the task environment more often than the internal employee; (ii) the principal observes the employee's information set more frequently than that of the supplier; (iii) the principal can exercise a greater control over information flow to the internal employee than to the outside supplier; and (iv) the principal may share the details of the outside supplier's contract with the internal employee but not vice versa. Under each of these four distinguishing dimensions, the principal is shown to outsource the upstream task and assign the downstream task to the internal employee more often than vice versa. Further, under the last two dimensions of the firm's boundary, the principal can eliminate inefficiencies arising from the agents' contracting with incomplete information by assigning the downstream task to the employee and not providing predecision information to him while assigning the upstream task to the supplier.

## 4. Measuring Efficiencies and Returns to Scale of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone in Production and Cost Analyses
### Author(s):
- Toshiyuki Sueyoshi
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
This article provides a theoretical framework related to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in which an analytical relationship among eight different efficiency concepts is defined and explored in terms of production and cost analyses. This article extends the theoretical basis into the measurement of Scale Economies (SE) and Returns to Scale (RTS). A unique feature of the SE/RTS measurement is that the proposed approach is based upon the measurement regarding not only production activity but also cost performance. As an important case study, this article applies the DEA-based approach to measure the eight efficiency concepts and SE/RTS of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT). This study finds that NTT has maintained high SE and increasing RTS in the operations of 39 annual periods from 1953 through 1992.

## 5. Effects of the User Participation Process and Task Meaningfulness on Key Information System Outcomes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
In this study, 144 professional accounting data entry clerks took part in a fully randomized field experiment using a 4 (mode of participation)  2 (task meaningfulness) design. Participants were full-time, mandatory users of payroll applications. The nature of the experiment engaged these users in hands-on activity (Hartwick and Barki [Hartwick, J., H. Barki. 1994. Explaining the role of user participation in information system use. Management Sci.40 440465.]) regarding the development of a payroll input screen. User mode of participation was manipulated by varying the extent of decision input used to execute hands-on activity in accordance with procedural justice theory. Perceptions of decision control, procedural justice, and outcome satisfaction, as well as objective levels of task performance escalated with corresponding increases in decision input. Task meaningfulness was manipulated by creating either high or low expectations of using the payroll input screen in the near future. As the development task became more meaningful, procedural justice, decision control, task commitment, and task performance responses also increased. An underlying theoretical model of treatment effects was tested using path analysis which supported the control-oriented theory of procedural justice. The strong attitudinal and behavioral results observed in this experiment enhance understanding of the user participation and involvement model proposed by Hartwick and Barki (Hartwick, J., H. Barki. 1994. Explaining the role of user participation in information system use. Management Sci.40 440465.) by incorporating process considerations from procedural justice theory into their framework. Implications of this research are discussed.

## 6. An Empirical Study on Intertemporal Decision Making Under Risk
### Author(s):
- Martin Ahlbrecht
- Martin Weber
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
This study compares time preference in the cases of certainty and risk. We analyze both matching and choice behavior. We find that violations of the stationarity axiom are restricted to matching behavior, both for certainty and risk. We also compare the discounting of certain and risky outcomes as well as the discounting of gains and losses. In matching tasks, certain outcomes are discounted more than risky ones. We could not confirm these results in a choice task. Gains and losses are not found to be discounted at different rates.

## 7. Maximizing the Effectiveness of a Preventive Maintenance System: An Adaptive Modeling Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
The dynamic nature of an operating environment, such as machine utilization and breakdown frequency results in changing preventive maintenance (PM) needs for manufacturing equipment. In this paper, we present an approach to generate an adaptive PM schedule which maximizes the net savings from PM subject to workforce constraints. The approach consists of two components: (a) task prioritization based on a multi-logit regression model for each type of PM task, and (b) task rescheduling based on a binary integer programming (BIP) model with constraints on single-skilled and multi-skilled workforce availability. The task prioritization component develops a multi-logit regression for machine failure probability associated with each type of PM task at the beginning of the year, using historical data on machine utilization, PM, and machine breakdowns. At the start of each PM time-bucket (e.g., a month), we use the updated machine failure probability for each candidate PM task to compute its current contribution to net PM savings, which indicates its current priority. The task rescheduling BIP model incorporates the priorities in selecting tasks for the current bucket to maximize PM effectiveness subject to workforce availability, yielding an adaptive and effective PM schedule for each time-bucket of the master PM schedule. We examine the effect of using multi-skilled workforce on the overall PM effectiveness, and also provide an illustration from a newspaper publishing environment to explain the use of the approach. We have developed four heuristic algorithms to yield good solutions to large scale versions of this scheduling problem. The heuristics perform extremely well, and the best heuristic solution is within 1.4% of optimality on an average.

## 8. Daily Aircraft Routing and Scheduling

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider the daily aircraft routing and scheduling problem (DARSP). It consists of determining daily schedules which maximize the anticipated profits derived from the aircraft of a heterogeneous fleet. This fleet must cover a set of operational flight legs with known departure time windows, durations and profits according to the aircraft type. We present two models for this problem: a Set Partitioning type formulation and a time constrained multicommodity network flow formulation. We describe the network structure of the subproblem when a column generation technique is applied to solve the linear relaxation of the first model and when a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach is used to solve the linear relaxation of the second model. The linear relaxation of the first model provides upper bounds. Integer solutions to the overall problem are derived through branch-and-bound. By exploiting the equivalence between the two formulations, we propose various optimal branching strategies compatible with the column generation technique. Finally we report computational results obtained on data provided by two different airlines. These results show that significant profit improvement can be generated by solving the DARSP using our approach and that this can be obtained in a reasonable amount of CPU time.

## 9. The Influence Prism in SMEs: The Power of CEOs' Perceptions on Technology Policy and Its Organizational Impacts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
The research proposes a model, which relates the following variables: (a) the CEO's perceptions of the environment, (b) the strategic business orientation, scanning, and structural characteristics, (c) technology policy, (d) realized innovative efforts of the firm, and (e) measures of firm performance. The empirical data from small manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) that share a common economic and industrial environment show that CEOs' perceptions of external environmentand not objective measuresare key significant issues with respect to technology policy formulation and enactment in SMEs and its subsequent organizational impacts. In particular, perceived environmental hostility and dynamism are shown to have specific and differing moderating roles on the form and strength of the relationships between technology policy and its determinants and between technology policy and realized innovative efforts. Furthermore, a more aggressive technology policy leads to greater realized innovative efforts, which in turn are positively related to export performance and, to a lesser extent, to financial performance.

## 10. Forecasting a Cumulative Variable Using Its Partially Accumulated Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
Several forecasting algorithms have been proposed to forecast a cumulative variable using its partially accumulated data. Some particular cases of this problem are known in the literature as the style goods inventory problem or as forecasting shipments using firm orders-to-date, among other names. Here we summarize some of the most popular techniques and propose a statistical approach to discriminate among them in an objective (data-based) way. Our basic idea is to use statistical models to produce minimum mean square error forecasts and let the data lead us to select an appropriate model to represent their behavior. We apply our proposal to some published data showing total accumulated values with constant level and then to two actual sets of data pertaining to the Mexican economy, showing a nonconstant level. The forecasting performance of the statistical models was evaluated by comparing their results against those obtained with algorithmic solutions. In general the models produced better forecasts for all lead times, as indicated by the most common measures of forecasting accuracy and precision.

## 11. The Multi-Item Setup-Reduction Investment-Allocation Problem with Continuous Investment-Cost Functions
### Author(s):
- John P. Leschke
- Elliott N. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1997
### Abstract:
In this note, we analyze investment priorities for setup-reduction programs in a multi-product system. We provide an objective function transformation for the model developed by Porteus (Porteus, E. L. 1985. Investing in reduced setups in the EOQ model. Management Sci.31(8, August) 9981010.) that permits the use of marginal analysis in both the single- and multiple-item problems. For the multiple-item problem, we show that managers should not reduce the setup for each product to its optimum in sequential order. This is in contrast to recommendations found in the existing literature.
