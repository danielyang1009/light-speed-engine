### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a problem of joint coordination between a firm's manufacturing and supply departments. The manufacturing department is responsible for meeting random demand of a product with a short life cycle. The supply department's responsibility is to provide the sufficient amount of raw materials so that the required production level can be achieved. When coordination prevails, both departments' decisions are jointly made; otherwise, decisions are made independently without an exchange of information. If the random demand exceeds the amount produced, a second production run can be expedited at a substantially higher cost. Our analysis yields insightful results to such a coordination problem between the two departments. We provide conditions under which it is desirable to coordinate, resulting in a significant increase in expected profit. If coordination is optimal, then the supply department would purchase additional reserved material for the second run. Under this scenario, we analyze the effects of joint coordination on the expected profit. We also find explicit conditions for which joint coordination is not beneficial, i.e., the supply department should only order sufficient material to meet the first production run requirements. We provide a detailed set of numerical examples and generate response surfaces indicating the desirability of coordination for different pairs of parameter combinations.

## 2. The Assimilation of Software Process Innovations: An Organizational Learning Perspective

### Abstract:
The burden of organizational learning surrounding software process innovations (SPIs)and complex organizational technologies in generalcreates a knowledge barrier that inhibits diffusion. Attewell (Attewell, P. 1992. Technology diffusion and organizational learning the case of business computing. Organ. Sci.3(1) 119.) has suggested that many organizations will defer adoption until knowledge barriers have been sufficiently lowered; however, this leaves open the question of which organizations should be more likely to innovate, even in face of high knowledge barriers. It is proposed here that organizations will innovate in the presence of knowledge barriers when the burden of organizational learning is effectively lower, either because much of the required know-how already exists within the organization, or because such knowledge can be acquired more easily or more economically. Specifically, it is hypothesized that organizations will have a greater propensity to initiate and sustain the assimilation of SPIs when they have a greater scale of activities over which learning costs can be spread (learning-related scale), more extensive existing knowledge related to the focal innovation (related knowledge), and a greater diversity of technical knowledge and activities (diversity). An empirical study using data on the assimilation of object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs) by 608 information technology organizations strongly confirmed the importance of the three hypothesized factors in explaining the assimilation of OOPLs.

## 3. Modeling the Domestic Distribution Network for Illicit Drugs
### Author(s):
- Jonathan P. Caulkins
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
This paper presents a simple economic model of a drug dealer's decision about how many customers to supply. The model relates the number of customers (i.e., the branching factor of the distribution network) to a quantity discount factor describing the extent to which prices are marked up from one distribution level to the next and the ratio of selling costs to product costs. Solving the model allows one to infer characteristics of the domestic distribution network from more readily observable characteristics of the markets and, thereby, to gain insight into how drug control interventions might work.

## 4. Production Quotas as Bounds on Interplant JIT Contracts
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We consider the situation of a supplier plant whose customer plants desire just-in-time (JIT) deliveries. Randomness in both the production and demand processes make satisfying every demand that might occur in true JIT fashion impossible. Therefore, supplier plants typically negotiate bounds on JIT contracts with their customers. In this paper, we focus on the use of quotas or target inventory levels as a mechanism for establishing such bounds. That is, the supplier firm is responsible for meeting periodic demands up to the quota, but not beyond. In this paper, we consider the problem of setting an appropriate quota from the perspective of the supplier plant and interpret our results in the context of the negotiation process between the supplier and its customers. Under the assumption that safety capacity (i.e., overtime or a vendoring option) is available, we develop two models that address this problem. The first model assumes that quota shortfalls cannot be carried over to the next regular time production period and are made up with overtime/vendoring, which incurs fixed plus variable costs. The second model assumes that shortages can be backlogged to the next regular time production period at a cost. We use numerical examples to demonstrate how the models we developed were used by a clutch supplier to a large auto manufacturer to negotiate its JIT contracts.

## 5. Effects of Color as an Executional Cue in Advertising: They're in the Shade
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
In designing print ads, one of the decisions the advertiser must make is which color(s) to use as executional cues in the ad. Typically, color decisions are based on intuition and anecdotal evidence. To provide guidelines for these decisions, this research proposes and tests a conceptual framework linking the hue, chroma, and value of the color(s) in an ad to consumers' feelings and attitudes. In an experimental study, the three dimensions of color used in an ad are manipulated using a between-subjects design. The results support the hypotheses that ads containing colors with a higher level of value lead to greater liking for the ad, and this effect is mediated by the greater feelings of relaxation elicited by the higher value color. Feelings play an equally important role in the effect of chroma. Consistent with the hypotheses, higher levels of chroma elicit greater feelings of excitement, which in turn increase ad likeability. A follow-up study found that although managers often select higher value and higher chroma colors, in a large number of cases they do not. The findings of both studies are integrated in our discussion of the importance of value and chroma in increasing the range of options available to a manager faced with the selection of colors in an ad.

## 6. Advertising Fee in Business-Format Franchising
### Author(s):
- Preyas S. Desai
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
Most franchisors charge an advertising fee in addition to the better known royalty and franchise fee. We study the role of the advertising fee in improving channel coordination. We begin our analysis with a simple case of one franchisor dealing with two identical franchisees and find that the advertising fee allows the franchisor to commit to a specific level of advertising spending at the time of contract acceptance. We also find that the lump-sum advertising fee is better than the sales-based advertising fee. These results are intriguing because most franchisors use the sales-based advertising fee. We show that when franchisees' markets differ in how advertising affects sales, the franchisor may prefer the sales-based advertising fee. There are two reasons for the higher profitability of the sales-based advertising fee. First, the sales-based advertising fee conditions the franchisor's advertising decision on the franchisees' price and service decisions, and induces them to make better price and service decisions. The second reason is that with heterogeneous franchisees, using the sales-based advertising fee does not increase the total sales-based component in the fee structure. These results also hold when the franchisor pledges to contribute a matching fraction of the advertising fee to the advertising fund.

## 7. A Methodology for Evaluating Military Systems in a Counterproliferation Role
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
This paper illustrates a methodology to evaluate how dissimilar military systems support the accomplishment of the United States' counterproliferation objectives. The key questions in evaluating counterproliferation systems are identified. By using decision analysis, an influence diagram model is developed that represents military activities in the counterproliferation process. A value model is developed that enables systems to be evaluated against common criteria. An analysis of intelligence, defensive, and offensive counterproliferation systems suggests that intelligence system improvements may provide the greatest potential to meet the United States' counterproliferation objectives. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine which factors in the model are most important. To demonstrate the model, nine systems from the Air Force Vulcan's Forge 1995 wargame are evaluated. This paper illustrates the value of decision analysis, and influence diagrams in particular, by involving decision makers and subject matter experts in structuring complex problems for analysis.

## 8. Revised-Modified Penalties for Fixed Charge Transportation Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
Conditional penalties are used to obtain lower bounds to subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure that can be tighter than the LP relaxation of the subproblems. For the fixed charge transportation problem (FCTP), branch-and-bound algorithms have been implemented using conditional penalties proposed by Driebeek (Driebeek, N. 1966. An algorithm for the solution of mixed integer programming problems. Management Sci.12 576587.), Cabot and Erenguc (Cabot, A. V., S. S. Erenguc. 1984. Some branch-and-bound procedures for fixed-cost transportation problems. Naval Res. Logistics31 145154.), and Palekar et al. (Palekar, V. S., M. H. Karwan, S. Zionts. 1990. A branch-and-bound method for the fixed charge transportation problem. Management Sci.36 10921105.). The last conditional penalties are referred to as the modified penalties. In this paper, we show that the modified penalties are not valid conditional penalties. In fact, in nearly a quarter of the test problems examined, the modified penalties prevented the branch-and-bound algorithm from properly identifying the optimal solution to the FCTP. A simple change, which corrects a subcase in the penalty calculation, restores the validity of the modified penalties while retaining their efficiency. Computational tests indicate that the revised-modified penalties continue to dominate the Driebeek and the Cabot and Erenguc penalties.

## 9. Estimation Risk in Portfolio Selection: The Mean Variance Model Versus the Mean Absolute Deviation Model
### Author(s):
- Yusif Simaan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
Konno and Yamazaki (Konno, H., K. Yamazaki. 1992. Mean-absolute deviation portfolio optimization model and its applications to Tokyo stock market. Management Sci.39 519531.) propose the mean absolute deviation (MAD) model as an alternative to the mean variance (MV) model. They claim it retains all the positive features of the MV model, saves the investor computing time, and does not require the covariance matrix. This paper shows that ignoring the covariance matrix results in greater estimation risk that outweighs the benefits. In both models, estimation error is more severe in small samples (small observations relative to the number of assets) and for investors with high risk tolerance. The MV model's lower estimation risk is most striking in small samples and for investors with a low risk tolerance.

### Author(s):
- S. Viswanathan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
This note deals with the joint replenishment problem with stochastic demands. A new class of policies called P(s, S) policy is proposed for this problem. The proposed policy uses independent, periodic review (s, S) policies for each item. Results on test problems show that the proposed policy is superior to other classes of policies for the problem.

## 11. Comments on Fortune Favors the Prepared Firm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
A recent paper in Management Science titled Fortune Favors the Prepared Firm (Cohen and Levinthal [Cohen, W. M., D. A. Levinthal. 1994. Fortune favors the prepared firm. Management Sci.40(2) 227251.]) is a pioneering work insofar as it introduces the concept of a firm's absorptive capacitythe ability to evaluate, assimilate, and exploit extramural technological developments. We appreciate the paper's extensive qualitative discussion of the nature and role of absorptive capacity. We also commend the authors' idea of constructing a mathematical model to analyze a rational firm's incentives for an investment in absorptive capacity. However, we find that the authors' model overlooks one key element of a firm's absorptive capacity, namely, the firm's ability to defend itself against the threat of an external technology. In the absence of that element, the authors' model may be able to explain a firm's incentives for an innovation rather than incentives for the development of an absorptive capacity. We also identify several internal inconsistencies in the authors' mathematical model. For example, the assumed profit maximization function seems inconsistent with the assumed degree of sophistication of the firm's probability assessment behavior. We believe that the inconsistencies and shortcomings noted here raise serious questions about the validity of the authors' findings. However, we hope that this note does not detract from the pioneering nature of the authors' work, but instead increases its value by stimulating further work on the important topic of absorptive capacity.

## 12. Reply to Comments on Fortune Favors the Prepared Firm
### Author(s):
- Wesley M. Cohen
- Daniel A. Levinthal
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1997
### Abstract:
Joglekar, Bohl, and Hamburg (JBH) make two basic sets of criticisms of our paper (Cohen and Levinthal [Cohen, W. M., D. A. Levinthal. 1994. Fortune favors the prepared firm. Management Sci.40 227251.]) in their comment. First, they object to two key elements of the model structure: the relevance of the monopoly analysis and the appropriateness of modeling competition via an entry model. Second, JBH express concern over the manner in which we have modeled the updating process. With regard to the basic model structure, we argue that the initial monopoly analysis allows us to capture some important notions regarding the path dependent nature of investment in technical capabilities. Further, the analysis of competition by an entry model does not presume that an established firm takes the initiative which is one of JBH's key objections. The structure merely implies that some firm, possibly a start-up enterprise, moves first. With regard to the concerns over the modeling of updating, we acknowledge that our notation could have been clearer in some instances but that does not negate the correctness of the analysis. Furthermore, JBH's recommendations regarding the updating process have the same qualitative properties as our own specification. Indeed, at no point in their critique do JBH ever indicate how their proposed specification would change the results of our analysis.
