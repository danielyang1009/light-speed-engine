### Abstract:
Customer service has assumed strategic importance in most manufacturing environments. Corporate reputations often depend on how reliably promised lead times are met. A goal of filling orders within a service window of T time units is often encountered in practice. This goal ignores the differences among types of units, treating all customers as equally important. Keeping finished goods inventory of all items is only one, and often not the best, way to achieve this objective. High-demand items naturally have safety stock assigned to them, but in many organizations there are so many very-low-demand items that keeping any stock in these items is prohibitively expensive. Customer service can be maintained for these low-demand items by giving them higher production priority when a demand occurs. In this paper, stochastic analysis and simulation are employed to test the merit of this idea. Changes in management structure to allow this type of system are discussed.

## 2. Inspection for Circuit Board Assembly

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
Several stages of tests are typically performed in circuit board assembly, and each test consists of one or more noisy measurements. We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the allocation of inspection and the testing policy in a system with a predefined inspection configuration; that is, at which stages should a board be inspected, and at these stages, whether to accept or reject a board based on noisy test measurements. The objective is to minimize the expected costs for testing, repair, and defective items shipped to customers. We analyze the problem and document an application of the model to an industrial facility. Since we were unable to gather all the necessary data, the model was applied in a limited and piecemeal fashion. Nevertheless, the proposed policy significantly improves upon the facility's historical policy.

## 3. Opportunities for Improved Statistical Process Control
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
Our Bayesian dynamic programming model builds on existing models to account for inspection delay, choice of keeping production going during inspection and/or restoration, and lot sizing. We focus on describing how dynamic statistical process control (DSPC) rules can improve on traditional, static ones. We explore numerical examples and identify nine opportunities for improvement. Some of these ideas are well known and strongly supported in the literature. Other ideas may be less well understood. Our list includes the following: Cancel some of the inspections called for by an (economically) optimal static rule when starting in control (such as at the beginning of a production run and following a restoration). Inspect more frequently than called for by an optimal static rule once inspections begin, and inspect even more frequently than that when negative evidence is accumulated. Utilize evidence from previous inspections to justify either restoration or another inspection. Cancel inspections and hesitate to restore the process at the end of a production run. Consider using scheduled restoration, in which restoration is carried out regardless of the results of any inspections. Implementation, limitations, and extensions are addressed.

## 4. Partial Deductive Closure: Logical Simulation and Management Science
### Author(s):

- Michael Masuch
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
This research is part of a larger effort to build machine-based tools for developing scientific theories. In analogy with the research process in empirical research, we describe a logical cycle of theory development: (1) starting with an informal version of a theory, (2) then moving to its formal representation, (3) applying formal logic to investigate this representation, and (4) using the results as feedback for the update/revision of the original theory. A central aspect of the logical cycle is the detection of the (hidden) implications of a theory (called partial deductive closure). In this paper, we present an algorithm that performs the partial deductive closure for a relevant class of theorems, while filtering out trivial results. The algorithm is applied to an important organization theory, Organizational Ecology, and is shown to generate new theorems of interest.

## 5. The Impact of Just-in-Time Manufacturing and Its Infrastructure on Manufacturing Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
We consider Just-in-Time (JIT) to be an overall organizational phenomenon. Accordingly, we developed and tested a model that includes both JIT practices and the infrastructure practices hypothesized to provide an environment in which JIT practices perform more effectively. Canonical correlation analysis was used to test five hypotheses. The results indicated that: (1) there was not a significant relationship between the use of JIT practices, alone, and manufacturing performance, (2) there was a very strong relationship between JIT practices and infrastructure practices; (3) the combination of JIT management and infrastructure practice was related to manufacturing performance; (4) infrastructure, by itself, is sufficient to explain manufacturing performance; and (5) manufacturing performance was related to competitive advantage. These findings provide support for the notion that JIT is an overall organizational phenomenon, rather than limited to strictly shop floor practices, and that at least part of its effect on manufacturing performance may be through providing a set of improvement targets and discipline for the entire organization. In addition, the analysis highlights the areas of infrastructure practice most relevant for future research.

## 6. Does Implementing an Effective TQM Program Actually Improve Operating Performance? Empirical Evidence from Firms That Have Won Quality Awards
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
This study explores the hypotheses that implementing effective total quality management (TQM) programs improves the operating performance of firms. The winning of quality awards is used as a proxy for the effective implementation of TQM programs. Changes in various performance measures for a test sample of quality-award winners are compared against a sample of control firms. Our statistical tests provide strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards outperform the control firms on operating income-based measures. Over a 10-year period, from 6 years before to 3 years after the year of winning the first quality award, the mean (median) change in the operating income for the test sample is 107% (48%) higher than that of the control sample. There is reasonably strong evidence that firms that have won quality awards do better on sales growth than the control firms. Over the 10-year period, the mean (median) change in sales for the test sample is 64% (24%) higher than that of the control sample. We also find weak evidence that firms in our test sample are more successful in controlling costs when compared with the firms in the control sample. In addition, the results indicate that firms in our test sample increased their capital expenditures more than the control sample over the time period prior to winning quality awards. Compared with the control sample, the test sample shows higher growth in both employment and total assets.

## 7. Withdrawal of Team Autonomy During Concurrent Engineering
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
Team autonomy is an essential characteristic of cross-functional teams engaged in concurrent engineering. At the same time it is a characteristic that North American firms have considerable difficulty in successfully implementing. Delegating a good deal of decision making to teams is often counteracted by processes that during a new product program withdraw some of a team's autonomy or discretion. Data from 53 cross-functional product development teams in 14 firms indicated that withdrawing autonomy is negatively correlated with both task and process aspects of team performance. The determinants of withdrawing discretion include lack of a shared understanding of the development process, environmental change, and lack of managerial buy-in to team autonomy. Consequently, successful implementation of team autonomy, through mitigating withdrawal of discretion, requires a clear well-communicated model of the development process, a freezing of design revisions, and policies that encourage managers to support the team rather than interfere in its decision making.

## 8. Large-Sample Results for Batch Means

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
In analyzing the output process generated by a steady-state simulation, we often seek to estimate the expected value of the output. The sample mean based on a finite sample of size n is usually the estimator of choice for the steady-state mean; and a measure of the sample mean's precision is the variance parameter, i.e., the limiting value of the sample size multiplied by the variance of the sample mean as n becomes large. This paper establishes asymptotic properties of the conventional batch-means (BM) estimator of the variance parameter as both the batch size and the number of batches become large. In particular, we show that the BM variance estimator is asymptotically unbiased and convergent in mean square. We also provide asymptotic expressions for the variance of the BM variance estimator. Exact and empirical examples illustrate our findings.

## 9. Control of a Stochastic Production System with Estimated Parameters
### Author(s):

- Christopher S. Tang
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
For an uncertain production system, the rule that controls the flow of material relies on parameters, such as the yield rates and the demand rate. These parameters are estimates, and they are usually inaccurate. In this paper, we analyze a type of pull rule called a proportional restoration rule. We show that these rules are stable; they do not lead to erratic behavior even when the estimation error is significant. We also show that these rules localize the effect of mis-estimates; e.g., underestimating the demand rate lowers the level of finished goods inventory, but has scant effect within the line. We show that these rules exhibit other desirable attributesthat they are efficient, that they are easy to interpret, and that they recover from disruptions quickly.

## 10. Planning Information TechnologyKnowledge Worker Systems
### Author(s):
- Cheryl Gaimon
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1997
### Abstract:
A model is introduced to examine the long-term planning associated with the purchase and implementation of information technologies (IT) that indirectly contribute to output through enhancement of an organization's knowledge workers. For example, architectural firms in the service industry and manufacturers developing new or modified products invest in computer-aided design systems (CAD) to increase the volume of output generated by the engineering specialist.
