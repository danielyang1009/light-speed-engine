### Abstract:
The global markets of today offer to the style goods producer more selling opportunities and pose new challenges in production planning and coordination. From a production management standpoint the opportunity to exploit the difference in timing of the selling season of geographically dispersed markets for style goods is important for improving the firms profitability. In this paper we examine the above issue with an insightful model of a producer of style goods selling the goods to two markets (a primary and a secondary market) with nonoverlapping selling seasons. We refer to this problem as the global newsvendor problem. For the above two market stochastic inventory systems we first develop optimal centralized control policies. Then we demonstrate the suboptimality of decentralized production control policies, with the production centers at each market treated as independent profit centers and a constant transfer price being used to coordinate their production. We propose as an effective alternative a decentralized production control structure with a nonlinear pricing scheme for production coordination among centers administered through an intermediate organizational unit. In our modeling, we explicitly consider the effects of exchange rate uncertainty on the production planning decisions.

## 2. Generalising Interest Rate Duration with Directional Derivatives: Direction X and Applications
### Author(s):
- Roger J. Bowden
### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
Conventional (or Fisher-Weil) duration is an ordinary derivative that measures the response of portfolio value to marginal parallel shifts in the term structure, while other proposed measures are generally specific to particular interest rate processes. In this paper, we show that portfolio responses to arbitrary shifts in the term structure may be handled by the use of Frchet or directional derivatives, presenting a simple algorithm for the directional derivative of a fixed interest portfolio, viewed as a set of cash flows. For a given portfolio, one can locate the most sensitive areas along the term structure by computing a function or profile (Direction X) that gives the term structure movement to which the portfolio is most exposed. Immunisation techniques can be based on choosing ancillary assets that ensure that the portfolio directional derivative is zero, or as close to zero as possible; this generalises approaches based on factor models of the term structure. The analysis is applied to both continuous and discrete time.

### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
Differences in players' skill are important determinants of relative player success in most real games such as poker, chess, basketball, business, and politics. Yet conventional game theory has concentrated primarily on games with no skill differences among players. This paper uses a simplified version of stud poker to better understand the concept of differential player skill in games. Players with very different strategies for playing this game are modeled algorithmically and pitted against one another in simulation tournaments.

## 4. Domestic Competitive Position and Export Strategy of Japanese Manufacturing Firms: 19711985
### Author(s):
- Kiyohiko Ito
### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes Japanese manufacturing firms' export behavior and their performance. In a slow growth era, leading firms' and minor firms' export ratio tended to be less than that of follower (medium market share) firms in the same industry; there appears to be an inverted-U shape between export ratio and relative size of firms. An affiliation with a large industrial group has no positive relationship with export ratio, while other firm-specific factors do not show consistent relationships with it in the years 1971 to 1985. Exports and firm performance do not have a positive relationship. Competitive environment in the domestic market is related to the export strategy of Japanese firms.

## 5. Metagraphs in Hierarchical Modeling

- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
When using a decision support system (DSS) containing a large model base, a user has to decide which specific models are relevant for any particular task. When the model base is large and diverse, this task can be quite difficult. Furthermore, the number and variety of models available can be confusing. One way to simplify the user's interaction with the DSS, and facilitate more effective use of the system, is through the use of views of the model base. A view is an abstraction of a model base that limits attention to relationships between certain variables, and its purpose is to guide the development of DSS software that executes lower-level models in response to higher-level requests for information or analysis. Single views may be of use to individual decision makers who wish to abstract information from a model base, and multiple views may be of use to collections of decision makers who are using a model base to integrate their analyses to make a collective decision. In this paper, we show how representation of models using a graph theoretic structure called a metagraph can facilitate the construction and maintenance of model base views. In particular, we show how useful views can be constructed using a projection operation on a metagraph, and also present conditions under which views can be combined. The concepts developed in the paper are illustrated using an example from life cycle costing.

## 6. Bi-Matching: A New Preference Assessment Method to Reduce Compatibility Effects
### Author(s):
- Philippe Delqui
### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
Preference models and utility functions are often assessed by eliciting value trade-offs among attributes. Prior research has shown that trade-off judgments can be biased in systematic ways: for example, the attribute which is used as response receives more relative subjective weight, i.e. the so-called scale compatibility effects (Tversky et al. [Tversky, A., S. Sattath, P. Slovic. 1988. Contingent weighting in judgment and choice. Psych. Rev.95 371384.]). This paper proposes a new procedure to elicit value trade-offs called bidimensional matching, or bi-matching, designed to alleviate this effect. Bi-matching differs from traditional trade-off judgments, in that both attributes are adjusted simultaneously to reach indifference judgments. Bi-matching is compared with simple matching and choice in four experimental studies, to measure preferences for lotteries and riskless multiattribute alternatives. The main results are: (1) bi-matching produces trade-offs intermediate between those derived from matching on the more important attribute and matching on the less important attribute, although closer to the former; (2) the trade-offs derived from choice reflect more relative weight on the more important dimension than those from bi-matching; (3) bi-matching appears to reduce response error compared to standard matching. These results are generally consistent with theoretical predictions. We discuss the normative question of which preference assessment method is preferable. The current results as a whole and the built-in features of the bi-matching procedure already position this elicitation method as a worthwhile alternative to traditional methods for helping decision-makers introspect and construct their value trade-offs.

## 7. Middle Management Downsizing: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Information Technology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
Nearly all Fortune 1000 firms claim to have downsized since the early eighties, and it is argued that information technology (IT) is responsible for this massive downsizing. However, earlier research has indicated that IT increases middle management. Even though the impact of IT on the middle management workforce has been studied for the last thirty years, research has failed to clearly explain this phenomenon. Quite the opposite, research has fueled controversy and has provided inconsistent findings. This article addresses the state of inconsistent findings across multiple studies by examining the impact of information technology on the number of middle managers using two additional variables: the degree of centralization of organizational decision authority and the degree of centralization of computing decision authority. One hundred and fifty-five city governments were surveyed. Information technology was found to be both positively and negatively associated with the size of the middle management workforce. The impact of information technology was fundamentally determined by who controlled computing decisions and what interests were being served, and by the roles of middle managers. Information technology was associated with a decrease in the size of the middle management workforce in organizations with centralized decision authority and with an increase in the number of middle managers in organizations where decision authority was decentralized.

## 8. Performance in Principal-Agent Dyads: The Causes and Consequences of Perceived Asymmetry of Commitment to the Relationship
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
We focus on the principal-agent relationship in a distribution channel. In a services context (insurance), we examine how two facets of performance, from the point of view of both the principal and the agent, are influenced by the perceiver's belief that it is more committed to the relationship than is the other party. Using primary data from 255 insurance agent-insurance provider dyads, we show that each side's assessment of how much it benefits from the dyad is related in a potentially dysfunctional manner to its perception of asymmetric commitment. Perceivers rate their performance outcomes from the dyad (i.e., harmony and profit) highest when they believe they are less committed than their counterpart. Conversely, they rate their own performance outcomes lowest when they believe they are more committed than the other party. We explain this finding in terms of suspected opportunism and offer a partial test of this explanation compared with explanations from theories of equity and power/dependence. Further, we demonstrate that each party's perception of asymmetric commitment partially reflects actual asymmetry, as measured by confidential data collected from both sides. Perceived asymmetric commitment is also shown to be related to levels of communication and dependence in the dyad. Managerial implications for reducing perceived asymmetric commitment and improving the performance outcomes of each dyad member are discussed.

## 9. Optimal Operating Policies in the Presence of Exchange Rate Variability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
We study the structure of the optimal policies for a firm operating plants in different countries. The relative costs of production between the plants are assumed to vary over time due to economic and political factors such as exchange rates, inflation, taxes, and tariffs. Based on the costs, the firm can alter the quantity produced in each plant. We determine the structure of the optimal policies for deciding when and by how much to alter the production quantities. When the switch-over costs are linear or step functions, regardless of whether the variable production costs are concave or piece-wise linear convex, and regardless of whether the firm is supplying one or more markets, the optimal policy is always a barrier policy. The optimal barriers can be determined by using linear programming techniques, and the optimal costs can be computed by solving a system of linear equations. When the number of optimal barriers is two, the optimal expected costs and the condition that determines the optimal barriers are explicitly derived.

## 10. Use of Convex Cones in Interactive Multiple Objective Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1997
### Abstract:
One approach for solving decision problems involving multiple objectives is interactive optimization. Methods based on this approach assess the decision makers preference structure interactively, typically based on pairwise comparisons and tradeoffs, and guide the search process toward identifying improved solutions. A desirable feature of such approaches, that is based on minimizing the preference information requirements, is fast convergence. Toward this end, the use of convex cones as a preference structure representation has been proposed in the literature. In this work, new theory is developed that aids in further reducing preference information requirements and improving convergence. New cones termed p cones are developed. The efficiencies of solution alternatives are evaluated with respect to the p cones, and these are termed p cone efficiencies. Acceleration and Early Termination procedures that are based on these efficiencies are proposed. The procedures are presented within a solution framework for solving Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) problems along with computational results.
