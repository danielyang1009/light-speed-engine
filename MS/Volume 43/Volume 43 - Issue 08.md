### Abstract:
We develop an interactive method for multiple objective linear programming based on aspiration levels of a decision maker. The method assumes an unknown pseudoconcave preference structure of a decision maker throughout the decision process, and the decision maker's ability to select a preferred solution from p + 1 alternatives, where p is the number of objectives. In addition to presenting the supporting theory and algorithm, we perform a comparative study using a fictitious decision maker, comparing our approach to those of Steuer and Choo (Steuer, R. E., E. Choo. 1983. An interactive weighted Tchebycheff procedure for multiple objective programming. Math. Prog.26 326344.) and Reeves and Franz (Reeves, G. R., L. Franz. 1985. A simplified interactive multiple objective linear programming procedure. Comp. & Oper. Res.12 589601.). All three methods are interactive. During an iteration, each method presents several solution alternatives to the decision maker simultaneously. Our approach utilizes a Tchebycheff function that facilitates attainment of an optimum at a nonextreme point solution. The statistics collected in the comparative study provide insights into the nature of the algorithms and the behavior of the solution techniques with different categories of problem structure and different underlying utility functions.

## 2. Probabilistic Analysis of a Combined Aggregation and Math Programming Heuristic for a General Class of Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
We propose and analyze a heuristic that uses region partitioning and an aggregation scheme for customer attributes (load size, time windows, etc.) to create a finite number of customer types. A math program is solved based on these aggregated customer types to generate a feasible solution to the original problem. The problem class we address is quite general and defined by a number of general consistency properties. Problems in this class include VRPs with general distance norms, capacitated problems, time window VRPs, pick-up and delivery problems, combined inventory control and routing problems and arc routing.

## 3. Process Range in Manufacturing: An Empirical Study of Flexibility
### Author(s):
- David M. Upton
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
This paper examines the relationship between one form of manufacturing flexibilityprocess rangeand structure, infrastructure, and managerial policy at the plant level. The paper provides evidence of the strength of the links between manufacturing flexibility and such factors as scale, technology vintage, computer integration, and workforce management. Data from 54 plants in the fine-paper industry are presented, and a model of the determinants of short-term flexibility is developed. The plants examined differed by a factor of 20 in their ability to accommodate large process variation. The evidence suggests that flexibility is strongly negatively related to scale and degree of computer integration, yet positively related to newer vintages of mechanical technology and workforce experience. Some results differ significantly from the prevailing view of the industry, in particular, that newer plants are less flexible. The paper shows that newer machine technology is more flexible once other factors are controlled for. In the longer term, the results show that management has a significant impact on the improvement of flexibility in operations, regardless of the technology and infrastructure in place. Plant network managers' views of flexibility are important. The data suggest that inflexible plants may be inflexible partly as a result of their being considered inflexible by network managers, and never being assigned the product range needed to improve the capability.

## 4. Inventory Rationing in a Make-to-Stock Production System with Several Demand Classes and Lost Sales
### Author(s):
- Albert Y. Ha
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
This paper considers the stock rationing problem of a single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. For the case of Poisson demands and exponential production times, we show that the optimal policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone stock rationing levels. For each demand class, there exists a stock rationing level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher priority demands. A simple queueing model is analyzed to compute the operating cost of a rationing policy. In a numerical study, we compare the optimal rationing policy with a first-come first-served policy to investigate the benefit of stock rationing under different operating conditions of the system.

## 5. A Predictive Model of Sequential Iteration in Engineering Design
### Author(s):
- Robert P. Smith
- Steven D. Eppinger
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model describing sequential iteration, one of the fundamental solution processes experienced in complex engineering design projects. The model is based upon the design structure matrix representation and assumes that each individual design activity is of deterministic duration with probabilistic repetition, where the repeat probabilities are defined by the strength of the task coupling. Using the model, we are able to compute the expected duration of the iterative solution process, and to suggest an initial ordering of the coupled design tasks to minimize the expected duration. We conclude the paper with a discussion of limitations and several extensions to the sequential iteration model.

## 6. A Batch Means Methodology for Estimation of a Nonlinear Function of a Steady-State Mean
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
We study the estimation of steady-state performance measures from an d-valued stochastic process Y = {Y(t): t  0} representing the output of a simulation. In many applications, we may be interested in the estimation of a steady-state performance measure that cannot be expressed as a steady-state mean r, e.g., the variance of the steady-state distribution, the ratio of steady-state means, and steady-state conditional expectations. These examples are particular cases of a more general problemthe estimation of a (nonlinear) function f(r) of r. We propose a batch-means-based methodology that allows us to use jackknifing to reduce the bias of the point estimator. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals for f(r) are obtained by combining three different point estimators (classical, batch means, and jackknife) with two different variability estimators (classical and jackknife). The performances of the point estimators are discussed by considering asymptotic expansions for their biases and mean squared errors. Our results show that, if the run length is large enough, the jackknife point estimator provides the smallest bias, with no significant increase in the mean squared error.

## 7. Creativity Enhancement in Problem Solving: Through Software or Process?
### Author(s):

- Joyce J. Elam
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of a controlled laboratory experiment in which the work of Elam and Mead (Elam, J. J., M. Mead. 1990. Can software influence creativity? Inform. Systems Res.1(1) 123.) was both replicated and extended to explore how knowledge and use of a creativity-enhancing process employed both manually and delivered via computer software affect the level of creativity in response to a problem-solving task. The results suggest the enhancement of creativity in response to open-ended problems is significantly affected by the process employed by the decision maker rather than the vehicle by which the process is delivered. Further, the results indicate that the capability of a decision support system (DSS) to provide directed guidance in the application of a process combined with user knowledge of the underlying process model improves creativity enhancement over use of either the DSS or the process alone.

## 8. Using Computers to Realize Joint Gains in Negotiations: Toward an Electronic Bargaining Table
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
Multiissue negotiations present opportunities for tradeoffs that create gains for one or more parties without causing any party to be worse off. The literature suggests that parties are often unable to identify and capitalize on such trades. We present a Negotiation Support System, called NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT, that enables negotiators to analyze their own preferences and provides a structured negotiation process to help parties move toward optimal trades. The underlying model is based on a multiattribute representation of preferences and communications over a computer network where offers and counteroffers are evaluated according to one's own preferences. The parties can send and receive both formal offers and informal messages. If and when agreement is reached, the computer evaluates the agreement and suggests improvements based on the criteria of Pareto-superiority. In this paper, we motivate the system, present its analytical foundations, discuss its design and development, and provide an experimental assessment of its value-in-use. Our results strongly suggest that parties using the system in structured negotiation settings would achieve better outcomes than parties negotiating face to face or over an e-mail messaging facility, other things being equal. For example, only 4 of the 34 dyads (11.1%) negotiating a simulated sales transaction face to face or over e-mail reached an integrative settlement, as compared with 29 of the 68 dyads (42.6%) using NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT. Systems such as NEGOTIATION ASSISTANT have the potential to be used in emerging electronic markets.

## 9. LEOSOptimal Satellite Launch Policies: The Static Case
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1997
### Abstract:
Low earth orbit satellite (LEOS) systems promise to provide global communication. A LEOS system consists of a large number of satellites in low orbits. A satellite has a limited life of approximately five to eight years. Therefore, frequent satellite replenishments are required, and the LEOS systems will be facing annual replenishment costs in the range of several hundred million dollars. This paper considers static satellite launch policies for LEOS systems. The satellite launch problem is formulated and a solution method based on dynamic programming is proposed. Lexicographic ordering is used to reduce the search space of the dynamic program to a moderate size. An algorithm for calculating optimal static policies is used to demonstrate the potentially significant economic impact of satellite launch policies on system maintenance costs.

### Abstract:
Futures market officials are confronted with the difficult task of setting appropriate margin levels that must balance the costs of trader default and the benefits of increased market liquidity. One way to guard against default is prudent margin setting practices designed to protect futures positions from extreme price movements. The objective of this research is to extrapolate the probabilities of encountering extreme price movements by applying statistical extreme value theory to the Finnish stock index futures market. The extreme value technique is found to be appropriate since it generates theoretical margin violation probabilities that closely follow the empirical probability distribution. The extrapolated results provide decision makers information on extreme events that have not yet occurred.
