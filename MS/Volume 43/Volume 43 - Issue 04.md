## 1. Firm Asymmetries and Sequential R&D: Theory and Evidence from the Mainframe Computer Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
We incorporate strategic considerations into the analysis of a problem that has hitherto been treated in a decision theoretic fashion: the allocation of scarce R&D resources when R&D proceeds in stages. In doing so, we formalize a notion of system complexity and investigate its implications for the allocation of these scarce resources. Using detailed data from fieldwork at all mainframe manufacturers in the world to investigate our theoretical predictions, we provide evidence that larger market share firms set more aggressive stage targets, as do more resource-rich firms. Our results can be seen as a verification of the mechanism underlying Arrow's replacement effect.

## 2. Delays in New Product Introductions and the Market Value of the Firm: The Consequences of Being Late to the Market
### Author(s):
- Kevin B. Hendricks
- Vinod R. Singhal
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
This paper empirically estimates the impact of not meeting promised new product introduction dates on the market value of the firm. We estimate the average abnormal change in the market value for a sample of 101 firms around the date when information about delaying the introduction of new products is publicly announced. On average, delay announcements decrease the market value of the firm by 5.25%. The average dollar change in the market value in 1991 dollars is $119.3 million. The evidence suggests that there are significant penalties for not introducing new products on time.

### Abstract:
Intense competition in many industries forces manufacturing firms to develop new, higher quality products at an increasingly rapid pace. Overlapping product development activities is an important component of concurrent product development that can help firms develop products faster. However, since product development activities may be coupled in complex ways, overlapping interrelated activities can present many difficulties. Without careful management of the overlapped product development process, the development effort and cost may increase, and product quality may worsen. This paper goes beyond the common recommendation to simply overlap activities as much as possible. We present a model-based framework to manage the overlapping of coupled product development activities. The model and framework identify conditions under which various types of overlapping are appropriate for a pair of coupled activities. We illustrate the model and framework with industrial applications involving the development of electronic pagers and automobile doors.

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
In fast-cycle, high technology industries, the speed and rate at which companies can introduce products into the market are critical for sustaining competitive advantage and market share. The authors analyze new product development by three international manufacturers that dominate a segment of the electronic component industry. The objective is to examine the impact of two distinct product development strategies and structures on time-to-market.

## 5. Time Versus Market Orientation in Product Concept Development: Empirically-Based Theory Generation
### Author(s):
- Gary Burchill
- Charles H. Fine
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
In collaboration with industry partners, a normative model of the product concept decision process was developed, supported with tools and techniques, and codified as a decision support process for product development teams. This process (Concept Engineering) was then introduced into a number of product development teams in different companies. A comparative analysis of actual product concept development activities, with and without the use of Concept Engineering, was conducted. All of the observed teams viewed time to market as a critical measure of their success. However, the development processes differed significantly depending on whether relatively more emphasis was placed on time or market considerations. Key variables associated with the product concept development decision process and time-to-market dynamics were identified and a theory of the concept development process was developed using the inductive system diagram technique, a research methodology developed in the course of this work.

## 6. The Road to Root Cause: Shop-Floor Problem-Solving at Three Auto Assembly Plants
### Author(s):
- John Paul MacDuffie
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
This paper uses case studies of shop-floor problem-solving at three automotive assembly plants to examine organizational influences on process quality improvement. Three complex quality problemswater leaks, paint defects, and electrical defectswere chosen because they are universally found in assembly plants, have multiple sources, and can only be resolved with high levels of interaction and coordination among individuals in multiple departments or functional groups. The case studies focus particularly on the early stages of the problem-solving processproblem definition, problem analysis, and the generation of solutionsemphasizing how each plant tries to identify the root cause of defects.

## 7. Unanticipated Side Effects of Successful Quality Programs: Exploring a Paradox of Organizational Improvement
### Author(s):
- John D. Sterman

- Fred Kofman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
Recent evidence suggests the connection between quality improvement and financial results may be weak. Consider the case of Analog Devices, Inc., a leading manufacturer of integrated circuits. Analog's TQM program was a dramatic success. Yield doubled, cycle time was cut in half, and product defects fell by a factor of ten. However, financial performance worsened. To explore the apparent paradox we develop a detailed simulation model of Analog, including operations, financial and cost accounting, product development, human resources, the competitive environment, and the financial markets. We used econometric estimation, interviews, observation, and archival data to specify and estimate the model. We find that improvement programs like TQM can present firms with a tradeoff between short and long run effects. In the long run TQM can increase productivity, raise quality, and lower costs. In the short run, these improvements can interact with prevailing accounting systems and organizational routines to create excess capacity, financial stress, and pressure for layoffs that undercut commitment to continuous improvement. We explore policies to promote sustained improvement in financial as well as nonfinancial measures of performance.

## 8. The Performance Effects of Process Management Techniques
### Author(s):
- Christopher D. Ittner
- David F. Larcker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
This paper provides exploratory evidence on the cross-sectional association between process management techniques and two profit measures: return on assets and return on sales. Using a sample of firms in two industries (automotive and computer) and four countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States), we find that certain process management techniques improve profitability while others have little effect on financial performance. In particular, long-term partnerships with suppliers and customers are associated with higher performance in both industries. The value of other techniques such as statistical process control, process capability studies, and cycle time analysis, on the other hand, appears to vary by industry, reflecting differences in the stages of the two industries' process management practices. Finally, computer organizations following an innovation-oriented strategy earned significantly higher accounting returns regardless of the process management techniques employed, suggesting that these techniques have only a second-order effect on performance in this industry.

## 9. Competing in Product and Service: A Product Life-Cycle Model
### Author(s):
- Morris A. Cohen
- Seungjin Whang
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a product life-cycle model that studies a set of strategic choices facing manufacturers as they design the joint product/service bundle for a product which may require maintenance and repair support after its sale. The choice parameters of interest include the product price, the quality of after-sales service and the price to be charged for the after-sales service. We adopt a competitive, game-theoretic (as opposed to single-firm optimization) framework, where there is competition for the provision of after-sales service between the manufacturer and an independent service operator. The product price and the service quality/price are characterized by an equilibrium to a sequential game. The resulting outcome is applied to support the valuation of alternative product designs in explicit consideration of the tradeoff between profit from product sale and from the provision of after-sales service. The model can also be used to evaluate the asset value of a firm's customer base.

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
Consider a series of companies in a supply chain, each of whom orders from its immediate upstream member. In this setting, inbound orders from a downstream member serve as a valuable informational input to upstream production and inventory decisions. This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of orders tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and the distortion tends to increase as one moves upstreama phenomenon termed bullwhip effect. This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations. Actions that can be taken to mitigate the detrimental impact of this distortion are also discussed.

## 11. Quick Response in Manufacturer-Retailer Channels
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1997
### Abstract:
Quick Response (QR) is a movement in the apparel industry to shorten lead time. Under QR, the retailer has the ability to adjust orders based on better demand information. We study how a manufacturer-retailer channel impacts choices of production and marketing variables under QR in the apparel industry. Specifically, we build formal models of the inventory decisions of manufacturers and retailers both before and after QR. Our models allow us to address who wins and who loses under QR, and suggest actions such as service level, wholesale price and volume commitments that can be used to make QR profitable for both members of the channel, i.e., Pareto improving. Detailed discussions with a major retailer, and information from industry sources provide supporting evidence for the structure and conclusions of the model.
