### Abstract:
We show how genetic algorithms can be used to evolve strategies in oligopolistic markets characterized by asymmetric competition. The approach is illustrated using scanner tracking data of brand actions in a real market. An asymmetric market-share model and a category-volume model are combined to represent market response to the actions of brand managers. The actions available to each artificial brand manager are constrained to four typical marketing actions of each from the historical data. Each brand's strategies evolve through simulations of repeated interactions in a virtual market, using the estimated weekly profits of each brand as measures of its fitness for the genetic algorithm. The artificial agents bred in this environment outperform the historical actions of brand managers in the real market. The implications of these findings for the study of marketing strategy are discussed.

## 2. Identifying Controlling Features of Engineering Design Iteration

### Abstract:
Engineering design often involves a very complex set of relationships among a large number of coupled problems. It is this complex coupling that leads to iteration among the various engineering tasks in a large project. The design structure matrix (DSM) is useful in identifying where iteration is necessary. The work transformation matrix model developed in this paper is a powerful extension of the DSM method which can predict slow and rapid convergence of iteration within a project, and predict those coupled features of the design problem which will require many iterations to reach a technical solution. This model is applied to an automotive brake-system development process in order to illustrate the model's utility in describing the main features of an actual design process.

## 3. Integrating Routing and Inventory Decisions in One-Warehouse Multiretailer Multiproduct Distribution Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
We consider distribution systems with a central warehouse and many retailers that stock a number of different products. Deterministic demand occurs at the retailers for each product. The warehouse acts as a break-bulk center and does not keep any inventory. The products are delivered from the warehouse to the retailers by vehicles that combine the deliveries to several retailers into efficient vehicle routes. The objective is to determine replenishment policies that specify the delivery quantities and the vehicle routes used for the delivery, so as to minimize the long-run average inventory and transportation costs. A new heuristic that develops a stationary nested joint replenishment policy for the problem is presented in this paper. Unlike existing methods, the proposed heuristic is capable of solving problems involving distribution systems with multiple products. Results of a computational study on randomly generated single-product problems are also presented.

## 4. Optimizing an International Network of Partially Owned Plants Under Conditions of Trade Liberalization

### Abstract:
For the last four decades the preferred economic philosophy in much of Latin America was that of import-substituting industrialization. As a result multinational corporations (MNCs) approached different countries with the expectation that each plant would primarily serve its domestic market. Each of these plants was partially owned by the MNC. Beginning in the late 1980s, Latin America countries began decreasing barriers to cross-border trade. This made competition between the units belonging to a common network possible for the first time. Operations which had subsisted side by side in spite of differences in costs and quality of output, and which were under the control of different owners now found themselves in competition with one another and having to rationalize their efforts. In this paper we analyze the problem of operating a network of plants under conditions of free trade and exchange rate fluctuations, when the firms that compose it are partially-owned subsidiaries of an MNC. A model of three subsidiaries and four countries is developed for one industry, based on actual corporate and economic data. We study the problem of coordinating the activities of the subsidiaries and allocating the gains arising from coordination.

## 5. Replenishment and Stocking Policies for Inventory Systems with Random Deal Offerings
### Author(s):
- Kamran Moinzadeh
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
This paper considers the replenishment and stocking decision for inventory systems in which price discounts, referred to as deals, are offered by the supplier (or the market place) at random points in time. Assuming that the demand is constant over time, the times between deal offerings are exponentially distributed and that the order leadtimes are negligible, we derive expressions for evaluating the operating characteristics of the model. Moreover, we derive expressions for determining the optimal policy parameters for such systems and present results on the behavior of the optimal policy parameters. Our results are easy to implement, intuitive and provide managerial insights and a better understanding on the effect of random deal offerings on replenishment and stocking decisions. In addition, we suggest a back of envelope heuristic solution for deriving the policy parameters.

## 6. The Relationship Between a Firm's Level of Technological Innovativeness and Its Pattern of Partnership Agreements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
In this paper we investigate the relationship between the level of a firm's technological innovativeness and its pattern of partnership agreements (i.e., relative number of partnership agreements of one type versus another). We argue that the protection of tacit technological knowledge from potential opportunism is of importance to technologically innovative firms, and as a result they tend to have a relatively larger number of partnership agreements which generally minimize the transfer of tacit technological knowledge. Specifically, they tend to have a greater number of marketing agreements than joint ventures and a greater number of licensing agreements than joint ventures. This argument is tested using data from manufacturing firms in the electrical and electronics machinery sector who invest in R&D, and our results hold for our focal firm's agreements with both domestic and foreign partners. We discuss the strategic and policy implications from this research. In particular, the empirical results suggest that technologically innovative firms already have relatively more agreements which are likely to preempt transfer of their tacit technological knowledge to their foreign partners. Thus, recent suggestions of more active government regulation in the area of intellectual property may be unwarranted.

## 7. The Relationship Between Risk Attitude and Strength of Preference: A Test of Intrinsic Risk Attitude
### Author(s):
- Ale Smidts
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
In a field study, the concept of intrinsic risk attitude is investigated. Intrinsic risk attitude concerns the relationship between risk attitude, measured by the utility function u(x), and strength of preference, measured by the value function v(x). We study farmers' decision-making vis--vis price risk and obtain assessments of risk attitude and strength of preference in two consecutive years in a sample of 253 respondents. This design enables us to investigate the temporal stability of intrinsic risk attitude. Our findings show that risk attitude and strength of preference are two distinctive constructs. More specifically, the hypothesis of a linear relationship between u(x) and v(x) is clearly rejected in favor of an exponential relationship. This exponential relationship implies that our respondents exhibit a constant absolute intrinsic risk attitude for different price levels, during a time period. Differences between respondents in direction and degree of intrinsic risk attitude are substantial and the majority of the respondents are intrinsically risk seeking. No statistically significant change in intrinsic risk attitude could be detected between the two years of measurement. However, the correlation between measures across time appears to be low. In the discussion, issues for further research are identified.

## 8. Nonlinearities in the Relation Between the Equity Risk Premium and the Term Structure
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the relation between the conditional expected equity risk premium and the slope of the term structure of interest rates. Theoretically, these variables are linked, the relation may be nonlinear, and negative risk premiums are consistent with equilibrium. Given these implications, we employ a nonparametric estimation technique to document the empirical relation between the risk premium and the slope of the term structure using almost two hundred years of data. Of particular interest, the risk premium is increasing in the term structure slope; however, for either small or negative slopes, the risk premium is much more sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, the empirical results imply negative expected equity risk premiums for some inverted term structures. Finally, variations in the risk premium do not appear to be related to variations in the variance of equity returns. We illustrate these features in a stylized consumption-based model, and provide the economic intuition behind the results.

## 9. Prescribing Tactical Response for Oil Spill Clean Up Operations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1997
### Abstract:
The Tactical Decision Problem (TDP) associated with oil spill clean up operations prescribes the time-phased allocation of available components over the planning horizon so that the clean up requirement at each critical time point is met. The objective is to minimize response time to allow for the most effective clean up possible. In this paper, we formulate the TDP as a general integer program. We devise a method based on graph theory to efficiently generate response system types (RSTs), including constituent components, the locations from which each of the component types is obtained, and the staging area at which that RST is composed. We present several pre-processing methods and derive expressions for bounds on decision variables to facilitate solution. We then develop two heuristics to obtain approximate solutions to the TDP. The first heuristic is an LP-based method, while the second uses a combination of LP relaxation and branch and bound. The two heuristics are compared on problems that are based on realistic scenarios representing application in the Galveston Bay Area.
