### Abstract:
To assess probabilities in decision analysis, and for decision making in general, decision makers must evoke and apply relevant information. Decision analysts have developed a variety of structuring tools to aid decision makers in these tasks, including influence diagrams and knowledge maps. However, despite their pervasive use in practice, there have been no reported empirical tests of these tools. One goal of the present research was to provide an empirical test of the evocative knowledge map methodology. Second, a theoretical analysis of probability assessment was used to develop a new prescriptive elicitation technique. This technique uses a theoretically-grounded set of directed questions to help decision makers evoke information for probability assessment. Experimental results showed that both the knowledge map and the new directed questions methodology elicited a higher quantity and quality of information from decision makers engaged in probability assessment tasks than did a control condition. Further, the information elicited by the two techniques was qualitatively different, suggesting that the two methods might profitably be used as complementary elicitation techniques.

## 2. Fairness and Social Risk II: Aggregated Analyses
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
- Rakesh K. Sarin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
This paper is the second of a two-paper study of fairness issues for decisions that affect the benefits received and the risks encountered by a population. The study examines fairness for individuals and for homogeneous groups within the population. It considers fairness both for population benefit-risk profiles and for probability distributions over profiles.

## 3. Quality, Class, and Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
This paper integrates the process oriented view of quality in manufacturing with the multi-attribute product positioning and customer preference models of marketing, within the context of traditional economic models of markets and competition. In manufacturing applications, quality is often defined as conformance to specifications or as meeting standards on the performance of the product. In the marketing and economics literature, quality typically refers to the performance level or class of the product. To capture both perspectives, a product is described by a vector of performance attributes, and the population of produced units is assumed to display a distribution on these attributes. The distribution perceived by customers may differ from the actual. The attribute levels (means) may be taken to define the class, or performance of the product. Quality in the sense of conformance is then conceptually identified with the absence of variation of the population. Consumer preferences are modelled by a cardinal utility function defined on the vector of attributes and price, and customers maximize expected utility. Product manufacturers are assumed to face a cost of producing a given population distribution. Under specific assumptions regarding costs and utility functions, models of monopoly, oligopoly and perfect competition are formulated. The model clarifies the distinction between product class (performance) and conformance quality, identifies the sources of quality improvement, and provides an economic framework relating issues like product positioning, process improvement, quality function deployment (QFD) and customer preference estimation. This framework is used to address issues such as quality costs and benefits and the economics of investments in quality.

## 4. Modelling the Costs and Benefits of Delayed Product Differentiation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
Expanding product variety and high customer service provision are both major challenges for manufacturers to compete in the global market. In addition to many ongoing programs, such as lead-time reduction, redesigning products and processes so as to delay the point of product differentiation is becoming an emerging means to address these challenges. Such a strategy calls for redesigning products and processes so that the stages of the production process in which a common process is used are prolonged. This product/process redesign will defer the point of differentiation (i.e., defer the stage after which the products assume their unique identities). In this paper, we develop a simple model that captures the costs and benefits associated with this redesign strategy. We apply this simple model to analyze some special cases that are motivated by real examples. These special cases enable us to formalize three different product/process redesign approaches (standardization, modular design, and process restructuring) for delaying product differentiation that some companies are beginning to pursue. Finally, we analyze some special theoretical cases that enable us to characterize the optimal point of product differentiation and derive managerial insights.

## 5. Closed-Loop Advertising Strategies in a Duopoly
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
Using the Lanchester model to describe the dynamics of the market where two firms compete for customers by advertising, we solve the problem of determining an optimal advertising strategy for maximum discounted profits. We develop both open- and closed-loop strategies and explain the relationship between them. Using a new mathematical approach, we prove that our closed-loop solution is a global Nash equilibrium. The closed-loop strategy is time-variant and depends linearly on the actual market share. The time-variant coefficient incorporates the discount factor, its computation requires the solution of a backward differential equation and a set of two nonlinear differential equations for an initial value problem. The closed-loop advertising expenditures are proportional to the open-loop advertising expenditures and to the square of the competitor's actual market share. This provides a very practical adaptive control rule that allows the manager to adjust the actual advertising expenditure and to deviate from budget. We illustrate the use of our control rule, using data for the period 19681984 of the Cola War Marketing implications of the results are provided.

## 6. Periodic Pricing of Seasonal Products in Retailing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
This paper studies intertemporal pricing policies when selling seasonal products in retail stores. We first present a continuous time model where a seller faces a stochastic arrival of customers with different valuations of the product. For this model, we characterize the optimal pricing policies as functions of time and inventory. We use this model as a benchmark against which we compare more realistic models that consider periodic pricing reviews. We show that the structure of the optimal pricing policies in this case is consistent with the procedures observed in practice; retail stores successively discount the product during the season and promote a liquidation sale at the end of the planning horizon. We also show that the loss experienced when implementing periodic pricing reviews instead of continuous policies is small when the appropriate number of reviews is chosen. Several interesting economic insights emerge from our analysis. For example, uncertainty in the demand for new products leads to higher prices, larger discounts, and more unsold inventory. Finally, we study the effect of announced discount policies on prices and profits. We show that stores that have adopted this type of strategy usually set prices such that with high probability the merchandise is sold during the first periods and the largest discounts rarely take place.

## 7. The Lagged PSA for Estimating Peak Congestion in Multiserver Markovian Queues with Periodic Arrival Rates
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
We propose using a modification of the simple peak hour approximation (SPHA) for estimating peak congestion in multiserver queueing systems with exponential service times and time-varying periodic Poisson arrivals. This lagged pointwise stationary approximation (lagged PSA) is obtained by first estimating the time of the actual peak congestion by the time of peak congestion in an infinite server model and then substituting the arrival rate at this time in the corresponding stationary finite server model. We show that the lagged PSA is always more accurate than the SPHA and results in dramatically smaller errors when average service times are greater than a half an hour (based on a 24 hour period). More importantly, the lagged PSA reliably identifies proper staffing levels to meet targeted performance levels to keep congestion low.

## 9. The Feasibility of an Index-Contingent Trading Mechanism
### Author(s):
- Avi Wohl
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1997
### Abstract:
Auction or call trading systems are used in many stock exchanges. An essential problem in the application of these systems is that orders in one security cannot be conditioned on prices of other securities. This paper proposes and analyzes the feasibility of an index-contingent trading system. In this system, limit orders may be conditioned on an index (any weighted average of the security prices that is determined simultaneously with the prices) in addition to the asset price. Without any assumptions about traders' behavior it is shown that under a reasonable restriction on the structure of the limit orders, there is a unique solution (vector of prices) to any set of orders in all securities. Moreover, the paper presents a quick and simple algorithm that converges to the solution. This algorithm is based on an extension of the current mechanisms; therefore it can be implemented easily in any computerized auction system.

## 10. Remarks on: Some Extensions of the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Saloman et al. (Salomon, M., L. G. Kroon, R. Kuik, L. N. Van Wassenhove. 1991. Some extensions of the discrete lotsizing and scheduling problem. Management Sci.37 801812.) claim the NP-completeness of different variants of the discrete lot-sizing and scheduling problem (DLSP) which are differentiated by using a six-field notation. However, some of the given proofs are incorrect because the transformations employed map certain data values of the preimage problem to the number of data in the resulting instance and are hence not polynomial. As an example, we concentrate here on the 1/*/SI/G/A-optimization problem (Salomon et al. [Salomon, M., L. G. Kroon, R. Kuik, L. N. Van Wassenhove. 1991. Some extensions of the discrete lotsizing and scheduling problem. Management Sci.37 801812.], Theorem 3). Similar arguments pertain to the 1/*/A/G/SI-DLSP, too.
