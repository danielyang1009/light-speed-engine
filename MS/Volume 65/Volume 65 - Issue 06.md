### Abstract:
In this paper, we document a positive effect of supplier–customer geographic proximity on supplier innovation. To establish causality, we explore plausibly exogenous variation in proximity caused by customer relocations. The positive effect of supplier–customer proximity on supplier innovation is stronger when customers are more innovative themselves, when suppliers and customers are closer in technological space, and when customers’ demand accounts for a larger fraction of suppliers’ total sales. These findings suggest that the feedback channel and the demand channel are likely underlying mechanisms through which supplier–customer proximity affects supplier innovation. Overall, our paper sheds new light on the real effect of supplier–customer relationship on corporate innovation.

### Published:
- 19 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
The paper considers a model of competition among firms that produce a homogeneous good in a networked environment. A bipartite graph determines which subset of markets a firm can supply to. Firms compete à la Cournot and decide how to allocate their production output to the markets they are directly connected to. We provide a characterization of the production quantities at the unique equilibrium of the resulting game for any given network. Our results identify a novel connection between the equilibrium outcome and supply paths in the underlying network structure. We then proceed to study the impact of changes in the competition structure, for example, due to a firm expanding into a new market or two firms merging, on firms’ profits and consumer surplus. The modeling framework we propose can be used in assessing whether expanding in a new market is profitable for a firm, identifying opportunities for collaboration, for example, a joint venture between competing firms, and guiding regulatory action in the context of market design and antitrust analysis.

## 3. Separate and Concentrate: Accounting for Patient Complexity in General Hospitals

### Published:
- 14 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
Scholars have recently suggested the reorganization of general hospitals into organizationally separate divisions for routine and non-routine services to overcome operational misalignments between the two types of services. We provide empirical evidence for this proposal from a quality perspective, using over 250,000 patient discharge records from 60 German hospitals across 39 high-mortality disease segments, and focusing on in-hospital mortality as outcome. Disentangling the effects of high, absolute, and relative hospital volumes in a disease group, our analysis suggests that routine and complex patients would benefit from a hospital organization with a multi-specialty hub for emergency and non-routine elective services at its core, complemented by organizationally separate disease-focused hospitals-within-hospitals for routine services. We also provide evidence that the hub hospital can further improve service quality for complex patients by adopting a disease-based rather than medical specialty-based departmental routing strategy for newly arriving patients. A counterfactual analysis, based on a simultaneous equations probit model that simultaneously controls for endogeneity of volume, focus, and routing strategy, suggests that the proposed reorganization could have reduced mortality in the sample by 13.43% (95% CI [6.87%; 18.95%]) for routine patients and by 11.67% (95% CI [6.13%; 16.86%]) for the most complex patients.

## 4. Fostering Entrepreneurship: Promoting Founding or Funding?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
Governments across the globe are eager to foster entrepreneurial ecosystems, yet there is no consensus on what policies to use. We develop a theory about the equilibrium consequences of two canonical types of entrepreneurship policies: policies that encourage entrepreneurs to found new ventures and policies that encourage investors to fund new ventures. We distinguish between a short-term impact on current market activity versus a long-term impact on future activity. Investing in entrepreneurial ventures requires tacit knowledge that is mainly acquired through prior entrepreneurial experience, implying that the supply of capital depends on successful entrepreneurs from prior generations. Recognizing this intergenerational linkage has a profound impact on the market equilibrium and the effect of entrepreneurship policies. Our analysis identifies a rationale for using funding polices.

## 5. Good and Bad Variance Premia and Expected Returns
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
We measure “good” and “bad” variance premia that capture risk compensations for the realized variation in positive and negative market returns, respectively. The two variance premium components jointly predict excess returns over the next one and two years with statistically significant positive (negative) coefficients on the good (bad) component. The R2s reach about 10% for aggregate equity and portfolio returns and 20% for corporate bond returns. To explain the new empirical evidence, we develop a model that highlights the differential impact of upside and downside risk on equity and variance risk premia.

## 6. Lobbying on Regulatory Enforcement Actions: Evidence from U.S. Commercial and Savings Banks
### Author(s):
- Thomas Lambert
### Published:
- 19 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the relationship between bank lobbying and supervisory decisions of regulators and documents its moral hazard implications. Exploiting bank-level information on the universe of commercial and savings banks in the United States, I find that regulators are 44.7% less likely to initiate enforcement actions against lobbying banks. This result is robust across measures of lobbying and accounts for endogeneity concerns by employing instrumental variables strategies. In addition, I show that lobbying banks are riskier and reliably underperform their nonlobbying peers. Overall, these results appear rather inconsistent with an information-based explanation of bank lobbying, but consistent with the theory of regulatory capture.

## 7. Design Implications of Extended Producer Responsibility for Durable Products
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2019
### Abstract:
We analyze product design implications of extended producer responsibility (EPR)-based take-back legislation on durable goods. In particular, we observe that durable product design incentives under EPR may involve an inherent trade-off that has not been explored to date: Durable goods producers can respond to EPR by making their products more recyclable or more durable, where the former decreases the unit recycling cost and the latter reduces the volume the producer has to recycle. When these two design attributes do not go hand in hand, as is the case for many product categories, product design implications of EPR can be counterintuitive. We find that more stringent collection targets (defined as the portion of total product volume to be collected) or recycling targets (defined as the portion of each collected product unit to be recycled) may imply reduced recyclability or durability. Moreover, although collection and recycling targets appear to be similar EPR implementation levers for increasing the total amount of materials recycled, they, in fact, have opposing effects in driving producers’ design choices. As a result, EPR may have unintended consequences for the environment. A calibrated numerical study on the photovoltaic panel (PVP) industry allows us to show that more stringent EPR requirements (such as those proposed by the recent recast of the WEEE directive) can lead to a PVP technology choice with lower recyclability and higher durability and, consequently, result in higher greenhouse gas emissions. These results call for a careful analysis of the benefits of EPR legislation in the context of durable goods.

## 8. Strategic Selection of Risk Models and Bank Capital Regulation
### Author(s):
- Jean-Edouard Colliard
### Published:
- 29 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
The regulatory use of banks’ internal models makes capital requirements more risk sensitive but invites regulatory arbitrage. I develop a framework to study bank regulation with strategic selection of risk models. A bank supervisor can discourage arbitrage by auditing risk models and implements capital ratios less risk sensitive than in the first-best to reduce auditing costs. The optimal capital ratios of a national supervisor can be different from those set by supranational authorities, in which case the supervisor optimally tolerates biased models. I discuss the empirical implications of this “hidden model” problem, and policy answers such as leverage ratios and more reliance on backtesting mechanisms.

## 9. Consumer Search and Retail Market Structure
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
A puzzling feature of many retail markets is the coexistence of large multiproduct firms and smaller firms with narrow product ranges. This paper provides a possible explanation for this puzzle, by studying how consumer search frictions influence the structure of retail markets. In our model, single-product firms that supply different products can merge to form a multiproduct firm. Consumers wish to buy multiple products and, due to search frictions, value the one-stop shopping convenience associated with a multiproduct firm. We find that, when search frictions are relatively large, all firms are multiproduct in equilibrium. However, when search frictions are smaller, the equilibrium market structure is asymmetric, with different retail formats coexisting. This allows firms to better segment the market and, as such, typically leads to the weakest price competition. When search frictions are low, this asymmetric market structure is also the worst for consumers. Moreover, due to the endogeneity of market structure, a reduction in the search friction can increase market prices and harm consumers.

## 10. Finding a Needle in a Haystack: The Effects of Searching and Learning on Pick-Worker Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
The rise in online and multichannel retailing has pushed retailers to give increased attention to their order-fulfillment operations. We study “chaotic storage” fulfillment systems in which dissimilar items are stored together in a single location. This necessitates a searching task as part of the picking process, which has not been previously studied. We show that pick times increase by as much as 16% as the searching task becomes more difficult. However, the deleterious effect of searching decreases with pick-worker experience. Using simulation, we show that pick times can be improved by incorporating distance, bin density, and picker experience into pick assignments and pick routing. Through properly combining the details of the task and the workers, order-fulfillment productivity can be increased by approximately 5%.

## 11. Information Sale and Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
This paper studies the strategic interaction between a monopolistic seller of an information product and a set of potential buyers that compete in a downstream market. The setting is motivated by information markets in which (i) sellers have the ability to offer information products of different qualities and (ii) the information product provides potential buyers not only with more precise information about the fundamentals, but also with a coordination device that can be used in their strategic interactions with their competitors. Our results illustrate that the nature and intensity of competition among the information provider’s customers play first-order roles in determining the information provider’s optimal strategy. We show that when the customers view their actions as strategic complements, the provider finds it optimal to offer the most accurate information at the provider’s disposal to all potential customers. In contrast, when buyers view their actions as strategic substitutes, the provider maximizes the provider’s profits by either (i) restricting the overall supply of the information product or (ii) distorting its content by offering a product of inferior quality. We also establish that the provider’s incentive to restrict the supply or quality of information provided to the downstream market intensifies in the presence of information leakage.

## 12. Intertemporal Price Discrimination with Complementary Products: E-Books and E-Readers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
This paper studies intertemporal price discrimination (IPD) with complementary products in the context of e-readers and e-books. Using individual-level data (2008–2012), I estimate a dynamic demand model for e-reader adoption and subsequent book quantity, reading format, and retailer choices in several book genres. I use the estimates to simulate a monopolist’s optimal dynamic pricing strategies when facing forward-looking consumers. The results illustrate how skimming/penetration pricing incentives for e-readers and harvesting/investing incentives for e-books interact in this novel setting. The optimal joint IPD strategy is skimming for e-readers and investing for e-books. Counterfactual results suggest that combining IPD with complementary product pricing improves firm profitability because it attenuates the limitations of each pricing approach. In a single-product IPD setting, firms’ pricing power is limited when consumers anticipate future price changes and delay purchases. Adding complementary products offers firms two pricing instruments; opposite price trajectories provide conflicting incentives for consumers, limiting intertemporal arbitrage. In a static complementary product setting, firms’ pricing power is limited when the relative elasticity between the two products is heterogeneous and conflicting among consumers. Adding IPD sorts heterogeneous consumers into different periods and reduces the need to balance across consumer types.

### Published:
- 19 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
This paper seeks to understand the relational factors that may affect the decisions of both third-party raters and service providers in a setting where service providers compete with one another. We employ laboratory economics experiments to examine how removing anonymity and allowing for repeated interactions between the rater and the service provider impact both the ratings assigned by the rater and the quality levels expended by the service provider. Our methodology enables us to observe the true quality level chosen by a service provider, which allows us to accurately detect any bias in the assessment of the third-party rater. The experimental results show that the decisions of both the rater and the service provider are very sensitive to the relational factors that govern their interaction. When the rater and the service provider know each other’s identities, we observe a high proportion of overrating even though raters earn less monetary rewards for doing so, and the propensity to overrate is even stronger with repeated interactions. Furthermore, the service provider chooses low quality levels. We develop and estimate a model that captures the rater’s psychological trade-off between remaining objective and helping the service provider compete in the marketplace, and the evolution of the service provider’s beliefs about the rater’s preferences.

## 14. Mobile Messaging for Offline Group Formation in Prosocial Activities: A Large Field Experiment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
In this paper, we use mobile messaging to leverage recipients’ social ties and encourage offline prosocial activities in groups. In particular, we conduct a randomized field experiment with 80,000 blood donors and study how behavioral interventions and economic rewards motivate offline group formation. We find that two commonly used interventions—reminder messages and individual reward—are ineffective in motivating group formation because they do not compensate donors for the cost of bringing friends. In contrast, we find that group reward—a new reward that is contingent on a donor bringing a friend—is effective in motivating group formation. Furthermore, group reward tends to attract different types of donors, especially those who are traditionally less active in online social settings but have more local social ties. Structural estimation further reveals the underlying mechanisms, suggesting that group reward is four times more cost-effective than individual reward in driving total donation. Our study suggests that motivating offline group formation is a promising approach to boost prosocial activities.

### Published:
- 21 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
Based on a dynamic model of the stochastic repayment behavior exhibited by delinquent credit-card accounts in the form of a self-exciting point process, a bank can control the arrival intensity of repayments using costly account-treatment actions. A semi-analytic solution to the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem is obtained using a recursive approach. For a linear cost of treatment effort, the optimal policy in the two-dimensional (intensity, balance) space is described by the frontier of a convex action region. The unique optimal policy significantly reduces a bank’s loss given default and concentrates the collection effort onto the best possible actions at the best possible times so as to minimize the sum of the expected discounted outstanding balance and the discounted cost of the collection effort, thus maximizing the net value of any given delinquent credit-card account.

## 16. Dynamic Multisourcing with Dependent Supplies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Mar 2019
### Abstract:
As multisourcing becomes a widely adopted strategy in dynamic procurement planning, firms inevitably source from suppliers with dependent material flows, and such supply dependence, created by common second-tier suppliers or a common economic environment, is often positive. We show that firms can experience significant profit loss when implementing a policy computed based on a model that ignores the dependence among suppliers’ stochastic material flows. The profit loss is particularly significant when a firm earns a low margin or faces an unreliable and fragmented supplier base. Analysis of the firm’s dynamic multisourcing strategy under dependent supply uncertainties, however, is challenging. By expanding the space of ordering decision to a class of contingency policies, we identify conditions under which the dynamic planning model has a concave transformation. This approach allows us to characterize the optimal procurement policy. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the firm may order more from a less reliable supplier than from a more reliable one who charges the same procurement cost. The order allocation to the less reliable supplier can be even larger when the capacities are more dependent. Though the analysis of our base model is conducted for dependent supply capacities that are independent across periods, we show that the results can be generalized to Markov-modulated supplies or general supply functions that are stochastically linear in midpoint.

## 17. Mix Stickiness Under Asymmetric Cost Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Jan 2019
### Abstract:
In most organizations, the agent has superior information about the relative costs of different products or activities. This handicaps the principal when the principal seeks to adjust the product mix. Our main conceptual finding is that there is “mix stickiness.” The agent’s superior information about the relative costs of different products or activities leads to an advantage for the status quo; that is, there is inertia (or stickiness) in the mix of products or activities pursued. The historical mix has an advantage because the asymmetric information about relative costs has less of an impact when the mix does not change. If the mix changes, the producer can extract information rents by claiming high costs on the least reduced or most expanded products. Only in the case of larger shifts in the environment will the mix change. Changing the mix comes with the advantage of making rationing cheaper. Our analysis gives new insight into several business practices. It suggests, for example, that for moderate downsizing, a reinforcement approach of proportionally cutting all activities (lawn mowing) is optimal. When more dramatic downsizing is called for, a reorientation approach of eliminating certain activities (divesting) is optimal. It also suggests that outsourcing may come at the cost of reduced adaptability, and it may help explain why most, if not all, healthcare systems struggle to control cost.

### Abstract:
To what extent does expertise depend on context? We observe professionals perform a task that is logically isomorphic to—but contextually distinct from—a familiar task in which they are skilled. We find that performance plummets when contextual cues disappear, suggesting that the expertise we observe on the familiar task is more heuristic than conceptual and does not travel far.

### Abstract:
The pari passu principle of awarding claimants proportionally to their pre-insolvency claims is the most prominent principle in the law of insolvency. We report from a lab experiment designed to study whether people find this principle a fair solution to the bankruptcy problem. The experimental design generates situations where participants work and accumulate claims in firms, some of which subsequently go bankrupt. Third-party arbitrators are randomly assigned to determine how the liquidation value of the bankrupt firms should be distributed between claimants. Our main finding is that there is a striking support for the pari passu principle. We estimate a random utility model that allows for the arbitrators to differ in what they consider a fair solution to the bankruptcy problem and find that about 85% of the participants endorse the proportional rule. We also find that a nonnegligible fraction of the arbitrators follow the constrained equal losses rule, while there is almost no support in our experiment for the constrained equal awards rule or other fairness rules suggested in the normative literature.

## 21. Inferring Commitment from Rates of Organizational Transition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 9 Apr 2018
### Abstract:
Organizations often implement changes that can signal their values. However, the most objectively efficient changes do not necessarily serve as the best signals. Across seven experiments, we investigate how different rates of transition influence people’s perceptions of how committed organizations are to the values underlying changes or improvements. We find that slower, less efficient transitions signal greater commitment compared with faster, more efficient transitions that reach otherwise identical endpoints (Experiment 1). Using mediation and moderation strategies, we demonstrate that this discontinuity occurs because people assume slower transitions require relatively more effort to enact (Experiments 2 and 3). Moreover, these commitment inferences persist beyond the point at which changes end (Experiment 4), when further improvement along the same dimension is no longer possible (Experiment 5), and regardless of whether the organization decided to transition either quickly or slowly (Experiment 6). This effect reverses, however, when people can directly compare slower and faster transitions that ultimately reach identical endpoints (Experiment 7). Taken together, these findings suggest that people often infer greater commitment from slower transitions that unfold over time, even when those transitions are objectively inferior to faster alternatives.

### Abstract:
We propose that hedge funds more aggressively buy underpriced stocks when they are allowed to short. To test our proposition, we utilize the institutional feature in Hong Kong in virtue of which only stocks added to a special list can be shorted. Our first-stage analysis uses hedge fund holdings data and provides evidence that the emergency of shortable securities, indeed, causes hedge funds to more aggressively buy seemingly underpriced stocks. Our second-stage analysis presents evidence that hedge funds’ increased involvement in these stocks helps correct underpricing and moves prices in the direction of fundamentals.

### Published:
- 29 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
We use 10-K filings to construct novel text-based measures of the extent to which U.S. firms are exposed to three offshore activities: the sale of output, purchase of input, and ownership of producing assets. Our main result is that selling output abroad is associated with higher stock returns, especially when output is sold to more central nations in the real trade network. In contrast, offshore input serves as a hedge. Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that aggregate quantity shocks are the primary source of the return premium we document in the global trade network.

## 24. Asset Pricing with Disagreement and Uncertainty About the Length of Business Cycles
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
We study an economy with incomplete information in which two agents are uncertain and disagree about the length of business cycles. That is, the agents do not question whether the economy is growing or not, but instead continuously estimate how long economic cycles will last—i.e., they learn about the persistence of fundamentals. Learning about persistence generates high and persistent stock return volatility mostly during recessions, but also (to a smaller extent) during economic booms. Disagreement among agents fluctuates and earns a risk premium. A clear risk–return trade-off appears only when conditioning on the sign and magnitude of disagreement. We confirm these predictions empirically.

### Published:
- 19 Feb 2019
### Abstract:
This study examines the effect of psychological contract breach on budgetary misreporting. Psychological contracts are mental models or schemas that govern how employees understand their exchange relationships with their employers. Psychological contract breach leads to feelings of violation and can occur even when employees’ economic contracts are fulfilled. We study the effects of psychological contract breach on three common types of employee participation in budgeting that differ in the degree of employees’ influence over their approved budgets. These include affirmative budgeting (full influence), consultative budgeting (moderate influence), and authoritative budgeting (low influence). When organizations communicate that employees will be involved in budgeting, employees develop psychological contracts of affirmative budgeting. If employees subsequently experience authoritative or consultative budgeting, their psychological contracts are breached. Employees who experience psychological contract breach seek redress through budgetary misreporting. Experimental results indicate that psychological contract breach partially mediates the relation between budgeting type and budgetary misreporting. Results also indicate asymmetry in the effects of psychological contract breach versus repair. Effects of breach on budgetary misreporting persist even after the breach no longer occurs.
