### Abstract:
In an important study reviewing the literature on econometric studies of the relationship between advertising and sales Clarke (Clarke, Darral G. 1976. Econometric measurement of the duration of advertising effects on sales. J. Marketing Res.13 (November) 345357.) concluded that the implied duration interval of the effects of advertising on sales were too long when the studies used annual data. A theoretical explanation is provided here for the observation of parameter estimates which vary with the data interval employed in the analysis. Parameter estimates are developed on the basis of data aggregated at various levels of temporal aggregation and compared with theoretical values. It is demonstrated that it is possible to recover bimonthly parameters when only annual data are available.

## 2. Uncertainty, Social Location and Influence in Decision Making: A Sociometric Analysis
### Author(s):
- Michael L. Tushman

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
This research investigates the relative impacts of formal status and informal communication roles on influence in administrative and technical decision making. While external information enters the organization via boundary spanning individuals, the exercise of influence at lower levels of the organization is dependent on mediating critical organizational contingencies. As the locus of task uncertainty shifts, so too does the relative influence of boundary spanning individuals and internal stars; the greater the task and environmental uncertainty, the greater the influence of boundary spanning individuals. Senior management are influential across task areas. The formal hierarchy and informal social processes complement each other in the exercise of influence. These results extend research which indicates that different information processing requirements require systematically different organizational processes to attend to that uncertainty.

## 4. Organizational Life Cycles and Shifting Criteria of Effectiveness: Some Preliminary Evidence
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Quinn
- Kim Cameron
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the relationships between stage of development in organizational life cycles and organizational effectiveness. We begin the paper by reviewing nine models of organizational life cycles that have been proposed in the literature. Each of these models identifies certain characteristics that typify organizations in different stages of development. A summary model of life cycle stages is derived that integrates each of these nine models.

## 5. A Corporate System Model of a Sports Club: Using Simulation as an Aid to Policy Making in a Crisis
### Author(s):

- William B. Menzies
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
The sports club, described in this study, was losing members and in dire financial straits. It became obvious from the optimistic forecasts and fragmented historical records that the membership system was poorly understood by the club's decision making groups and committees. A corporate system model of the club was developed from interviews with the club executive and influential club members. In this way an understanding was gained of the fundamental system of relations determining the viability of the club. Various suggestions for remedial action were tried out on a simulation version of the model and the results communicated to the board of directors. The study serves to illustrate the use of computer simulation modeling, not as an optimising or forecasting tool, but as an aid to policy making in a crisis. It became part of the organizational behavior process for coping with an extreme situation that, in this case, had a happy ending. The study attempts to relate the scientific process of synthesizing a formal model with the psychological and socio-political processes of decision making in a complex system during a crisis.

## 6. A Sensitivity Analysis of Variable-Base Budgeting
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Blanning
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
In variable-base budgeting an organization's resources are partitioned into two categories, those allocated to decision making and those allocated to implementation, and both sets of resources are further subdivided as necessarybetween departments, across time stages, etc. The purpose of the budgeting effort is to maximize an expected return, which depends on that part of the organization's resources allocated to implementation, net of risk, which is reduced by allocating resources to decision making. In a previous paper it was shown that zero-base budgeting, in which substantial resources are allocated to decision making, is optimal only under certain conditions, one of which is that management resources must be costless. Since these conditions seldom obtain in the real world, it seems reasonable to examine the sensitivity of the risk/return performance of a zero-base strategy with respect to deviations from the conditions for which that strategy is optimal. The principal conclusion of the research reported here is that the mesa phenomenonthe relative insensitivity of the outcome of resource allocation decisions in the neighborhood of the optimumapplies to the allocation of management resources as well.

## 7. A Hybrid Algorithm for Simultaneous Scheduling of Production and Distribution in Multi-Echelon Structures
### Author(s):
- Jack F. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
This paper presents a dynamic programming algorithm for simultaneous determination of production batch sizes in an assembly network and distribution batch sizes in a conjoined distribution (arborescent) network. The objective is to minimize average cost per period over an infinite horizon. Costs consist of processing costs at each node and linear holding costs for inventory. Final product demand rates may vary among the retail nodes, but at each retail node the demand rate is assumed to be known, constant, and continuous. All demand must be met; backorders are not permitted. The model can be used for a single product, or for several products that are temporarily combined for distribution, or for scheduling production in a system where several end products are produced from the same intermediate product, as in some biochemical manufacturing processes.

## 8. On the General Feasibility Test of Scheduling Lot Sizes for Several Products on One Machine
### Author(s):
- Wen-Lian Hsu
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
Given N products and a set of basic data for each product, e.g., production rate, demand rate, setup time, setup cost and holding cost, etc., the Economic Lot Scheduling Problem is to find a feasible schedule that allows cyclic production pattern for each product and such that the sum of the setup and inventory carrying costs for all products per unit time is minimized. The routine application of the economic lot size formula to each product separately, often leads to the phenomenon of interference, i.e., the machine will be required to produce two items at the same time, which is impossible. In this paper we show that even a very restricted version of the original problem becomes NP-hard. We also give an implicit enumeration procedure for testing the feasibility of a schedule in which product i is set up i (integer) times per year. The main advantage of our procedure is that we can by-pass the tedious study of the start times and concentrate on the combinatorial structure of the production runs, which thus, theoretically cuts down the number of possible branchings in the enumeration.

## 9. Optimal Advertising with Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- George E. Monahan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
A stochastic, sequential model is developed to determine optimal advertising expenditures as a function of product maturity and past advertising. Random demand for the product depends upon an aggregate measure of current and past advertising called goodwill, and the position of the product in its life cycle measured by sales-to-date. Conditions on the parameters of the model are established that insure that it is optimal to advertise less as the product matures. Additional characteristics of the optimal advertising policy are also established.

## 10. Optimal Sequential Investment Decisions Under Conditions of Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Gregory P. Prastacos
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1983
### Abstract:
This paper presents a mathematical model of sequential investment behavior under conditions of uncertainty. The model addresses the problem of an investor with access to a limited pool of capital, who makes sequential decisions on long-lasting investments, under uncertainty as to the timing or the quality of future opportunities. We derive optimal investment strategies for the cases where the return from investment is a convex or concave function, we present closed form solutions for commonly adopted return functions, and we evaluate how the optimal investment behavior should change when changes occur in the environment, or the underlying probability distributions. In addition, we analyze three modifications of the problem.

## 11. Estimating and Adjusting for the Intervalling-Effect Bias in Beta

### Abstract:
The concept of beta as the measure of systematic risk has been widely accepted in the academic and financial community. Increasingly, betas are being used to estimate the cost of capital for corporations. Despite this, however, biases are generally present in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of beta. In particular, empirical estimates of beta are affected by friction in the trading process which delays the adjustment of a security's price to informational change and hence leads to an intervalling-effect bias. In this paper, we present and empirically test two procedures for correcting this bias. The first is to estimate the asymptotic value that OLS beta approaches as the differencing interval is lengthened without bound. The second procedure is to infer the value of beta by adjusting OLS beta for cross-sectional differences in the intervalling effect as a function of the depth of the market for a security (as measured by its value of shares outstanding). Our results suggest that a substantial correction is needed to get true beta estimates from short differencing interval data.
