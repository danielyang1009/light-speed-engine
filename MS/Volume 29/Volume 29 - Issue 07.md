## 1. Business Unit Strategy and Changes in the Product R&D Budget

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
This study of changes in Product R&D intensity in business units supplements past studies by including two major classes of independent variables which have not been examined previously: the competitive strategy of the business and role of the business in the overall corporate portfolio. Multiple regression analysis is used on a sample drawn from the PIMS data base. The results suggest that R&D decisions in growth businesses are responsive to competition, evolving strategies, and intra-firm resource flows. In mature businesses, a pattern of stability and R&D equilibrium is evident, even in the face of changes by competitors. Managerial implications are noted.

## 2. The Correlates of Entrepreneurship in Three Types of Firms
### Author(s):
- Danny Miller
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
The objective of the research was to discover the chief determinants of entrepreneurship, the process by which organizations renew themselves and their markets by pioneering, innovation, and risk taking. Some authors have argued that personality factors of the leader are what determine entrepreneurship, others have highlighted the role played by the structure of the organization, while a final group have pointed to the importance of strategy making. We believed that the manner and extent to which entrepreneurship would be influenced by all of these factors would in large measure depend upon the nature of the organization. Based upon the work of a number of authors we derived a crude typology of firms: Simple firms are small and their power is centralized at the top. Planning firms are bigger, their goal being smooth and efficient operation through the use of formal controls and plans. Organic firms strive to be adaptive to their environments, emphasizing expertise-based power and open communications. The predictiveness of the typology was established upon a sample of 52 firms using hypothesis-testing and analysis of variance techniques. We conjectured that in Simple firms entrepreneurship would be determined by the characteristics of the leader; in Planning firms it would be facilitated by explicit and well integrated product-market strategies, and in Organic firms it would be a function of environment and structure. These hypotheses were largely borne out by correlational and multiple regression analyses. Any programs which aim to stimulate entrepreneurship would benefit greatly from tailoring recommendations to the nature of the target firms.

## 3. The Optimal Selection of Small Portfolios

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
Portfolios that are risk-return efficient in the sense of Markowitz sometimes contain too many securities to be attractive to the small investor. An optimal portfolio subject to a size constraint can be found by an implicit enumeration algorithm, that is much faster than a previous approach and moreover allows the inclusion of securities whose -coefficient is negative. A simple and computationally very efficient heuristic method that almost always produces optimal portfolios is described as well.

## 4. The Effect of Workload Dependent Due-Dates on Job Shop Performance
### Author(s):
- J. W. M. Bertrand
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
This study explores the due-date performance of job shop control systems which base job due dates on a time-phased representation of the workload and the machine capacity in the shop. The performance is measured by the mean and the standard deviation of the lateness. Two parameters are used to vary the functioning of the due-date assignment system: a minimum allowance for waiting, denoted by SL, and a maximum fraction of the available capacity allowed for loading, denoted by CLL. The system increases the waiting lime allowance if congestion is observed when loading a new job. The capability of the system to observe congestion is determined by the parameters CLL and SL.

## 5. Assembly Line Balancing with Processing Alternatives: An Application
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
The conventional approach to the assembly line balancing problem assumes that the manufacturing methods to be used have been predetermined. However, in practice the design engineer has several alternatives available in the choice of processing, typically involving a trade-off between labor or capital intensive options. The choice of manufacturing method is frequently viewed as an investment or capital budgeting decision, contrasting projected savings in labor cost with the additional fixed cost for the more capital intensive alternatives. The manufacturing tasks (based on the selected processing alternatives) are then assigned to work stations so as to minimize the number of work stations (i.e., labor costs) necessary to achieve a desired production rate.

## 6. Individual versus Social Optimization in the Allocation of Customers to Alternative Servers
### Author(s):
- Colin E. Bell
- Shaler Stidham, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
Customers arrive at a service area according to a Poisson process. An arriving customer must choose one of K servers without observing present congestion levels. The only available information about the kth server is the service time distribution (with expected duration k1) and the cost per unit time of waiting at the kth server (hk). Although service distributions may differ from server to server and need not be exponential, it is assumed that they share the same coefficient of variation. Individuals acting in self-interest induce an arrival rate pattern (1, 2, , k).

## 7. Bivariate Negotiations as a Problem of Stochastic Terminal Control
### Author(s):
- Francoise Fogelman-Soulie
- Bertrand Munier
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is developed for two players negotiating on two negotiation (operational goal) dimensions. Bivanate utilities are not assumed. Rather at any stage the payoff is expressed as a payoff probability distribution stating the probability of a player obtaining various amounts of each of the two variables. The preferred (optimum) payoff distribution is not fixed but changes in the course of negotiations. The model treats concession making as a problem of stochastic terminal control which can be formulated and solved by dynamic programming to yield normative recommendations as to concession making (control). The model is illustrated by numerical example. The present research generalizes work by Rao and Shakun (Rao, A. G., M. F. Shaxun. 1974. A normative model for negotiations. Management Sci.20 (10, June).) on a single negotiation variable. It models mathematically in the two-player, two-dimensional case negotiation aspects of a general approach to conflict resolution and design of purposeful systems discussed by Shakun (Shakun, M. F. 1981. Formalizing conflict resolution in policy making. Internal. J. Gen. Systems7 (3); Shakun, M. F. 1981. Policy making and meaning as design of purposeful systems. Internal J. Gen. Systems7 (4).).

## 8. Achieving a Confidence Interval for Parameters Estimated by Simulation
### Author(s):
- Nabil R. Adam
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1983
### Abstract:
This paper presents a procedure for determining the number of simulation observations required to achieve a preassigned confidence interval for means estimated by simulation. This procedure, which is simple to implement and efficient to use, is compared with two other methods for determining the required sample size in a simulation run. The empirical results show that this procedure gives good results in the precision of estimated means and in sample size requirement.
