## 1. Formulation and Solution of Nonlinear Integer Production Planning Problems for Flexible Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- Kathryn E. Stecke
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is an integrated, computer-controlled complex of automated material handling devices and numerically controlled machine tools that can simultaneously process medium-sized volumes of a variety of part types. FMSs are becoming an attractive substitute for the conventional means of batch manufacturing, especially in the metal-cutting industry. This new production technology has been designed to attain the efficiency of well-balanced, machine-paced transfer lines, while utilizing the flexibility that job shops have to simultaneously machine multiple part types. Some properties and constraints of these systems are similar to those of flow and job shops, while others are different. This technology creates the need to develop new and appropriate planning and control procedures that take advantage of the system's capabilities for higher production rates.

## 2. The Budget-Limit Effect on the Delegation of the Capital Budgeting Authority: The Case of Sequential and Frequent Investment Decisions
### Author(s):
- Ed M. Sharon
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
Publishing houses, Savings & Loans and other business firms make frequent long-term investment decisions, and in sequence. Typically they encounter more short-lived investment opportunities than their budget can accommodate. Some will even go out of their way to broaden their horizon of choices. As a result, one will find some organizations which satisfy their needs by choosing opportunities from a relatively narrow horizon, and others which are engaged in an extensive evaluation process whose objective is to gradually narrow down the options available. The latter effort typically covers various layers in the organizations, both at the division (branch) and headquarters (HQ).

## 3. Discounting of Life-Saving and Other Nonmonetary Effects
### Author(s):
- Emmett B. Keeler

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
Cost-effectiveness analysts generally assume that preferences over time are such that streams of monetary and nonmonetary program effects can be reduced to one discounted sum of monetary costs and another of effects. It is known that if the nonmonetary effects can be cashed out in a way that does not vary with time, then the rates of discount for monetary and nonmonetary effects have to be equal. This paper presents a more compelling argument for the equality of those rates when hard to monetize benefits such as life-saving are involved. It shows that if the ability to produce the nonmonetary effect does not diminish too quickly over time, failure to discount benefits implies that programs are always improved by delay. In general, discounting benefits and costs at different rates can lead to peculiar results.

## 4. An Optimization Model for Production Costing in Electric Utilities
### Author(s):
- J. C. Ammons
- L. F. McGinnis
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
Estimating the annual production cost is a crucial component in long range capacity planning for electric utilities. Traditional simulation-based methods are quite expensive in terms of computer resources (space and time), while simpler mathematical programming-based models generally assume a linear variable production cost. This paper presents a method that incorporates quadratic production costs for each unit and uses optimization submodels to develop a system production cost versus output curve. The method is tested using data from a large southeastern utility. Production cost estimates within one percent of the estimates from a large simulation model were obtained with a small fraction of the simulation model's computing time. The concluding section discusses how the new method might be incorporated in procedures for capacity planning.

## 5. A Fuzzy Set Approach to Aggregating Internal Control Judgments
### Author(s):
- John W. Cooley
- James O. Hicks, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
Internal control evaluation traditionally has been an integral part of an audit to provide an opinion on an entity's financial statements. Essentially, internal control evaluation is used to determine the substantive testing necessary to render an opinion on the financial statements. With the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and recent proposals of the SEC, internal control evaluation has gained new impetus. These events may lead to the independent auditor being required to provide an internal control opinion separate from a financial statement audit. Consequently, the auditor may be required to aggregate the evaluation of system parts into a statement as to the performance of the system or major subsystem as a whole in addition to the reports currently made to management on the adequacy of internal control. Although mathematical models for internal control evaluation have been proposed, these have failed to receive acceptance by auditors. As an alternative to these models, this paper proposes the use of a procedure for aggregating the evaluation of parts of an internal control system employing the linguistic values commonly in use by auditors such as strong, weak, and adequate. The linguistic model (1) uses the theory of fuzzy sets to aggregate these common linguistic values and (2) returns a linguistic aggregate evaluation of the control system under review. A cash receipts and shipping control system is used in a numerical illustration and future research directions are proposed.

## 6. Sequential Analysis of the Stay/Leave Decision: U.S. Air Force Officers
### Author(s):
- Glenn A. Gotz
- John J. McCall
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model to study the stay/leave decisions of Air Force officers. The model includes the most important institutional factors affecting an officer's career: promotion probabilities and timing, regular force integration probabilities, and mandatory separation and retirement probabilities. The model considers the officer's income for each potential combination of future grade and year of service and his civilian income opportunities. The model studies the incentives to retire for the current nondisability retirement system and the recent proposal by the President's Commission on Military Compensation. Numerical results are presented using actual data from Fiscal Year 1970 for nonrated officers who entered the Air Force through ROTC. On average, the officers' stay/leave behavior conforms with the model's predictions.

## 7. Discrete Approximations of Probability Distributions
### Author(s):
- Allen C. Miller, III
- Thomas R. Rice
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
Practical limits on the size of most probabilistic models require that probability distributions be approximated by a few representative values and associated probabilities. This paper demonstrates that methods commonly used to determine discrete approximations of probability distributions systematically underestimate the moments of the original distribution. A new procedure based on gaussian quadrature is developed in this paper. It can be used to decrease the error in the approximation to any desired level.

### Author(s):
- Robert E. Quinn
- John Rohrbaugh
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
This paper presents a framework for organizational analysis. The empirically derived approach does not emerge from the observation of actual organizations, but from the ordering, through multivariate techniques, of criteria that organizational theorists and researchers use to evaluate the performance of organizations.

## 9. NoteModelling the Effect of Decreased Food Intake on the Activity Pattern of an Individual
### Author(s):
- Robin D. Gorsky
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
The effect of decreases in food energy intake on the activity pattern of an individual may be described by an Mx/M/1 queueing model.  represents the rate of activity arrival to the system. E(k) represents the average energy level at which the system performs,  represents the rate at which the system processes energy units. p0 = 1  E(k)/ represents the probability of an idle system, of the system at rest. The model was validated by collecting data on food energy intake and activities from ten healthy young men. When food energy intake decreased an average of 500 kcal/day, 1  p0, the probability of a nonidle system, decreased from 0.431 to 0.413, p < 0.005. The greatest parameter change occurred in , which decreased from 0.245 to 0.235, p < 0.001. Thus, when food energy intake decreases, the activity pattern of an individual as represented by a queueing system changes: more time is spent at rest; less time is spent in moving activities.

## 10. NoteA Note on Efficiency of the Antithetic Variate Method for Simulating Stochastic Networks
### Author(s):
- Floyd H. Grant, III
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
In a recent paper by Sullivan, Hayya, and Schaul (Sullivan, R. S., J. C. Hayya, R. Schaul. 1982. Efficiency of the antithetic variate method for simulating stochastic networks. Management Sci.28 (5, May) 563572.), they present a theorem which proves that negative covariance will be guaranteed, and thus a variance reduction achieved, when estimating the project completion time in PERT networks using antithetic sampling procedures. Their proof is restricted to stochastic networks in which the arc time distributions are symmetric about their means. In this note we present a proof which guarantees a variance reduction for arbitrary arc time distributions.

## 11. NoteOn Baluts Algorithm and NP-Completeness for a Chance-Constrained Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Hiroshi Kise
- Toshihide Ibaraki
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1983
### Abstract:
In 1973, Balut gave an algorithm to solve an n-job one machine scheduling problem in which processing times are random variables and the objective is to minimize the number of tardy jobs with a specified certainty level. This note, however, presents an example for which his algorithm fails to give an optimal schedule. Furthermore, there does not seem to exist any such efficient algorithm because the problem can be shown to be NP-complete.
