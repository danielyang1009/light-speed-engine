## 1. After the Crash: The Passenger Response to the DC-10 Disaster
### Author(s):
- Arnold Barnett
- Anthony J. Lofaso
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
Through the analysis of CAB market-share data, an attempt is made to estimate the extent to which fears arising from the Chicago DC-10 crash displaced passenger traffic onto other kinds of aircraft. Factors that could distort simple before-after comparisons are discussed and a procedure to correct for them is proposed. The results suggest that, less than a year after the accident, there was no detectable resistance to flying the DC-10.

## 2. Sales Territory Alignment: A Review and Model
### Author(s):
- Andris A. Zoltners

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
The sales territory alignment problem may be viewed as the problem of grouping small geographic sales coverage units into larger geographic clusters called sales territories in a way that the sales territories are acceptable according to managerially relevant alignment criteria. This paper first reviews sales territory alignment models which have appeared in the marketing literature. A framework for sales territory alignment and several properties of a good sales territory alignment are developed in the course of the review. A general sales territory alignment model which accommodates these properties is developed. A solution procedure for the general model is presented. Finally, an actual implementation of the general model is described. The implementation provides a comparison of the general model with a similar model which has been frequently cited in the marketing literature.

## 3. Comparison of Alternative Utility Functions in Portfolio Selection Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
This paper examines the effect of alternative utility functions and parameter values on the optimal composition of a risky investment portfolio. Normally distributed assets are the setting for the theoretical and empirical analyses. The results agree well with the available theory and imply utility functions and parameter values that are appropriate for investors with particular risk-bearing attitudes. The results give strong empirical support to the proposition that utility functions having different functional forms and parameter values but similar absolute risk aversion indices have similar optimal portfolios. These results suggest that over horizons up to one year one can safely substitute convenient surrogate utility functions for other utility functions, for reasons of tractability or otherwise. The results also provide guidance regarding the significance of the magnitude and change of particular numerical values of the risk aversion index. Moreover, theoretical (exact) results are obtained using Rubinstein's measure of global risk aversion.

## 4. An Approach to the Optimal Positioning of a New Product
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
This study examines the problem faced by a firm which wishes to position a new choice object in an existing product class. It is assumed that both the consumer and the firm are involved in a two-stage decision process. The consumer first decides on his budget for the product class. He then evaluates, within the product class, that subset of competing objects which have prices approximately equal to his budget constraint. This evaluation is performed through a weighted multi-attribute utility model. The product classes considered here are ones for which the consumer has a finite ideal level on each attribute. The consumer is hypothesized to choose, without error, that object which is closest to his ideal. Different individuals are assumed to be heterogeneous in both attribute weights and ideal levels. The firm is assumed to first identify, in the attribute space which contains ideal points and competing objects, promising product positions which would attract a large number of consumers. It then evaluates these positions in terms of costs and resulting profits. The problem of identifying the promising positions, given information on a sample of individuals, is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program. Due to the inability of such a program to solve even small sample problems, the spatial properties of the problem are examined. An exact solution algorithm which is computationally feasible for small samples is developed. It is based on an examination of intersections of indifference hyperellipsoids. For larger sample problems an efficient heuristic which is an extension of the random point search used in nonlinear programming is provided. It involves random line search procedures for our noncontinuous-type problem. The positioning approach and the heuristic are illustrated in a simulated positioning problem in the small car market.

## 5. A Numerical Method to Obtain the Equilibrium Results for the Multiple Finite Source Priority Queueing Model
### Author(s):
- M. Jeya Chandra
- Robert G. Sargent
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
In this paper a numerical method is presented to obtain the equilibrium results of the multiple finite source queueing model having a single server using a nonpreemptive fixed priority service discipline and where each class of customers has a different exponential interarrival density function and arbitrary service time distribution function. This solution method uses the method of imbedded Markov Chain and the renewal reward theorem to find the proportion of time the server is busy with the customers of different classes. The equilibrium results are then related to these proportions using an extension of Little's formula.

## 6. A Branch and Bound Algorithm for Assembly Line Balancing Problems with Formulation Irregularities
### Author(s):
- Roger V. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
This paper describes a branch and bound algorithm which can solve assembly line balancing probems with nine modifications to the originally formulated problem of minimizing the required number of assembly stations, given a cycle time, a set of tasks with given deterministic performance times, and between-task precedence relationships. The first two formulation modifications are those of permitting planned imbalance in the total of task performance times at each assembly station, and allowing specific tasks to be assigned to specific types of assembly stations. Seven further problem modifications can be solved by the proposed algorithm, or by any algorithm or heuristic that can solve problems containing these first two modifications. They are: treatment of stochastic task performance times on unpaced lines; requirement of particular tasks to be assigned to particular stations; requirement of task groupings according to task skill levels; requirement of particular tasks to be assigned to only a left-of-line or right-of line station; required task separations; some mixed model situations; and where paralleling of a specified task into two (or more stations) is permitted. The algorithm is presented in both conceptual and detailed form. Computer computation times to solve a selected cross-sectional sample of problems are provided.

## 7. A Recursive Kalman Filter Forecasting Approach
### Author(s):
- Douglas R. Kahl
- Johannes Ledolter
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
This paper examines the forecasting accuracy and the cost effectiveness of time series models with time-varying coefficients. A simulation study investigates the potential forecasting benefits of a proposed Kalman filter type adaptive estimation and forecasting approach. It is found that:
When appropriate, the time-varying coefficient approach leads to better forecasts than the constant coefficient procedures.
A simple decision rule, which indicates whether time-varying coefficient models are in fact needed, increases the computational efficiency.

## 8. NoteOn Choosing Between Rev. Bayes and Prof. Von Neumann
### Author(s):
- James P. Kahan
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1983
### Abstract:
In a recent issue of Management Science, Kadane and Larkey [10], [11] debated with Harsanyi [8], [9] on the relative merits of strategic policies derived from game theoretic vs. Bayesian decision-theoretic orientations. While the fact that the two orientations are virtually first cousins gives a Middle Eastern flavor to the discussion, just as the problems of that unfortunate spot on the globe, the two orientations have substantive differences that should be attended to by people faced with managerial decision problems modelled as games.

## 10. NoteModeling Semirational Competitive Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Management Science recently printed an exchange of views between Kadane and Larkey (Kadane, J. B., P. D. Larkey. 1982. Subjective probability and the theory of games. Management Sci.28 113120; Kadane, J. B., P. D. Larkey. 1982. Reply to Professor Harsanyi. Management Sci.28 124.) and Harsanyi (Harsanyi, J. C. 1982. Subjective probability and the theory of games: comments on Kadane and Larkey's paper. Management Sci.28 120124; Harsanyi, J. C. 1982. Rejoinder to Professors Kadane and Larkey. Management Sci.28 124125.) on the relative usefulness of game theory and decision theory for analyzing decisions in competitive situations. This note comments on some of the arguments used in that exchange with particular emphasis on bidding theory. It then proposes the development of models in which both rational analysis of a model of the competitive situation as well as other factors influence the competitors. Two such models are described.
