## 1. Constructing a Complex Judgmental Model: An Index of Trauma Severity
### Author(s):
- Dennis G. Fryback

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
The modeling of many complex phenomena necessarily relies on numerous interrelated judgments. This paper illustrates an application of the concepts of multiattribute utility assessment, based on the professional judgments of one physician, to scale the trauma severity of injuries to individuals. Special attention is given to problems not usually present or reported in applications of the assessment techniques. These include nonmonotonic functions, strong dependencies among different measures, and the state dependence of trauma severity on age and existing diseases of the individual. The manner in which these complexities were addressed is indicated.

## 2. Supply, Storage, and Service Reliability Decisions by Gas Distribution Utilities: A Chance-Constrained Approach
### Author(s):
- Jean-Michel Guldmann
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
This paper explores the trade-offs among purchases, storage, and service reliability decisions faced by natural gas distribution utilities. The short-term demand for natural gas fluctuates because of the weather. To encourage load leveling, the pipeline transmission companies that supply the utilities use a demand contract that charges utilities based on their peak day needs and often charge for a minimum daily purchase requirement whether that purchase is made or not. The policy variables available to the utility include increasing its storage capacity and providing interruptible service to some customers thereby lowering reliability of service. There are also technological constraints on the maximum storage gas flows.

## 3. Supply, Storage, and Service Reliability Decisions by Gas Distribution Utilities: A Chance-Constrained Approach: Comments on Guldmann's Paper
### Author(s):
- Jill J. Rasmussen
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
A question has been raised as to the value of Guldmann's paper because the model application indicates very small increments of benefits over costs for the optimal decision across a wide range of nonoptimal ones. That is, no matter what decision is made about storage capacity or reliability level, savings are on the order of 1 percent of costs. In addition, similar increments of benefit occur irrespective of conversion capacity or reliability level.

## 4. An Injury Threshold Model for Two-Car Collisions
### Author(s):
- K. S. Krishnan
- James V. Carnahan
- Martin J. Beckmann
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
A theoretical model which estimates the probability of injury to occupants of vehicles in two-car collisions is presented and evaluated. This model is based on considerations of principles from mechanics and observations from biomechanics. It is evaluated using two-car accident injury data.

## 5. Equilibrium Strategies for Final-Offer Arbitration: There is no Median Convergence
### Author(s):

- Samuel Merrill, III
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
Final-offer arbitration is a procedure for settling disputes between two parties in which an arbitrator chooses the final offer of the party closest to what he considers a fair settlement. This procedure is modeled as a two-person, zero-sum game of imperfect information, in which the parties are assumed to know the probability distribution of the arbitrator's fair settlements and to make bids in an infinite strategy space that maximize their expected payoffs. Necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be local and global equilibria in pure strategies are derived, and necessary conditions for mixed strategies in a particular case are found. Such equilibria, when they exist in pure strategies, represent bids which are symmetric about the median and, for most common distributions, are separated from one another by two or more standard deviations. This finding suggests that final-offer arbitration may not accomplish its avowed purpose of inducing the two parties to converge on what they perceive to be the arbitrator's median fair settlement.

## 6. Simple Approaches to Shift, Days-Off and Tour Scheduling Problems
### Author(s):
- James G. Morris
- Michael J. Showalter
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
Shift and days-off scheduling problems have received much attention in the literature of integer programming approaches to workforce scheduling. A typical managerial use would be to schedule full-time employees to minimize the number of labor hours while satisfying variable workforce requirements of a service delivery system. We present computational experience to show that an easily implemented application of linear programming frequently produces optimal solutions to these problems.

## 7. Manufacturing Technology in the 1980's: A Survey of Federal Programs and Practices
### Author(s):
- William A. Hetzner
- Louis G. Tornatzky
- Katherine J. Klein
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
This study describes the U.S. government's role in the development of manufacturing technologies and in the transfer of manufacturing innovations to private industry. The goals, organization, technologies, methods of technology transfer, user groups, and methods of program assessment for 13 government programs in this area are described and their implications for national manufacturing innovation and productivity are discussed.

## 8. The Practice of Management Science in R&D Project Management
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Liberatore
- George J. Titus
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
The results of an empirical study on the current usage of quantitative techniques for R&D project management in Fortune 500 industrial firms are presented. A nonrandom sample of 40 respondents from 29 firms were selected to represent a mix of industrial sectors and geographic regions. The information was obtained via personal interview of R&D budget heads and some high level staff. Extensive demographic data on the respondent and his company were collected and related to familiarity and usage of project management techniques. Data were also collected on the perceived impact of techniques on project decision making, and any recent/planned changes in the cadre of techniques. Heavy use and high perceived impact of financial methods for project selection, selective use of network models, some dissatisfaction over the methods available for project scheduling and control, and no usage of mathematical programming models for R&D resource allocation were key findings. As a result, R&D managers must have a thorough understanding of the capital budgeting techniques used by their organizations. Also, the initial training for R&D managers in project management should provide a broad-based introduction to the available methods and techniques, while emphasizing organizational fit considerations. Finally, it is suggested that R&D managers enlist the support of management scientists in the development of decision support systems for R&D project management, especially for multi-project planning and control.

## 9. NoteMintzberg was Right!: A Replication and Extension of The Nature of Managerial Work
### Author(s):
- Lance B. Kurke
- Howard E. Aldrich
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1983
### Abstract:
This paper reports a replication of Mintzberg (McCall M. W., Jr. A. M. Morrison, R. L. Hannan. 1978. Studies of managerial work: results and methods. Technical Report #9, Center for Creative Leadership.). Structured observation with supplemental unstructured interviewing was used to study four top managers for one week each. Mintzberg's field study was supported by our replication in all important dimensions. Explanations for similarities and differences between organizations and industries are briefly discussed.
