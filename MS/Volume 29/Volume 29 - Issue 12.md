## 1. Corporate Entrepreneurship and Strategic Management: Insights from a Process Study
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Burgelman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model of the strategic process concerning entrepreneurial activity in large, complex organizations. Previous empirical and theoretical findings can be integrated in this new conceptual framework.

## 2. The Confusion of Is and Ought in Game Theoretic Contexts
### Author(s):
- Joseph B. Kadane
- Patrick D. Larkey
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
This paper explores the distinction between normative and positive theoretical statements in a game theoretic context from a Bayesian perspective. Normative and positive theoretical statements are often confused in decision making research. The confusion results from some unique epistemological and methodological problems associated with cognitive behavior as an object for scientific inquiry. The confusion persists because of poor model validation procedures which are themselves further complicated by the confusion. The confusion greatly impedes the development of more useful prescriptions for and predictions of human decision behavior. From a Bayesian perspective which acknowledges the importance of incomplete information and imperfect theories of behavior, the confusion is unnecessary.

## 4. Ranking in Tournaments and Group Decisionmaking
### Author(s):
- Stephen T. Goddard
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
This paper fully discusses methods for ranking a set of alternatives in the fairest possible way according to a minimum violations criterion. New methods, based on finding paths and circuits in graphs, are presented for ranking participants in round-robin and generalized tournaments, and for consensus and group decisionmaking problems. The objective of the paper is to review existing methods for tackling these problems, and compare them with the new methods, according to a fairness criterion, and the amount of computing required to reach a solution. It is shown that the new methods often exceed the existing methods in both fairness and reduced computing requirements. In particular, the new methods are generally more versatile than existing methods. This allows organizations to obtain the fairest ranking of a number of alternatives, according to their managers' or employees' wishes. Particular attention is given to incomplete rankings where insufficient exposure of an individual to some alternatives restricts that individual to ranking only the remaining alternatives.

## 5. Conjoint Analysis: A Comparative Analysis of Specification Tests for the Utility Function
### Author(s):
- Marcel L. Corstjens
- David A. Gautschi
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
The focus of this paper is on determining appropriate combination rules for idiosyncratic ordinal utility functions in conjoint measurement. An axiomatic diagnosis is used which is based on explanatory criteria rather than goodness-of-fit or predictive criteria. Experimental results are presented comparing the selection of combination rules based on axiomatic tests and empirical fitting procedures for additive (x + y + z) and distributive (x(y + z)) combinations of three factors. A number of conflicting diagnoses result from the simultaneous applications of axiomatic tests and goodness-of-fit criteria, suggesting the importance of testing certain necessary conditions for simple polynomial combination rules, such as additive and distributive rules. Because the axiomatic approach is effective in rejecting inappropriate functional forms, we argue that it should complement rather than replace the empirical fitting diagnostic approaches.

## 6. Techniques for Facilities Layout: Deciding which Pairs of Activities Should be Adjacent
### Author(s):
- L. R. Foulds
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
This paper surveys work done to date on the problem of laying out the facilities of some system in terms of specifying which activities are to be adjacent. Each pair of facilities has a closeness rating which represents the desirability that they are located adjacently. Ratings are usually proportional to the flow of goods or people between facilities. The aim of the layout analyst is to design a system so that the sum of the ratings of adjacent pairs is maximized as this represents travel saved. This paper formulates the layout problem and reviews exact and heuristic methods of solution. In the literature review special emphasis is placed on the newly-emerging graph-theoretic techniques which appear promising.

## 7. Aggregation in Manpower Planning
### Author(s):
- J. Wijngaard
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
In manpower planning, as in all other kinds of planning, an important choice is the level of aggregation. The proper level of aggregation depends on the flexibility (mobility) of the personnel. This dependency is investigated in this paper. The manpower system considered is characterized by two dimensions, level and function group. Conditions are derived for aggregate long-term planning (aggregation over function group) combined with one-period disaggregation being optimal.

## 8. NoteOptimal Long-Run Equilibrium Advertising Level for the Blattberg-Jeuland Model
### Author(s):
- Suresh P. Sethi
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
The purpose of this note is to formulate and solve a dynamic optimization problem based on the Blattberg-Jeuland advertising model. Also examined is the behavior of the optimal long-run equilibrium level of advertising with respect to changes in some important parameters of the problem. In particular, a new interesting result, showing that the equilibrium optimal level of advertising for the B-J model is a nonmonotone function of the rate of decay parameter, is derived. That is, the equilibrium optimal level of advertising is an increasing function of the rate of decay for smaller rates of decay and a decreasing function for larger rates of decay than a critical rate of decay. This phenomenon is analogous to a sink effect and is intuitively appealing. It is also shown that the equilibrium optimal level of advertising is a decreasing function of the insertion cost and discount rate parameters. Finally, the framework presented in this note is also useful in analyzing further extensions of the problem solved here.

## 9. An Algorithm for Multiobjective Zero-One Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Glseren Kiziltan
- Erkut Yucaolu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1983
### Abstract:
A branch and bound algorithm is presented which is based on the extension of implicit enumeration techniques to multiobjective zero-one linear programming and which appears to be computationally quite efficient. Domination tests, aiming at identifying paths of the enumeration tree that lead to dominated solutions as high up the tree as possible, are developed. Some computational results are also given.
