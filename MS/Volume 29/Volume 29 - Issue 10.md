## 1. A Study of Economists' Consensus Forecasts
### Author(s):
- David Ahlers
- Josef Lakonishok
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
This study examines the ability of economists to forecast ten major economic series. The data for this study were provided by J. A. Livingston of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who since 1947 has collected forecasts for the upcoming 6 and 12 months. The results reveal that, in general, for the period from 1947 through 1978, the economists in Livingston's sample did not produce efficient forecasts and were not able to outperform simple statistical models. It should be noted, however, that a substantial and consistent improvement in forecasting performance by economists in Livingston's sample did occur over this same period. These results contain important information for managers who use macro-economic consensus forecasts.

## 2. Mathematical Programming Approaches to Capacity-Constrained MRP Systems: Review, Formulation and Problem Reduction
### Author(s):
- Peter J. Billington
- John O. McClain
- L. Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a line of research on capacity-constrained multi-stage production scheduling problems. The first section introduces the problem area as it arises from a failure of MRP systems. Then a review of the literature and an analysis of the type of problems that exist are presented in 2. Section 3 outlines linear and mixed integer-linear programming formulations. These formulations compute the required production lead times according to the demands on available capacity, thereby reducing in-process inventory compared to the usual practice in MRP. A discussion of how to use the LP version is included. However, the size of the problems in practice implies that more efficient solution techniques must be found. The final topic of this paper, Product Structure Compression, is introduced as a method to reduce the size of the problem without losing optimality.

## 3. Methods for the Evaluation of Permutations as Strategies in Stochastic Scheduling Problems
### Author(s):
- K. D. Glazebrook
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
A collection of stochastic jobs is to be processed by a single machine in a manner which is consistent with a precedence relation on the job set. Costs are incurred as jobs are processed and rewards are earned when they complete. The problem of finding optimal processing strategies is in general very complex. However, algorithms exist which in many cases yield the strategies which are optimal among those which are simply permutations of the job set. In light of this, the question of how well permutations perform as strategies is an important one. We present methods which aim to answer this question. They are based on earlier results by Glazebrook.

## 4. Risk Premiums for Decision Regret
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
Some people find decision making under uncertainty difficult because they fear making the wrong decision, wrong in the sense that the outcome of their chosen alternative proves to be worse than could have been achieved with another alternative. These people may be willing to pay a premium to avoid consequences that produce this decision regret. This paper continues an earlier investigation into the normative implications of decision regret and looks at situations where the joint probability distribution of consequences between alternatives is not specified at the time of the decision. It includes a discussion of cases where the outcomes produced by alternatives not chosen are never resolved. A consequence of this model of preferences for risky situations is that two components of risk aversion may be identified, decreasing marginal value and regret aversion.

## 5. An Econometric Study of Recruitment Marketing in the U.S. Navy
### Author(s):
- Dominique M. Hanssens
- Henry A. Levien
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
Since the abolishment of the mandatory draft the U.S. Navy, along with the other services, has engaged in aggressive marketing strategies in order to attract a sufficient number of qualified individuals to volunteer enlistment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of these efforts, primarily advertising and personal selling, within the general framework of the recruiting environment.

## 6. The Evolution of Organizational Structure and Technology in a Developing Country
### Author(s):
- Linsu Kim
- James M. Utterback
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
This article examines an evolutionary pattern of relationships among technology, structure, environment and other contextual variables in 31 manufacturing organizations in a developing country. The results of bivariate analyses show that younger firms exhibit more mechanistic structure, a higher degree in operations technology adaptability, a lower degree in indigenous technical capability, a lower degree of innovation, and smaller scale than older firms. The results also show that younger firms perceive suppliers as more important, while older firms perceive customers and competitors as more important. Multivariate discriminant analysis also supports the above findings in general. The pattern observed in a developing country is quite different from that observed in developed countries, but firms in both developed and developing countries appear to adopt organizational designs viable to their own environment. The results of the study suggest ways in which international operations should be designed to correspond to their local environment.

## 7. A Fluid Flow Model of Networks of Queues
### Author(s):
- James S. Vandergraft
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
This paper describes a new technique for modeling flow through a network of queues. The advantages of this method over many discrete event simulations or queueing theory techniques include simplicity, low cost and portability. The paper describes the kinds of processes to which the technique can be applied, and the characteristics of the process that can be determined by the resulting model. An example of claims processing in a Social Security Administration's District Office is given. The basis for the technique is to model the information flow by a fluid flow, and then use standard engineering ideas to describe the fluid flow by a system of ordinary differential equations. The system of equations is solved by well-known numerical methods.

## 8. Identifying Redundant Constraints and Implicit Equalities in Systems of Linear Constraints
### Author(s):
- Jan Telgen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1983
### Abstract:
Redundant constraints are constraints that can be omitted from a system of linear constraints without changing the feasible region. Implicit equalities are inequality constraints that can be replaced by equalities without changing the feasible region. We prove some theorems concerning the identification of both kinds of constraints. Based on these theorems two methods are developed that allow identification of all redundant constraints and all implicit equalities. Computational experience on small problems indicates a behavior at least competitive with other methods in this field.
