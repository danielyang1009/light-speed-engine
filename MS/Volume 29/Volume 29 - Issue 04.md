## 1. Untold Horrors of the Waiting Room: What the Equilibrium Distribution Will Never Tell About the Queue-Length Process
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
This paper cautions against using only the equilibrium distribution to describe the behavior of a queue. It is suggested that fluctuations in the queue-length process should also be described, for example, by various first-passage-time distributions. The range of possible fluctuations associated with a given equilibrium queue-length distribution is described for the GI/M/1 queue. The theory of complete Tchebycheff systems in Karlin and Studden [Karlin, S., W. J. Studden. 1966. Tchebycheff systems: with applications in analysis and statistics. John Wiley and Sons, New York.] is applied to construct appropriate extremal distributions, i.e., interarrival-time distributions having the given equilibrium queue-length distribution and maximum or minimum values of fluctuation measures such as the relaxation time.

## 2. Filtering: An Approach to Generating the Information Base for Collective Choice
### Author(s):
- George Abonyi
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
Nonmarket resource allocation decisions require some means for generating information on relevant preferences. This is part of the role of a collective choice process. Implicit in the optimization techniques central to MS/OR is the assumption that makes collective choice equivalent to the optimization of a social preference function. This paper proposes an alternative approach to collective choice, called filtering, and compares it with the general optimization approach. Though not foreclosing the use of optimization techniques, filtering represents a fundamental departure from the perspective on collective choice implicit in these techniques. The fundamental advantage of filtering is that it increases the likelihood of collective agreement on specific plans, while minimizing the strategic use of misinformation. The general logic of filtering may be implemented via a variety of interactive methods. The information generated can contribute to more stable and implementable plans. Filtering responds to a societal context characterized more by diversity of interests than uniformity, and as much concerned with the possible adverse consequences of plans proposed by experts as with their promised benefits. The more modest objective of collective choice supported by filtering is to identify collectively acceptable plans for interdependent social groups whose goals and preferences may not be fully known. This supports the need for participation by relevant interests in the planning process. In general, filtering provides a framework for joint charting of the future collaboratively, by aiming at the evolution of a reasonable consensus from a base of what may appear initially to be unreasonable vetoes.

## 3. An Algorithm to Calculate the Return Distribution of Portfolios with Option Positions
### Author(s):
- Richard Bookstaber
- Roger Clarke
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
The use of options in altering the return distribution of stock portfolios has found increasing interest among investment managers. The potential of options in forming portfolio return distributions that are more consistent with investor preferences has been well developed, but determining the actual effect of options on portfolio returns remains a complex and unsolved problem. The purpose of this paper is to describe an algorithm for determining the return distribution that will result when option positions are taken on stocks in a portfolio. The distribution is determined for a finite time horizon, and does not rely on the assumption of continuous portfolio revisions. Simulation tests on the algorithm are also discussed. The algorithm is then used to illustrate the effect that several simple and well-known options strategies will have on portfolio return characteristics. This algorithm will be of practical value, giving a technique for generating and analyzing the expanded opportunity set that exists by using options in portfolio management.

## 4. Resource Allocation to Interrelated Risky Projects Using a Multiattribute Utility Function
### Author(s):
- Abraham Mehrez
- Zilla Sinuany-Stern
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
Two major contributions are made to the problem of resource allocation to indivisible projects with uncertain outcomes: the concepts of preferential independence and utility independence for the space of discrete projects are defined, and a multiattribute utility theory is linked with mathematical programming for allocation. The utility function, as shown by Keeney, can be either multiplicative or additive. An overall procedure for structuring the model is outlined, a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving the multiplicative model is developed, and a numerical example is presented.

## 5. An Analysis of Air Force EOQ Data with an Application to Reorder Point Calculation
### Author(s):
- C. R. Mitchell
- R. A. Rappold
- W. B. Faulkner
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
One of the important uses of an EOQ item's distribution of lead time demand is to set its reorder point. This paper shows that a realistic model of observed demand patterns can be chosen from the compound Poisson family of distributions. Actual historical data from several U.S. Air Force bases are analyzed using the geometric-Poisson and constant-Poisson distributions. The control discipline is order quantity, reorder point with continuous review. The service level is based on percent of demand supplied during lead time and is consistent with current USAF methodology. The reorder point is based on independent calculations and no attempt is made to jointly optimize the order quantity and reorder point. Lead time is assumed to be known and constant.

## 6. Effective Scoring Rules for Probabilistic Forecasts
### Author(s):
- Daniel Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
This paper studies the use of a scoring rule for the elicitation of forecasts in the form of probability distributions and for the subsequent evaluation of such forecasts. Given a metric (distance function) on a space of probability distributions, a scoring rule is said to be effective if the forecaster's expected score is a strictly decreasing function of the distance between the elicited and true distributions. Two simple, well-known rules (the spherical and the quadratic) are shown to be effective with respect to suitable metrics. Examples and a practical application (in Foreign Exchange rate forecasting) are also provided.

## 7. The Demand for EngineersProjections Through 1987
### Author(s):
- Fred Landis
- Joseph A. Svestka
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
Engineering manpower constitutes an important national resource where demand and supply must be in reasonable balance to assure continued economic growth. The paper establishes a demand analysis to predict the need for engineers in 15 industry groups through 1987, subject to various economic scenarios. It is shown that for total engineering employment in any industry segment the constant dollar gross national product fraction per engineer is only a slowly varying function of time. A least-square fit of this ratio versus time is shown to be an adequate predictor of employment and can be used for extrapolation with confidence. A parallel analysis is also developed for engineers employed in research and development.

## 8. On the Diffusion of Computer Terminals in an Established Engineering Environment
### Author(s):
- F. Randles
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
The introduction of new technologies in existing administrative and technical organizations usually represents a significant investment in equipment and training. A prudent manager will attempt to acquire the equipment needed fast enough to encourage its use while avoiding the inefficiencies of under-utilization. This paper presents a method of applying a mathematical model to the specific problem of predicting the approximate rate at which additional computer terminals should be acquired. The model used is in the form of a logistics or diffusion function. To apply the model to the Aerospace division of a company, a calibration of that organization was required. A questionnaire on the use of hand calculators was submitted to a sample group. At the time of the study, hand calculators had virtually displaced slide rules and desk top adding machines, and about 15 percent of the organization was competing for available terminals of the central computer system. Increased use of terminals and on-line computing was anticipated. The response of the organization to the hand calculator innovation was established by determining a logistics or diffusion function to fit the sample data. The function was modified to accommodate the additional complexity of the more sophisticated computational capability and then used to predict terminal requirements.

## 10. State of the ArtLocation on Networks: A Survey. Part I: The p-Center and p-Median Problems
### Author(s):
- Barbaros C. Tansel
- Richard L. Francis
- Timothy J. Lowe
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
Network location problems occur when new facilities are to be located on a network. The network of interest may be a road network, an air transport network, a river network, or a network of shipping lanes. For a given network location problem, the new facilities are often idealized as points, and may be located anywhere on the network; constraints may be imposed upon the problem so that new facilities are not too far from existing facilities. Usually some objective function is to be minimized. For single objective function problems, typically the objective is to minimize either a sum of transport costs proportional to network travel distances between existing facilities and closest new facilities, or a maximum of losses proportional to such travel distances, or the total number of new facilities to be located. There is also a growing interest in multiobjective network location problems.

## 11. State of the ArtLocation on Networks: A Survey. Part II: Exploiting Tree Network Structure
### Author(s):
- Barbaros C. Tansel
- Richard L. Francis
- Timothy J. Lowe
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1983
### Abstract:
The discussion of the fundamental p-center and p-median problems in Part I of this paper provides the basis for the work surveyed in Part II. Part II deals with the minimax and minisum location problems with mutual communication, location problems involving multiple objectives, the distance constraints problem and problems involving the location of paths. In addition, convexity issues in network location problems are discussed. Virtually all of this work exploits network structure. Specifically it is based on the assumption that the network is a tree. The conclusion section gives a brief discussion of the state of the art and of current trends in network location research.
