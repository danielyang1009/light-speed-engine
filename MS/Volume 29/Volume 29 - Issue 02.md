## 1. State of the ArtEncoding Subjective Probabilities: A Psychological and Psychometric Review
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
In order to review the empirical literature on subjective probability encoding from a psychological and psychometric perspective, it is first suggested that the usual encoding techniques can be regarded as instances of the general methods used to scale psychological variables. It is then shown that well-established concepts and theories from measurement and psychometric theory can provide a general framework for evaluating and assessing subjective probability encoding. The actual review of the literature distinguishes between studies conducted with nonexperts and with experts. In the former class, findings related to the reliability, internal consistency, and external validity of the judgments are critically discussed. The latter class reviews work relevant to some of these characteristics separately for several fields of expertise. In die final section of the paper the results from these two classes of studies are summarized and related to a view of vague subjective probabilities. Problems deserving additional attention and research are identified.

## 2. Optimal Entering Rules for a Customer with Wait Option at an M/G/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- Avishai Mandelbaum
- Uri Yechiali
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
A smart customer arrives at an M/G/1 queue. While every other arrival joins the system unconditionally, our customer is allowed to choose among three alternatives: (i) he may Enter the queue and stay there until his service is completed, (ii) he may Leave the system right away, or (iii) he may Wait outside the queue. If he Enters or Leaves the system, his decision is final and no further actions are taken. If he chooses to Wait, he makes a new decision at the next service completion where he may, again, select one of the three options: Enter, Leave, or Wait.

## 3. A Transportation Type Aggregate Production Model with Backordering
### Author(s):
- Marc E. Posner
- Wlodzimierz Szwarc
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a certain aggregate production planning model. This model permits regular and overtime production and allows for backordering of goods for a number of periods. Although the discussed model can be formulated as a linear programming problem a special (noniterative) method is developed. First the optimal level of each mode of production is determined for each period. Then the complete solution is immediately constructed. This procedure is so simple that it can be also implemented via pencil and paper. Several computational improvements as well as problem variations are discussed.

## 4. A 0-1 Model for Solving the Corrugator Trim Problem
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Haessler
- F. Brian Talbot
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
A new method for solving the corrugator trim problem is presented. This problem draws its name from the difficult task facing scheduling personnel in corrugator box plants each day: to determine the least-cost method of combining customer orders on the corrugator, where one of the major costs to avoid is waste or excess trim lost from the materials used. Trim loss, however, is only one of several major concerns. Others include corrugator width utilization, cutting pattern changes, avoidance of split orders, and so on. A full discussion of these factors and associated trade-offs is included in the paper.

## 5. Project Appraisal Methodology: Market Penetration Elements
### Author(s):
- Barry G. Silverman
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
This paper describes a multiple competing technologies market penetration model which incorporates multiple attributes rather than strictly price into the market share allocation function. The model which is linear and deterministic was developed in response to the sponsor's request for a simplified technological forecasting procedure. Its principal features include (a) a static nominal market share function based on multi-attribute scaling and maximum market fractions and (b) an effective market share function dependent on market potential forecasts, nominal market share, and a penetration delay curve. The model offers significant spatial, sectoral, and temporal resolution and may readily incorporate professional judgment (it is best implemented in a buyer-behavior survey mode). A version of the model is applied to the advanced energy combustion technology market in support of a DOE budget preparation exercise. Three sets of participantsprogram advocates, independent review panel, and system integratorsinteracted in a series of solutions, defenses, and re-solutions of the model which permitted professional judgment and expert opinion to be solicited and incorporated in a systematic fashion. Model results indicate zero to very little penetration for several of the proposed projects. Parametrics reveal that results are most sensitive to (a) moderate shifts in commercialization date, (b) small changes in market growth rates (for technological penetrating expansion markets only), and (c) shifts in static market share curve coefficients.

## 6. A Diverting Structure's Effects on a River Flow Time Series
### Author(s):
- Darryl J. Downing
- David J. Pack
- Gary W. Westley
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
A step-by-step summary of an empirical time series analysis of the effects of a newly constructed dam on river flow rate is given. A model of river flow rate for the 522 weeks of data is built through the transfer function/intervention model development processes of Box-Jenkins/Box-Tiao. Analysis indicates a rainfall variable has a significant influence on the pre-dam flow rate but not on the post-dam flow rate. The model also reflects a differing relationship of rainfall to pre-dam flow rate depending on the season of the year. Physical interpretations of model parameters and determination of implied mean flow rates suggest that the final model provides a sound basis for some public policy decisions that might focus on the dam.

## 7. Rolling Horizon Procedures for the Facilities in Series Inventory Model with Nested Schedules
### Author(s):
- Suresh Chand
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
This paper develops rolling horizon procedures for solving a multistage inventory problem with facilities-in-series. In such an inventory system, we assume that the raw material is processed successively through several facilities before reaching the customer. The input to a facility comes from one preceding facility (or the raw material) and the output from the facility goes to one succeeding facility (or the customer). The rolling horizon procedures form rolling production schedules by solving a finite horizon multiperiod problem and implementing only the first period's decisions. One period later, the multiperiod problem is updated as better forecasts become available and the process is repeated.

### Abstract:
The geometric properties of the sets of efficient and weakly efficient solutions of multiple linear fractional programming problems are investigated. Weakly efficient solutions are path-connected by finitely many linear line segments when the constrained region is compact.

## 9. NoteRevising Forecasts of Accounting Earnings: A Comparison with the Box-Jenkins Method
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature concerning forecasting the time series of accounting earnings. To accomplish this objective an experiment was conducted to compare the performance of Theil's Optimal Linear Correction technique for revising quarterly Box-Jenkins and other naive model forecasts of accounting earnings against the unrevised forecasts. Several results of this study are of particular interest. First, the study indicated that the Watts-Griffin parsimonious model outperformed other firm specific Box-Jenkins models. Second, the Optimal Linear Correction produced revised forecasts that were uniformly more accurate than the original unadjusted forecasts. Finally, the naive extrapolative time series models outperformed Box-Jenkins forecasts of accounting earnings.

## 10. NoteLearning Effects in Economic Lot Sizing
### Author(s):
- Eginhard J. Muth
- Klaus Spremann
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1983
### Abstract:
The classical square-root formula for optimal lot size is a useful tool especially for those manufacturing processes in which labor intensive items are produced in small quantities. There is a class of stationary lot sizing problems to which this formula applies. With learning effects introduced into the production cost of this class of problems the optimal lot size becomes the solution of a transcendental equation. Numerical solutions are presented as well as an approximation which has the structure of the classical formula.
