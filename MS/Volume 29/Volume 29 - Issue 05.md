## 1. An Interactive Multiple Objective Linear Programming Method for a Class of Underlying Nonlinear Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Stanley Zionts
- Jyrki Wallenius
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
This paper develops a method for interactive multiple objective linear programming assuming an unknown pseudo concave utility function satisfying certain general properties. The method is an extension of our earlier method published in this journal (Zionts, S., Wallenius, J. 1976. An interactive programming method for solving the multiple criteria problem. Management Sci.22 (6) 652663.). Various technical problems present in predecessor versions have been resolved. In addition to presenting the supporting theory and algorithm, we discuss certain options in implementation and summarize our practical experience with several versions of the method.

## 2. Development of a Tool for Measuring and Analyzing Computer User Satisfaction
### Author(s):
- James E. Bailey
- Sammy W. Pearson
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
This paper reports on a technique for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction. Starting with the literature and using the critical incident interview technique, 39 factors affecting satisfaction were identified. Adapting the semantic differential scaling technique, a questionnaire for measuring satisfaction was then created. Finally, the instrument was pilot tested to prove its validity and reliability. The results of this effort and suggested uses of the questionnaire are reported here.

## 3. Stocking Repair Kits for Systems with Limited Life
### Author(s):
- John L. Bryant
- Richard A. Murphy
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
In this paper we examine several models for systems subject to both repairable and nonrepairable failures. A repairable failure can be remedied by the application of a repair kit (spare part, standby system, etc.), whereas a nonrepairable failure terminates the life of the system. The stochastic properties of key system parameters are derived under appropriate assumptions. These results are then used to determine the optimal number of repair kits to stock in order to maintain a system having a specified cost structure. The applicability of such models to problems of systems design is illustrated in several examples. Our results make use of distributions of phase type, and demonstrate that this family of distributions provides considerable flexibility and computational tractability in reliability modeling.

## 4. Comparing for Different Time Series Methods the Value of Technical Expertise Individualized Analysis, and Judgmental Adjustment
### Author(s):
- Robert Carbone
- Allan Andersen
- Yvan Corriveau
- Paul Piat Corson
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
Technical expertise, human judgment, and the time spent by an analyst are often believed to be key factors in determining the accuracy of forecasts obtained with the use of a time series forecasting method. A control experiment was designed to empirically test these beliefs. It involved the participation of experts and persons with limited training. Forecasts were generated for 25 time series with the use of the Box-Jenkins, Holt-Winters and Carbone-Longini filtering methods. Results of the nonparametric tests used to compare the forecasts confirmed that technical expertise, judgmental adjustment, and individualized analyses were of little value in improving forecast accuracy as compared to black box approaches. In addition, simpler methods were found to provide significantly more accurate forecasts than the Box-Jenkins method when applied by persons with limited training.

## 5. Cognitive Style as a Basis for MIS and DSS Designs: Much ADO About Nothing?
### Author(s):
- George P. Huber
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
It is commonly believed that the user's cognitive style should be considered in the design of Management Information Systems and Decision Support Systems. In contrast, an examination of the literature and a consideration of some of the broader issues involved in MIS and DSS design lead to the conclusions that: (1) the currently available literature on cognitive style is an unsatisfactory basis for deriving operational design guidelines, and (2) further cognitive style research is unlikely to provide a satisfactory body of knowledge from which to derive such guidelines. The article presents six specific bases for these two conclusions.

## 6. Cognitive Style and DSS Design: A Comment on Huber's Paper
### Author(s):
- Daniel Robey
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
The paper by Huber (Huber, G. P. 1983. Cognitive style as a basis for designing MIS and DSS: much ado about nothing? Management Sci.29 (5) 567579.) stimulates further comment. While his conclusions that cognitive styles research has not served and will not serve as a satisfactory basis for operational DSS design guidelines appear justified, some additional points need to be made. This paper looks at several of Huber's arguments more closely and suggests a potentially valuable role for cognitive style awareness in the DSS development process.

## 7. Market Value Maximization and Markov Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
This paper shows how an operational method for solving dynamic programs can be used, in some cases, to solve the problem of maximizing a firm's market value. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision problem that can be solved via linear programming. The paper shows how to calculate (or estimate) the state-contingent prices that are used to value the firm. In addition, the paper points out how states can be aggregated to make the solution technique more practical. The paper's final section contains a specific example.

## 8. Three-Point Approximations for Continuous Random Variables
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Keefer
- Samuel E. Bodily
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
This paper compares a number of approximations used to estimate means and variances of continuous random variables and/or to serve as substitutes for the probability distributions of such variables, with particular emphasis on three-point approximations. Numerical results from estimating means and variances of a set of beta distributions indicate surprisingly large differences in accuracy among approximations in current use, with some of the most popular ones such as the PERT and triangular-density-function approximations faring poorly. A simple new three-point approximation, which is a straightforward extension of earlier work by Pearson and Tukey, outperforms the others significantly in these tests, and also performs well in related multivariate tests involving the Dirichlet family of distributions. It offers an attractive alternative to currently used approximations in a variety of applications.

## 9. The Joint Determination of Marginal Rate of Return and Interest Adjusted Cost for Whole Life Insurance
### Author(s):
- Harold J. Schleef
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
Linear programming is applied to measurement of whole life insurance to obtain a functional relationship between interest adjusted cost of insurance protection and rate of return on policy equity. For comparative purposes, policy differences related to premium rates, dividends and cash-values are controlled by maintaining identical insurance requirements and constant levels of wealth for the insured. Marginal discount factors, obtained from the dual variables for the wealth constraints, demonstrate the importance of policy holder wealth. The interest adjusted cost measure currently used by the insurance industry is shown to be a special case when the linear programming approach is used. The method used in this paper is sufficiently flexible to incorporate different patterns of time preference for insurance. Finally, it is demonstrated that the trade-off between interest adjusted cost of insurance and rate of return on policy equity is sensitive to the external rate of return.

## 10. A Bayesian Technique for Selecting a Linear Forecasting Model
### Author(s):
- Ramona L. Trader
### Published:
- 1 May 1983
### Abstract:
The specification of a forecasting model is considered in the context of linear multiple regression. Several potential predictor variables are available, but some of them convey little information about the dependent variable which is to be predicted. A technique for selecting the best set of predictors which takes into account the inherent uncertainty in prediction is detailed. In addition to current data, there is often substantial expert opinion available which is relevant to the forecasting problem. The approach taken here utilizes both data and expert judgment by incorporating them into a Bayesian predictive distribution. Precise forecasting models are constructed by selecting the set of predictors which minimizes a measure of variability in prediction. An empirical demonstration of the technique is provided.
