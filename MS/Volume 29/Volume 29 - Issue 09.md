## 1. Averages of Forecasts: Some Empirical Results
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
An alternative to using a single forecasting method is to average the forecasts obtained from several methods. In this paper we investigate empirically the impact of the number and choice of forecasting methods on the accuracy of simple averages. It is concluded that the forecasting accuracy improves, and that the variability of accuracy among different combinations decreases, as the number of methods in the average increases. Thus, combining forecasts seems to be a reasonable practical alternative when, as is often the case, a true model of the data-generating process or a single best forecasting method cannot be or is not, for whatever reasons, identified.

## 2. An Evaluation of Federal Policy Instruments to Stimulate Basic Research in Industry
### Author(s):
- Prafulla Joglekar
- Morris Hamburg
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
A model of the resource allocation behavior of a group of firms demonstrates that unaided industry allocation to basic (inappropriable) research is suboptimal. Furthermore, provision of seed money is generally counterproductive, while the provision of a matching subsidy is not very cost-efficient in increasing the allocation. Innovative policy alternatives are proposed.

## 3. An Evaluation of Federal Policies Concerning Joint Ventures for Applied Research and Development
### Author(s):
- Prafulla Joglekar
- Morris Hamburg
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
Current federal policies toward interfirm cooperation in research and development are designed to maximize society's use of available technology. Models of industry resource allocation behavior demonstrate that these policies are detrimental to the formation of risk sharing consortia for the development of new technology. The reason is that current policies often deprive applied research and development activities of their appropriability.

## 4. A Goal Seeking Investment Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
A probabilistic investment model is formulated as a Wiener process with a barrier. A planning horizon, targeted rate of return, discount rate, and the mean and variance rate of return are the important parameters in the model. Sensitivity analyses are studied. Several significant statements can be made: (1) contrary to traditional mean-variance portfolio models, rate of return variance may not always be an undesirable characteristic, since higher variance can increase the chances of achieving certain types of investment goals; (2) one can almost always achieve certain types of investment goals if the time horizon is sufficiently long.

## 5. The Customer Contact Model for Organization Design
### Author(s):
- Richard B. Chase
- David A. Tansik
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
The literature on organization design has been dominated by descriptive models in its dealing with structure and operations. This paper takes an alternative view advocating the use of a normative model to be used in the design of service organizations. This model sees the extent of customer contact with the service organization as a major variable affecting system performance and advocates reconfiguring the structure of the service organization to reflect this impact. The discussion describes a taxonomy used to classify firms along the contact dimension and develops 13 propositions which convey critical distinctions between high and low contact services. Application of the model for managerial decision making involves the use of decoupling and the paper identifies factors which favor/disfavor decoupling in light of existing and desired service delivery objectives.

## 6. Optimal Strategies for Selling an Asset
### Author(s):
- Donald B. Rosenfield
- Roy D. Shapiro
- David A. Butler
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of selling an asset on the open market. The seller receives a random sequence of price offers, which may arrive either periodically or randomly over time. After each offer is received, the seller must decide whether or not to sell, weighing the possibility of obtaining a better offer against the cost of waiting. A number of authors have established the properties of optimal selling policies when the distribution of offers is known and offers are received periodically. This paper investigates the conditions under which these same properties hold for an unknown offer distribution which is updated as successive offers are received.

## 7. A Multi-Item Maintenance Center Inventory Model for Low-Demand Reparable Items
### Author(s):
- Margaret K. Schaefer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
In many military and commercial contexts, complex equipment undergoes scheduled maintenance overhauls at regular intervals during which all failed components are replaced. Failure to have replacements on hand for all failed parts requires emergency measures at premium cost. When reparable parts are highly reliable and expensive, both holding and shortage costs are high. This model determines the reparable parts inventory for a maintenance center under three alternative criteria: (1) maximizing job-completion rate subject to constraint on total holding costs, (2) minimizing total holding costs plus expected job-noncompletion costs, and (3) minimizing total holding costs subject to a required minimum job-completion rate. Exact solutions may be obtained using dynamic programming. Approximate solutions, found easily by marginal analysis, have readily computed bounds on possible error. The solution methods for the three formulations are illustrated in a simple example.

## 8. An Algorithmic Solution to Two-Stage Transfer Lines with Possible Scrapping of Units
### Author(s):
- J. G. Shanthikumar

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
An important aspect of the efficient design of an automatic transfer line is the ability to understand and predict the effects of the system parameters such as the size of the intermediate buffer storage space, the cycle times, failure times, repair times, and scrap rate, on the production rate of the transfer line. In this paper we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the production rate of a two-stage transfer line for different system parameters. The algorithm is developed assuming that the failure and repair times are geometrically distributed and that the units may be scrapped with a certain probability when the machine processing it fails. Using this algorithm, extensive numerical results are obtained. Based on these numerical results, the behavior of the transfer line is discussed and some interesting observations are reported which would be useful in the design of automatic transform lines.

## 9. Oligopoly Models for Optimal Advertising When Production Costs Obey a Learning Curve
### Author(s):
- Jinn-Tsair Teng
- Gerald L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
Business policy questions frequently involve competitive encounters among several different firms. Oligopoly theory in economics was devised to answer similar questions, but its results so far are largely confined to cases of monopoly (one firm), duopoly (two firms), and many firms (wheat farmers). The cases with n firms, where 3  n  10, are of great interest to business policy, but are rarely treated in the economics literature because of their extreme difficulty.

## 10. An Inspection Policy Model for Production Facilities
### Author(s):
- Hanan Luss
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1983
### Abstract:
Inspection policy models describe stochastically failing systems in which failures are detected by inspections only. We develop such an inspection model for a production facility. The model generalizes the recent work of Munford as well as the classical work of Barlow et al. Revenues are accrued for each time unit in which the facility is known to be in good operating condition. The costs considered include inspection, operating and repair costs. We present a dynamic programming algorithm that maximizes the expected profit between two successive repairs. This algorithm is then imbedded within an iterative procedure that maximizes the expected profit per time unit and the expected profit per time unit of good operating condition.
