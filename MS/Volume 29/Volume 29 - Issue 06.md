## 1. Problem Formulation in Planning and Design
### Author(s):
- Roger J. Volkema
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the role of problem formulation in planning and design, including: (a) the importance of problem formulation to planning and design; (b) problematic, physiological, psychological and environmental factors that can affect the formulation process; and (c) problem formulation heuristics. Two types of formulation heuristics are identifiedproblem reduction and problem expansion. Because the latter type has received little empirical research, an initial study of a problem expansion heuristic (Problem-Purpose Expansion) was conducted. Experimentation showed that Problem-Purpose Expansion may have a positive effect on idea generation, particularly for individuals working on problems that fall outside their area of expertise. Exhorting the importance of problem formulation, a second treatment studied in these experiments, produced little measurable effect on idea generation.

## 2. Human Diagnostic Reasoning by Computer: An Illustration from Financial Analysis
### Author(s):
- Marinus J. Bouwman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
A major complaint of people who use decision-making computer programs is that these programs merely provide a final decision, and fail to present the supporting argumentation, in terms the user can understand. This article presents an approach that makes computer programs more human-like by basing them on human decision making behavior.

## 3. Measuring the Effects of a University Planning Decision Aid
### Author(s):
- Nathan Dickmeyer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
University administrators involved in budget planning must trade off variables such as faculty size, faculty salary increments, tuition increases, and investment in new initiatives. TRADES is a computer-based, interactive financial model designed to assist in making trade-offs and finding preferred feasible solutions. This paper presents the results of an experiment to test the significance of preference changes resulting from the use of the TRADES model.

## 4. A Differential Games Solution to a Model of Competition Between a Thief and the Police
### Author(s):
- Gustav Feichtinger
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
This paper contains an extension of an optimal control model considered by Sethi (Sethi, S. P. 1979. Optimal Pilfenng policies for dynamic continuous thieves. Management Sci.25 (6, June) 535542.) to a differential game situation. It is assumed that Sethi's concave thief, i.e., a risk-averter, plays against the police, whose objective function incorporates convex costs of law enforcement, a one-shot utility at the time of arrest and a continuous utility or cost rate after the thief is arrested. The probability that the thief is caught by time t is influenced not only by the pilfering rate (as is the case in Sethi's model) but also by the instrumental variable of the police, namely its rate of law enforcement.

## 5. A New Approach to Determine Parameter Sensitivities of Transfer Lines
### Author(s):
- Y. C. Ho
- M. A. Eyler
- T. T. Chien
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a complete and practical method for efficient compulation of the sensitivity information of a transfer line throughput. Our approach, which is a combination of analysis and experimentation, is fundamentally different from the existing solution methods. Using this approach the gradient information of the line throughput with respect to various decision variables is made available by a single observation of the line production history plus computation based on the observed data. These calculations are simple enough to be implemented on microcomputers.

## 6. Multivariate Stratified Sampling by Optimization
### Author(s):
- John M. Mulvey
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
An important, recurring problem in statistics involves the determination of strata boundaries for use in stratified sampling. This paper describes a practical method for stratifying a population of observations based on optimal cluster analysis. The goal of stratification is constructing a partition such that observations within a stratum are homogeneous as defined by within-cluster variances for attributes that are deemed important, while observations between strata are heterogeneous. The problem is defined as a deterministic optimization model with integer variables and is solved by means of a subgradient method. Computational tests with several examples show that the within-strata variances and thus the accompanying standard errors can be substantially reduced. Since the proposed model strives to minimize standard error, it is applicable to situations where a precise sample is essential, for example, microeconomic simulation studies.

## 7. Computing Optimal Control Limits for GI/M/S Queuing Systems with Controlled Arrivals
### Author(s):
- J. A. E. E. van Nunen
- Martin L. Puterman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
We consider a GI/M/s queuing system that is controlled by either accepting or rejecting arriving customers. Under weak conditions on the cost structure, Stidham (Stidham, S., Jr., 1978. Socially and individually optimal control of arrivals to a GI/M/1 queue. Management Sci.24 15981610.) showed that a control limit policy is optimal. In this paper we show how the special structure of this queuing system can be exploited to develop efficient procedures to determine an optimal control limit. An explicit algorithm for computing the optimal control as well as an example and some computational results are included.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
Public agencies are very keen on amassing statisticsthey collect them, add them, raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and prepare wonderful diagrams. But what you must never forget is that every one of those figures comes in the first instance from the village watchman, who just puts down what he damn pleases. (Sir Josiah Stamp)

## 9. Response to Decision Problems Under Risk and Chance Constrained Programming: Dilemmas in the Transition
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1983
### Abstract:
Once again we show that the analysis of a very simple artificial example contrived by its authors for a general indictment of all chance constrained programming is itself in error. Proofs and further references are supplied below along with a discussion of other deficiencies and ambiguities in an article authored by A. J. Hogan, J. G. Morris and H. E. Thompson in Management Science, Vol. 27, No. 6 (June 1981).
