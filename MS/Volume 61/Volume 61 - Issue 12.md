### Abstract:
We develop and estimate a dynamic structural framework to analyze the social-media content creation and consumption behavior of employees within an enterprise. We focus, in particular, on employees’ blogging behavior. The model incorporates two key features that are ubiquitous in blogging forums: users face (1) a trade-off between blog posting and blog reading; and (2) a trade-off between work-related and leisure-related content. We apply the model to a unique data set comprising the complete details of the blog posting and reading behavior of employees over a 15-month period at a Fortune 1000 IT services and consulting firm. Despite getting a higher utility from work-related blogging, employees nevertheless publish a significant number of leisure posts. This is partially because the creation of leisure posts has a significant positive spillover effect on the readership of work posts. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate that leisure-related blogging has positive spillovers for work-related blogging, and hence a policy of abolishing leisure-related content creation can inadvertently have adverse consequences on work-related content creation in an enterprise setting. When organizations restrict leisure blogging, the sharing of online work-related knowledge decreases and this in turn can also reduce employee performance rating. Overall, blogging within enterprises by employees during their work day can have positive long-term benefits for organizations.

## 3. Which Skills Matter in the Market for CEOs? Evidence from Pay for CEO Credentials

### Abstract:
Market-based theories predict that differences in CEO skills lead to potentially large differences in pay, but it is challenging to quantify the CEO skill premium in pay. In a first step toward overcoming this empirical challenge, we code detailed biographical information for a large sample of CEOs for a panel of S&P 1500 firms between 1993 and 2005 to identify specific reputational, career, and educational credentials that are indicative of skills. Newly appointed CEOs earn up to a 5% or $280,000 total pay premium per credential decile, which is concentrated among CEOs with better reputational and career credentials, those with the very best credentials, and those who run large firms. Consistent with the unique economic mechanism of market-based theories, CEO credentials have a positive impact on firm performance. The performance differential for newly appointed CEOs is up to 0.5% per credential decile and is also concentrated among CEOs with better reputational and career credentials and those at large firms. Credentials are positively correlated with unobserved CEO heterogeneity in pay and performance, which further validates our hypothesis that boards use them as publicly observable signals of otherwise hard-to-gauge CEO skills. In all, our results offer direct evidence in support of market-based explanations of the overall rise in CEO pay.

## 4. Hedging with Futures: Does Anything Beat the Naïve Hedging Strategy?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jan 2015
### Abstract:
This paper investigates out-of-sample performance of the naïve hedging strategy relative to that of the minimum variance hedging strategy, in which the covariance parameters are estimated from 18 econometric models. Hedging performance is compared across 24 futures markets. Our main findings suggest that it is difficult to find a strategy under the minimum variance framework that outperforms the naïve hedging strategy both consistently and significantly. Our findings are robust to different sample periods, estimation windows, and hedging horizons and can be partly explained by the effects of estimation error and model misspecification.

## 5. Hedge Funds and Stock Market Efficiency
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jan 2015
### Abstract:
We measure misvaluation using the discounted residual income model. As shown in the literature, this measure of stocks' misvaluation significantly explains their future cross-sectional returns. We measure the market-level misvaluation (market inefficiency) by the misvaluation spread: the difference in the misvaluation of the most overvalued and undervalued shares. We show that the misvaluation spread is a strong predictor of a misvaluation-based long–short portfolio’s returns, reinforcing the hypothesis that it proxies for the level of mispricing in the stock market. Using data on hedge fund returns, hedge fund industry assets under management, flows, and individual hedge fund holdings, we present evidence that hedge funds' trading reduces market-level misvaluation. Our results are robust across different time periods and are not driven by market liquidity. Moreover, we find that mutual funds do not have the price-correcting effect that hedge funds have.

## 6. Political Values, Culture, and Corporate Litigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Apr 2015
### Abstract:
Using one of the largest samples of litigation data available to date, we examine whether the political culture of a firm determines its propensity for corporate misconduct. We measure political culture using the political contributions of top managers, firm political action committees, and local residents. We show that firms with a Republican culture are more likely to be the subject of civil rights, labor, and environmental litigation than are Democratic firms, consistent with the Democratic ideology that emphasizes equal rights, labor rights, and environmental protection. However, firms with a Democratic culture are more likely to be the subject of litigation related to securities fraud and intellectual property rights violations than are Republican firms, whose party ideology stresses self-reliance, property rights, market discipline, and limited government regulation. Upon litigation filing, both types of firms experience similar announcement reaction, which suggests that the observed relationship between political culture and corporate misconduct is unlikely to reflect differences in expected litigation costs.

## 7. Goal Setting and Monetary Incentives: When Large Stakes Are Not Enough
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to test the effectiveness of wage-irrelevant goal-setting policies in a laboratory environment. In our design, managers can assign a goal to their workers by setting a certain level of performance on the work task. We establish our theoretical conjectures by developing a model in which assigned goals act as reference points to workers’ intrinsic motivation. Consistent with our model, we find that managers set goals that are challenging but attainable for a worker of average ability. Workers respond to these goals by increasing effort and performance and by decreasing on-the-job leisure activities with respect to the no-goal-setting baseline. Finally, we study the interaction between goal setting and monetary rewards and find, in line with our theoretical model, that goal setting is most effective when monetary incentives are strong. These results suggest that goal setting may produce intrinsic motivation and increase workers’ performance beyond what is achieved by using solely monetary incentives.

## 8. Entry and Subcontracting in Public Procurement Auctions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
We empirically study how the interplay between entry and subcontracting choices is affected by the use of different auction formats in public procurement. The difference-in-differences strategy used exploits a data set of auctions for public works run alternately under first price and average bid auctions. We find that the use of first price auctions causes a marked decline in both entry and subcontracting. We also find that the type of firms entering first price auctions changes with firms becoming more likely to bid jointly with other firms in ad hoc joint ventures.

## 9. The Effect of Social Interaction on Economic Transactions: Evidence from Changes in Two Retail Formats
### Author(s):
- Avi Goldfarb

### Published:
- 13 Feb 2015
### Abstract:
Examining changes in two different retail formats, we show that consumers alter their purchases depending on the retail environment. In both settings, the change in behavior coincides with a reduction in the interpersonal interaction required to complete a transaction. As such, we contend that the format changes reduced a “social friction” that would otherwise inhibit consumers due to an implicit cost associated with ordering certain items in social settings.

## 10. Privacy and Marketing Externalities: Evidence from Do Not Call

### Published:
- 18 Feb 2015
### Abstract:
If not well targeted, advertising and direct marketing inflict nuisance and inconvenience on consumers. Theoretical analyses predict that consumer actions to avoid advertising impose externalities on other consumers. We investigate the extent of such externalities in the context of the U.S. Do Not Call (DNC) registry by exploiting the exogenous timing of the enforcement of the registry. Supported by multiple robustness tests, and validation and falsification exercises, we conclude that consumer DNC registrations imposed externalities on other consumers. An increase in the first wave of registrations by 1% was associated with a 3.1% increase in subsequent registrations. This effect was stronger in larger and more educationally or racially heterogeneous markets. The externality was possibly due to unregistered consumers being more receptive to telemarketing and telemarketers increasing calls to them. Our results suggest that managers should facilitate consumer opt-out, especially in larger and more educationally or racially heterogeneous markets.

## 11. When Should Firms Expose Themselves to Risk?
### Author(s):
- Alexei Alexandrov
### Published:
- 27 Feb 2015
### Abstract:
I analyze a firm making a decision whether to expose itself to risk in an exogenous parameter when the firm can change a choice variable after observing the realization of the exogenous parameter. For example, the firm decides whether to choose an advertising campaign with a less certain outcome (conditional on the same expected outcome) when it can adjust the product’s price after seeing the effects of the campaign. I show that in many cases, the firm wants to expose itself to risk, and I outline general conditions that need to be satisfied for this result. I then analyze the strategic version of this setup with two competing firms, provide a general characterization, and show that in many cases both firms want to expose themselves to risk, as long as the risks are not too positively correlated. This is the case for many linear demand and constant marginal cost settings (monopolies, differentiated Bertrand firms, or differentiated Cournot firms selling substitutes) where the exogenous parameter is a demand, or a marginal cost shifter results in the monopoly (or both of the competitors if the risks are not too positively correlated) voluntarily exposing itself to risk.

## 12. Prospect Theory Explains Newsvendor Behavior: The Role of Reference Points
### Author(s):
- Xiaoyang Long
- Javad Nasiry
### Published:
- 11 Dec 2014
### Abstract:
Current understanding in operations management is that prospect theory, as a theory of decision making under uncertainty, cannot systematically explain the ordering behavior observed in experiments on the newsvendor problem. We suggest this is because the newsvendor’s reference point is assumed to be the status quo, i.e., zero payoff. We propose an alternative based on newsvendor’s salient payoffs and show that prospect theory can, in fact, account for experimental results.

## 13. Supply Management in Multiproduct Firms with Fixed Proportions Technology
### Author(s):
- Onur Boyabatlı
### Published:
- 27 Jan 2015
### Abstract:
This paper studies the supply management of a primary input, where this input gives rise to multiple products in fixed proportions. My objective is twofold. First, I study fixed proportions technology under demand uncertainty in comparison with the flexible and dedicated technologies. I show that fixed proportions technology has a cost-pooling value over dedicated technology, which is larger than the capacity-pooling value of flexible technology over dedicated technology. I identify the critical role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which decreases in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value increases in demand correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability. However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted as a response to a change in the business environment should differ depending on the contract type. My results have implications about the new product strategy and the procurement contract choice of the processors in the agricultural industries.

## 14. The Diseconomies of Queue Pooling: An Empirical Investigation of Emergency Department Length of Stay
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 May 2015
### Abstract:
We conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of queue management on patients’ average wait time and length of stay (LOS). Using an emergency department’s (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we find that patients’ average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17% decrease in average LOS and a 9% decrease in average wait time relative to the control group—a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance stems from the physicians’ increased ownership over patients and resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues. We conduct additional analyses to rule out alternate explanations for the reduced average wait time and LOS in the dedicated system, such as stinting and decreased quality of care. Our paper has implications for healthcare organizations and others seeking to reduce patient wait time and LOS without increasing costs.

## 15. Relaxations of Approximate Linear Programs for the Real Option Management of Commodity Storage
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 9 Jul 2015
### Abstract:
The real option management of commodity conversion assets gives rise to intractable Markov decision processes (MDPs), in part because of the use of high-dimensional models of commodity forward curve evolution, as commonly done in practice. Focusing on commodity storage, we identify a deficiency of approximate linear programming (ALP), which we address by developing a novel approach to derive relaxations of approximate linear programs. We apply our approach to obtain a class of tractable ALP relaxations, also subsuming an existing method. We provide theoretical support for the use of these ALP relaxations rather than their associated approximate linear programs. Applied to existing natural gas storage instances, our ALP relaxations significantly outperform their corresponding approximate linear programs. Our best ALP relaxation is both near optimal and competitive with, albeit slower than, state-of-the-art methods for computing heuristic policies and lower bounds on the value of commodity storage, but is more directly applicable for dual (upper) bound estimation than these methods. Our approach is potentially relevant for the approximate solution of MDPs that arise in the real option management of other commodity conversion assets, as well as the valuation of real and financial options that depend on forward curve dynamics.

## 16. Dynamic Valuation of Delinquent Credit-Card Accounts
### Author(s):

- Thomas A. Weber
### Published:
- 28 Sep 2015
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a dynamic model of the stochastic repayment behavior exhibited by delinquent credit-card accounts. Based on this model, we construct a dynamic collectability score (DCS) that estimates the account-specific probability of collecting a given portion of the outstanding debt over any given time horizon. The model integrates a variety of information sources, including historical repayment data, account-specific, and time-varying macroeconomic covariates, as well as scheduled account-treatment actions. Two model-identification methods are examined, based on maximum-likelihood estimation and the generalized method of moments. The latter allows for an operational-statistics approach, combining model estimation and performance optimization by tailoring the estimation error to business-relevant loss functions. The DCS framework is applied to a large set of account-level repayment data. The improvements in classification and prediction performance compared to standard bank-internal scoring methods are found to be significant.
