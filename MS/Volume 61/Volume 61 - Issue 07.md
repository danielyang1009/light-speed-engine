- Joshua S. Gans
#### Date:
- February 27, 2015

#### Author(s):
- Arthur Schram
- Gary Charness
#### Date:
- March 11, 2015

#### Abstract:
We study a model of a firm managing its inventory of a single product by sourcing supplies from two supply sources, a regular supplier who offers a lower unit cost and a longer lead time than a second, emergency, supplier. A practically implementable ...

#### Author(s):
- Matthew Mitchell
- Andrzej Skrzypacz
#### Date:
- March 11, 2015

### 10. Linear Tests for Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion Stochastic Dominance
#### Author(s):
- Thierry Post
- Yi Fang
- Miloš Kopa
#### Date:
- August 13, 2014
#### Abstract:
We develop and implement linear formulations of convex stochastic dominance relations based on decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) for discrete and polyhedral choice sets. Our approach is based on a piecewise-exponential representation of utility and ...

- Pasha Shabalin
- Robert W. Day
#### Date:

#### Abstract:
We introduce an auction design framework for large markets with hundreds of items and complex bidder preferences. Such markets typically lead to computationally hard allocation problems. Our new framework consists of compact bid languages for sealed-bid ...

- Tridib Mazumdar
- Bo Li
#### Date:
- August 11, 2014
#### Abstract:
We investigate the effects of a movie star on the movie's opening week theater allocations and box office revenue. Because the pairing of a star and a movie involves a bilateral matching process between the studio and the star, the star (hence the nonstar)...
