## 2. Exploring Trade-offs in the Organization of Scientific Work: Collaboration and Scientific Reward
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
When do scientists and other innovators organize into collaborative teams, and why do they do so for some projects and not others? At the core of this important organizational choice is, we argue, a trade-off scientists make between the productive efficiency of collaboration and the credit allocation that arises after the completion of collaborative work. In this paper, we explore this trade-off by developing a model to structure our understanding of the factors shaping researcher collaborative choices, in particular the implicit allocation of credit among participants in scientific projects. We then use the annual research activity of 661 faculty scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over a 31-year period to explore the trade-off between collaboration and reward at the individual faculty level and to infer critical parameters in the collaborative organization of scientific work.

- 8 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
We investigate how bonus payments affect the satisfaction and performance of managers in a large multinational company. We find that falling behind a natural reference standard for a fair bonus payment (a “reference point violation”) reduces satisfaction and subsequent performance. The effects are mitigated if information about one’s relative standing toward the reference point is withheld. A model and a laboratory experiment provide complementary insights and additional robustness checks.

## 4. A New Solution for the Moral Hazard Problem in Team Production
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
We propose an intergroup competition scheme (ICS) to theoretically solve free riding in team production and provide experimental evidence from a voluntary contribution mechanism public goods game. The ICS includes an internal transfer payment from the lowest to highest contributing team proportional to the difference in group contributions. The ICS requires minimal information, makes the efficient contribution a dominant strategy, and is budget balanced. These features make the ICS ideally suited to solve the moral hazard problem in team production. Our experiment demonstrates that the ICS raises contributions to almost reach optimality with the appropriate parameters. We also show experimentally that the success of the ICS can be primarily attributed to the effect of higher returns and to the introduction of competition, and it is not due to the introduction of potential losses or information regarding other groups.

## 5. Inducing Social Norms in Laboratory Allocation Choices
### Author(s):
- Arthur Schram
- Gary Charness
### Published:
- 11 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
Social norms involve observation by others and external sanctions for violations, whereas moral norms involve introspection and internal sanctions. To study such norms and their effects, we design a laboratory experiment. We examine dictator choices, where we create a shared understanding by providing advice from peers with no financial payoff at stake. We vary whether advice is given, as well as whether choices are made public. This design allows us to explicitly separate the effects of moral and social norms. We find that choices are in fact affected by a combination of observability and shared understanding.

## 6. Analysis of Tailored Base-Surge Policies in Dual Sourcing Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
We study a model of a firm managing its inventory of a single product by sourcing supplies from two supply sources, a regular supplier who offers a lower unit cost and a longer lead time than a second, emergency, supplier. A practically implementable policy for such a firm is a tailored base-surge (TBS) policy [Allon G, Van Mieghem JA (2010) Global dual sourcing: Tailored base-surge allocation to near- and offshore production. Management Sci. 56(1):110–124] to manage its inventory. Under this policy, the firm procures a constant quantity from the regular supplier in every period and dynamically makes procurement decisions for the emergency supplier. Allon and Van Mieghem describe this practice as using the regular supplier to meet a base level of demand and the emergency supplier to manage demand surges, and they conjecture that this practice is most effective when the lead time difference between the two suppliers is large. We confirm these statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result: when demand is composed of a base demand random component plus a surge demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability, the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances. The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery) to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.

## 7. An Empirical Investigation on the Appointments of Supply Chain and Operations Management Executives
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Oct 2014
### Abstract:
This paper provides empirical evidence on the performance effects and choice of appointments of supply chain and operations management executives (SCOMEs). The analysis is based on a sample of 681 SCOME appointments that were publicly announced during the 2000–2011 period. We find that the stock market reaction is positive on the day of the announcement. Categorizing the SCOME appointments as new or old and insider or outsider, we find that the market reaction for newly created SCOME positions is positive. The market also reacts more positively when a SCOME is an outsider rather than an insider. The strongest positive reaction is observed when outsiders are hired for newly created SCOME positions. We find evidence of both poor stock price performance and poor operating performance in the period preceding the appointment of new SCOMEs. New SCOME appointments are not followed by an immediate improvement in stock price and operating performance. However, there is no further decline in performance, suggesting that the decline observed in the preappointment period does not continue after the new SCOME is appointed. We also find that the likelihood of a SCOME being an outsider is greater for firms that are smaller, operate in more concentrated industries, and have experienced poor prior performance.

## 8. Optimal Advance Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Feb 2015
### Abstract:
The dynamic assignment of patients to exam days in order to manage daily variations in demand and capacity is a long-standing open research area in appointment scheduling. In particular, the dynamic assignment of advance appointments has been considered to be especially challenging because of its high dimensionality. We consider a canonical model of dynamic advance scheduling with two patient classes: an urgent demand class, which must be served on the day of arrival, and a regular demand class, which can be served at a future date. Patients take the earliest appointments offered and do not differentiate among providers. We derive a surprising characterization of an optimal policy and an algorithm to compute the policy exactly and efficiently. These are, to our knowledge, the first analytical results for the dynamic advance assignment of patients to exam days. We introduce the property of successive refinability, which allows advance schedules to be easily computable and under which there is no cost to the system to making advance commitments to patients. We allow multiple types of capacity to be considered and both demand and capacity to be nonstationary and stochastic.

## 9. A Theory of Market Pioneers, Dynamic Capabilities, and Industry Evolution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
We analyze a model of industry evolution where the number of active submarkets is endogenously determined by pioneering innovation from incumbents and entrants. Incumbent pioneers enjoy an advantage of additional pioneering innovation via a dynamic capability that takes the form of an improved technology for innovation in young submarkets. Entrants are motivated in part by a desire to acquire the dynamic capability. We show that dynamic capabilities increase total innovation, but whether the capability confers an advantage in terms of marginal or average cost is important in determining how the impact of dynamic capabilities is distributed across incumbent and entrant innovation rates. We complement the existing literature—that focuses on exogenous arrival of submarkets or the steady state of a model with constant submarkets—by describing how competition, free entry, and the dynamic capability of incumbents drive the evolution of an industry. The shift from immature to mature submarkets can lead to a shakeout in firm numbers, and it eventually leads to a reduction in total dynamic capabilities in an industry.

## 10. Linear Tests for Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Aug 2014
### Abstract:
We develop and implement linear formulations of convex stochastic dominance relations based on decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) for discrete and polyhedral choice sets. Our approach is based on a piecewise-exponential representation of utility and a local linear approximation to the exponentiation of log marginal utility. An empirical application to historical stock market data suggests that a passive stock market portfolio is DARA stochastic dominance inefficient relative to concentrated portfolios of small-cap stocks. The mean-variance rule and Nth-order stochastic dominance rules substantially underestimate the degree of market portfolio inefficiency because they do not penalize the unfavorable skewness of diversified portfolios, in violation of DARA.

### Published:
- 2 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
Using China's stock market as the testing venue, this study examines how corporate transparency helps explain the sensitivity of stock prices to general investor sentiment. We find that firms with low corporate transparency, measured by a battery of proxies including state ownership, the prevalence of related party transactions, accrual-based earnings management, audit opinions, and the quality of audit firms, are more affected by investor sentiment than are firms with high corporate transparency. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of corporate transparency in mitigating the effects of investor sentiment on stock prices.

## 12. Repurchasing Debt
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Aug 2014
### Abstract:
In this paper we build a theoretical model of a firm repurchasing its corporate debt. We find that firm creditors as a group sell debt to the firm only at face value. However, because of the cross-creditor externalities, buying back debt is cheaper and easier when there are many creditors, e.g., when debt is traded on the open market. We further show that repurchases contribute to flexibility in firms' capital structure and can increase ex ante firm value. The value of repurchases to the shareholders increases with the firm's ability to save cash and delay the repurchase.

## 13. Management Earnings Forecasts and Value of Analyst Forecast Revisions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
This study examines the stock-price reactions to analyst forecast revisions around earnings announcements to test whether preannouncement forecasts reflect analysts' private information or piggybacking on confounding events and news. We find that management earnings forecasts influence the timing and precision of analyst forecasts. More importantly, evidence suggests that prior studies' finding of weaker (stronger) stock-price responses to forecast revisions in the period immediately after (before) the prior-quarter earnings announcement disappears once management earnings forecasts are controlled for. To the extent that management earnings forecasts are public disclosures, our results suggest that the importance of analysts' information discovery role documented in prior studies is likely to be overstated.

## 14. Compact Bid Languages and Core Pricing in Large Multi-item Auctions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Mar 2015
### Abstract:
We introduce an auction design framework for large markets with hundreds of items and complex bidder preferences. Such markets typically lead to computationally hard allocation problems. Our new framework consists of compact bid languages for sealed-bid auctions and methods to compute second-price rules such as the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves or bidder-optimal, core-selecting payment rules when the optimality of the allocation problem cannot be guaranteed. To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for a specific, complex market, we introduce a compact bidding language for TV advertising markets and investigate the resulting winner-determination problem and the computation of core payments. For realistic instances of the respective winner-determination problems, very good solutions with a small integrality gap can be found quickly, although closing the integrality gap to find marginally better solutions or prove optimality can take a prohibitively large amount of time. Our subsequent adaptation of a constraint-generation technique for the computation of bidder-optimal core payments to this environment is a practically viable paradigm by which core-selecting auction designs can be applied to large markets with potentially hundreds of items. Such auction designs allow bidders to express their preferences with a low number of parameters, while at the same time providing incentives for truthful bidding. We complement our computational experiments in the context of TV advertising markets with additional results for volume discount auctions in procurement to illustrate the applicability of the approach in different types of large markets.

## 15. Counterfactual Decomposition of Movie Star Effects with Star Selection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Aug 2014
### Abstract:
We investigate the effects of a movie star on the movie's opening week theater allocations and box office revenue. Because the pairing of a star and a movie involves a bilateral matching process between the studio and the star, the star (hence the nonstar) movie samples are nonrandom and the star variable is potentially endogenous. To assess the star as well as movie characteristics effects, we utilize a switching model to account for endogenous assignment of stars and nonstars into respective movie samples. In addition to controlling for selection biases, the endogenous switching model generates managerially relevant insights into the factors that influence a star's assignment to a movie. Additionally, because the star and nonstar movie characteristics (e.g., movie budget, distribution, genre, etc.) are often systematically different, we counterfactually estimate the theater allocations and revenues that nonstars (stars) would have generated had they acted in movies endowed with the same characteristics as the star (nonstar) movies. The decomposition analysis, conducted at different quantiles of theater and revenue distributions, shows that the presence of a star has a much stronger effect on theater allocations than the movie characteristics have. However, the revenue difference is entirely contributed by the differences in the characteristics of the star and nonstar movies. Thus, the star effects on revenue come indirectly through the theater allocations as well as from the characteristics of the movies in which they participate.

### Abstract:
The feasibility of using field experiments to optimize marketing decisions remains relatively unstudied. We investigate category pricing decisions that require estimating a large matrix of cross-product demand elasticities and ask the following question: How many experiments are required as the number of products in the category grows? Our main result demonstrates that if the categories have a favorable structure, we can learn faster and reduce the number of experiments that are required: the number of experiments required may grow just logarithmically with the number of products. These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments. Firms may be able to obtain meaningful estimates using a practically feasible number of experiments, even in categories with a large number of products. We also provide a relatively simple mechanism that firms can use to evaluate whether a category has a structure that makes it feasible to use field experiments to set prices. We illustrate how to accomplish this using either a sample of historical data or a pilot set of experiments. We also discuss how to evaluate whether field experiments can help optimize other marketing decisions, such as selecting which products to advertise or promote.
