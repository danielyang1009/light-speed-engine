### Abstract:
We use computer-intensive techniques to study the informational properties of forward-looking disclosures in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections of 10-K filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We find that firms make more forward-looking MD&A disclosures when their stock prices have lower informational efficiency, i.e., when their stock prices poorly reflect future earnings information. The greater levels of forward-looking MD&A disclosures help improve yet are unable to completely mitigate the lower informational efficiency of stock prices for such firms. These findings are stronger for operations-related forward-looking disclosures, disclosures that are made prior to 2000, and disclosures made by loss firms.

## 3. The Hidden Cost of Accommodating Crowdfunder Privacy Preferences: A Randomized Field Experiment

### Abstract:
Online crowdfunding has received a great deal of attention as a promising avenue to fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. Because online settings bring increased visibility and traceability of transactions, many crowdfunding platforms provide mechanisms that enable a campaign contributor to conceal his or her identity or contribution amount from peers. We study the impact of these information (privacy) control mechanisms on crowdfunder behavior. Employing a randomized experiment at one of the world’s largest online crowdfunding platforms, we find evidence of both positive (e.g., comfort) and negative (e.g., privacy priming) causal effects. We find that reducing access to information controls induces a net increase in fund-raising, yet this outcome results from two competing influences—treatment increases willingness to engage with the platform (a 4.9% increase in the probability of contribution) and simultaneously decreases the average contribution (a $5.81 decline). This decline derives from a publicity effect, wherein contributors respond to a lack of privacy by tempering extreme contributions. We unravel the causal mechanisms that drive the results and discuss the implications of our findings for the design of online platforms.

### Abstract:
We analyze optimal contractual arrangements in a bilateral research and development (R&D) partnership between a risk-averse provider that conducts early-stage research followed by a regulatory verification stage and a risk-neutral client that performs late-stage development activities, including production, distribution, and marketing. The problem is formulated as a sequential investment game with the client as the principal, where the investments are observable but not verifiable. The model captures the inherent incentive alignment problems of double-sided moral hazard, risk aversion, and holdup. We compare the efficacy of milestone-based options contracts and buyout options contracts from the client's perspective and identify conditions under which they attain the first-best outcome for the client. We find that milestone-based options contracts always attain the first-best outcome for the client when the provider has some bargaining power in renegotiation and identify their applicability to different R&D partnerships.

## 5. Does a Procurement Service Provider Generate Value for the Buyer Through Information About Supply Risks?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Oct 2014
### Abstract:
We consider a supply chain with one buyer and two suppliers who are subject to disruptions and whose likelihoods of disruption are their private information. In such a setting, does the buyer benefit from engaging the services of a better-informed procurement service provider (PSP) compared to procuring directly from the suppliers? Intuition might suggest that hiring a PSP is always the right choice because the PSP’s knowledge of the supply base improves supplier selection and management. On the other hand, earlier studies prove that using a PSP purely for its superior knowledge about supply costs is always worse for a buyer than contracting with the suppliers directly. Our answer to this research question is more nuanced. Contrary to the findings of earlier studies, we find that the buyer may benefit from using a PSP. We identify, quantify, and explain all of the benefits and the costs of using a PSP, and describe conditions under which the benefits exceed the costs. The benefits of using a PSP are derived when one supplier is of high reliability and the other is of low reliability, from a reduction of informational costs due to implicit supplier collusion facilitated by the PSP and an improvement of supply availability. The costs of using a PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the loss of direct control over the supplier’s production actions, which leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs, and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion. Comparative statics analysis indicates that using the PSP is valuable only if the buyer diversifies with some supplier-type combinations but not others, and that hiring a PSP is not a solution to the problem of an unreliable supply base.

## 6. Interdiction Games on Markovian PERT Networks

### Published:
- 23 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
In a stochastic interdiction game a proliferator aims to minimize the expected duration of a nuclear weapons development project, and an interdictor endeavors to maximize the project duration by delaying some of the project tasks. We formulate static and dynamic versions of the interdictor’s decision problem where the interdiction plan is either precommitted or adapts to new information revealed over time, respectively. The static model gives rise to a stochastic program, whereas the dynamic model is formalized as a multiple optimal stopping problem in continuous time and with decision-dependent information. Under a memoryless probabilistic model for the task durations, we prove that the static model reduces to a mixed-integer linear program, whereas the dynamic model reduces to a finite Markov decision process in discrete time that can be solved via efficient value iteration. We then generalize the dynamic model to account for uncertainty in the outcomes of the interdiction actions. We also discuss a crashing game where the proliferator can use limited resources to expedite tasks so as to counterbalance the interdictor’s efforts. The resulting problem can be formulated as a robust Markov decision process.

## 7. The Impact of Advice on Women's and Men's Selection into Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 May 2014
### Abstract:
We conduct a laboratory experiment to study how advice by a more experienced and better-informed person affects an individual's entry into a real-effort tournament and the gender gap. Our experiment is motivated by the concerns raised by approaching the gender gap through affirmative action policies. Overall, advice improves the entry decision of subjects, in that forgone earnings due to wrong entry decisions go significantly down. The improvements are mainly driven by increased entry of strong-performing women, who also become more confident, and reduced entry of weak-performing men. We find that the overall gender gap persists even though it disappears among low and strong performers. The persistence is due to an emerging gender gap among intermediate performers driven by women (men) following more the advice to stay out of (enter) the tournament in this performance group.

## 8. An Experimental Investigation of Auctions and Bargaining in Procurement
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 May 2014
### Abstract:
In reverse auctions, buyers often retain the right to bargain further concessions from the winners. The optimal form of such procurement is an English auction followed by an auctioneer's option to engage in ultimatum bargaining with the winners. We study behavior and performance in this procurement format using a laboratory experiment. Sellers closely follow the equilibrium strategy of exiting the auction at their costs and then accepting strictly profitable offers. Buyers generally exercise their option to bargain according to their equilibrium strategy, but their take-it-or-leave-it offers vary positively with auction prices when they should be invariant. We explain this deviation by modeling buyers' subjective posteriors regarding the winners' costs as distortions of the Bayesian posteriors, calculated using a formulation similar to a commonly used probability weighting function. We further test the robustness of the experimental results and the subjective posterior explanation with three additional experimental treatments.

## 9. Global Sourcing and Foreign Knowledge Seeking
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jan 2015
### Abstract:
We develop and test a rigorous theoretical account of firm global sourcing decisions, distinguishing the antecedents of offshore integration from those of offshore outsourcing. Although traditional theories of global sourcing focus on lowering costs, we argue that as high-performing firms seek to develop new capabilities by tapping into foreign knowledge, they will increasingly turn to offshore integration to reap colocation benefits and overcome expropriation challenges. By contrast, offshore outsourcing will be preferred by less profitable firms seeking to tap into low-cost inputs, especially as investments in information technology lower monitoring costs. Empirical analysis of a comprehensive panel of cross-border product transfers by U.S. manufacturing multinational corporations from 1989 to 2004 reveals support for these arguments. Our study thus highlights the effect of foreign knowledge seeking on global sourcing and helps explain recent trends in this increasingly important phenomenon, especially the increasing reliance on offshore integration in technology intensive industries.

## 10. The Reaction of Stock Returns to News About Fundamentals
### Author(s):
- Tolga Cenesizoglu
### Published:
- 22 Apr 2014
### Abstract:
In good times, stock prices react negatively to good news and positively to bad news, whereas in bad times, they react positively to good news and negatively to bad news. To account for this stylized fact, we consider an asset pricing model where the dividend growth rate switches between different values depending on the underlying state of the economy. Investors never observe the true dividend growth rate, but learn about it through not only its realizations but also external signals such as macroeconomic indicators. Under plausible assumptions, the differing precision of external signals across different states of the economy can change the sign of the market reaction to news from external signals in good and bad times.

## 11. Real Options and American Derivatives: The Double Continuation Region
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Jun 2014
### Abstract:
We study the nonstandard optimal exercise policy associated with relevant capital investment options and with the prepayment option of widespread collateralized-borrowing contracts like the gold loan. Option exercise is optimally postponed not only when moneyness is insufficient, but also when it is excessive. We extend the classical optimal exercise properties for American options. Early exercise of an American call with a negative underlying payout rate can occur if the option is moderately in the money. We fully characterize the existence, the monotonicity, the continuity, the limits, and the asymptotic behavior at maturity of the double free boundary that separates the exercise region from the double continuation region. We find that the finite-maturity nonstandard policy conspicuously differs from the infinite-maturity one.

## 12. Contractual vs. Actual Separation Pay Following CEO Turnover
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
Using hand-collected data, we document the details of the ex ante severance contracts and the ex post separation pay given to S&P 500 chief executive officers (CEOs) upon departing from their companies. We analyze what determines whether or not a CEO receives separation pay in excess of the amount specified in the severance contract. We find that discretionary separation pay is given to about 40% of departing CEOs and is, on average, $8 million, which amounts to close to 242% of a CEO’s annual compensation. We investigate the determinants of discretionary separation pay and find, for example, that discretionary separation pay positively correlates with weak internal governance in cases of voluntary CEO turnover but not when the CEO is forced out. We also find that discretionary pay is higher when the CEO has a noncompete clause in her ex ante severance contract. Event study analysis suggests that shareholders benefit from discretionary separation pay in forced turnovers but not in voluntary ones. Our overall results help to shed light on the complex role of discretionary separation pay in the bargaining game between boards and departing executives.

## 13. Sticking with What (Barely) Worked: A Test of Outcome Bias
### Author(s):
- Lars Lefgren

### Published:
- 21 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
Outcome bias occurs when an evaluator considers ex post outcomes when judging whether a choice was correct ex ante. We formalize this cognitive bias in a simple model of distorted Bayesian updating. We then examine strategy changes made by professional basketball coaches. We find that they are more likely to revise their strategy after a loss than a win—even for narrow losses, which are uninformative about team effectiveness. This increased strategy revision following a loss occurs even when a loss was expected and even when failure is due to factors beyond the team's control. These results are consistent with our model's predictions.

## 14. Bang for the Buck: Gain-Loss Ratio as a Driver of Judgment and Choice
### Author(s):
- Bart de Langhe
- Stefano Puntoni
### Published:
- 3 Dec 2014
### Abstract:
Prominent decision-making theories propose that individuals (should) evaluate alternatives by combining gains and losses in an additive way. Instead, we suggest that individuals seek to maximize the rate of exchange between positive and negative outcomes and thus combine gains and losses in a multiplicative way. Sensitivity to gain-loss ratio provides an alternative account for several existing findings and implies a number of novel predictions. It implies greater sensitivity to losses and risk aversion when expected value is positive, but greater sensitivity to gains and risk seeking when expected value is negative. It also implies more extreme preferences when expected value is positive than when expected value is negative. These predictions are independent of decreasing marginal sensitivity, loss aversion, and probability weighting—three key properties of prospect theory. Five new experiments and reanalyses of two recently published studies support these predictions.

## 15. Aggregate Impact of Different Brand Development Strategies

### Abstract:
Current branding literature investigates the spillover effects and extension effects due to the introduction of product extensions. However, no study so far has evaluated the aggregate market impact of these effects across different brand development strategies or accounted for the strategic decision to introduce the extension. It is important to examine the above given the significant investments and the high failure rates associated with the introduction of new product extensions. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that derives revenue outcome due to an extension introduction as a function of spillover and extension effects. We empirically estimate the above effects through a Bayesian endogenous switching model that jointly models market shares of the extension and its parent brand along with the strategic decision to introduce the extension and the endogeneity in prices. By using a data set that covers 155 extensions introduced across 20 U.S. geographic markets, we obtain several new generalizable empirical insights. Our results show that spillover effects are higher for brand extensions, whereas line extensions benefit through larger extension effects. We find that vertically differentiating a line extension in terms of increased quality mitigates its negative spillover effects. The addition of a new brand name (i.e., sub-branding) lowers spillover effects for line extensions, whereas it increases the market performance for brand extensions. Our findings provide several strategic implications for manufacturers to successfully introduce and manage product extensions.

## 16. Digital Content Provision and Optimal Copyright Protection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
Advances in digital technologies have led to an increasing concern about piracy for providers of digital content (e.g., e-books, games, music, software, videos). Yet controversies exist over the influence of copyright protection on firm profitability. The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative rationale for the growing anti-protection trend and to investigate optimal copyright enforcement and quality provision in a monopoly setting. The proposed economic mechanism centers on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when consumers can get to know the firm’s actions (e.g., price, quality) only after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus, thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower quality as copyright enforcement increases. Interestingly, quality unobservability can moderate this strategic effect and thus lead to an increasing incentive for copyright protection.
