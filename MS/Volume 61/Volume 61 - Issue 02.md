## 2. Sex Hormones and Competitive Bidding
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We correlate competitive bidding and profits in symmetric independent private value first-price auctions with salivary testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol in more than 200 subjects. Bids are significantly positively correlated and profits are significantly negatively correlated with basal salivary progesterone, but only for females who do not use hormonal contraceptives. Surprisingly, we have null findings for basal testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol for both males and females. We show that our finding for progesterone is not mediated by risk aversion or bidding mistakes. No hormone responds to total profits in the auctions except for a small positive response of the stress hormone cortisol in males.

### Abstract:
Statistical aggregation is often used to combine multiple opinions within a group. Such aggregates outperform individuals, including experts, in various prediction and estimation tasks. This result is attributed to the “wisdom of crowds.” We seek to improve the quality of such aggregates by eliminating poorly performing individuals from the crowd. We propose a new measure of contribution to assess the judges' performance relative to the group and use positive contributors to build a weighting model for aggregating forecasts. In Study 1, we analyze 1,233 judges forecasting almost 200 current events to illustrate the superiority of our model over unweighted models and models weighted by measures of absolute performance. In Study 2, we replicate our findings by using economic forecasts from the European Central Bank and show how the method can be used to identify smaller crowds of the top positive contributors. We show that the model derives its power from identifying experts who consistently outperform the crowd.

## 4. A Market Discovery Algorithm to Estimate a General Class of Nonparametric Choice Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 29 Oct 2014
### Abstract:
We propose an approach for estimating customer preferences for a set of substitutable products using only sales transactions and product availability data. The underlying demand framework combines a general, nonparametric discrete choice model with a Bernoulli process of arrivals over time. The choice model is defined by a discrete probability mass function (pmf) on a set of possible preference rankings of alternatives, and it is compatible with any random utility model. An arriving customer is assumed to purchase the available option that ranks highest in her preference list. The problem we address is how to jointly estimate the arrival rate and the pmf of the rank-based choice model under a maximum likelihood criterion. Since the potential number of customer types is factorial, we propose a market discovery algorithm that starts with a parsimonious set of types and enlarge it by automatically generating new types that increase the likelihood value. Numerical experiments confirm the potential of our proposal. For a realistic data set in the hospitality industry, our approach improves the root mean square errors between predicted and observed purchases computed under independent demand model estimates by 67% to 93%.

## 5. Dynamic Bargaining in a Supply Chain with Asymmetric Demand Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Aug 2014
### Abstract:
We analyze a dynamic bargaining game in which a seller and a buyer negotiate over quantity and payment to trade for a product. Both firms are impatient, and they make alternating offers until an agreement is reached. The buyer is privately informed about his type, which can be high or low: the high type's demand is stochastically larger than the low type's. In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an endogenous and type-dependent reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal–agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win–lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.

## 6. Appointment Scheduling with Limited Distributional Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 May 2014
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop distribution-free models that solve the appointment sequencing and scheduling problem by assuming only moments information of job durations. We show that our min–max appointment scheduling models, which minimize the worst-case expected waiting and overtime costs out of all probability distributions with the given marginal moments, can be exactly formulated as tractable conic programs. These formulations are obtained by exploiting hidden convexity of the problem. In the special case where only the first two marginal moments are given, the problem can be reformulated as a second-order cone program. Based on the structural properties of this formulation, under a mild condition, we derive the optimal time allowances in closed form and prove that it is optimal to sequence jobs in increasing order of job duration variance. We also prove similar results regarding the optimal time allowances and sequence for the case where only means and supports of job durations are known.

## 7. Sorting Effects of Performance Pay
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
Compensation not only provides incentives to an existing manager but also affects the type of manager attracted to the firm. This paper examines the dual incentive and sorting effects of performance pay in a simple contracting model of endogenous participation. Unless the manager is highly risk averse, sorting dampens optimal pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) because PPS beyond a nominal amount transfers unnecessary (information) rent to the manager. This helps explain why empirical estimates of PPS are much lower than predictions from models of moral hazard alone. The model also predicts that sorting under asymmetric information causes the firm to turn away more candidates than would be efficient; PPS increases in the cost of hiring the manager and in the manager's outside option, but decreases in output risk, information risk, and managerial risk aversion; and the firm becomes more selective in hiring as either the manager's outside option, the cost of hiring, risk aversion, output risk, or information risk increases.

## 8. Do Temporary Increases in Information Asymmetry Affect the Cost of Equity?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Jun 2014
### Abstract:
Prior literature finds that long-lasting changes in firms' disclosure policies and information environment affect the cost of equity. Information asymmetry, however, also changes during the fiscal quarter. Firms disclose information periodically, and in between disclosure dates, traders can obtain private information, and adverse-selection risk increases. Such temporary increases in information asymmetry are usually considered to be diversifiable or too small to impact expected stock returns. In addition, investors may postpone trades or sell other assets in their portfolio on high information asymmetry days. We, however, find that returns increase significantly on days during the fiscal quarter when adverse-selection risk is high and liquidity low. Consistent with theory, we show that temporary asymmetry affects returns when investors demand liquidity and market makers bear risk for carrying capacity and providing it.

## 9. Do Incumbents Improve Service Quality in Response to Entry? Evidence from Airlines' On-Time Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
We examine if and how incumbent firms respond to entry and entry threats using nonprice modes of competition. Our analysis focuses on airline service quality. We find that incumbent on-time performance (OTP) actually worsens in response to entry, and even entry threats, by Southwest Airlines. Since Southwest is both a top-performing airline in OTP and a low-cost carrier (LCC), we conjecture that this response by incumbents may be due to a cost-cutting strategy that allows for intense postentry price competition along with preentry deterrence, or it may be due to a postentry differentiation strategy along with preentry accommodation. Further analysis of entry and entry threats by other airlines is inconclusive, providing evidence that is partially consistent with both hypotheses. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of worsening OTP can only be observed when the (potential) entrant is a LCC (Southwest, Jet Blue, and AirTran).

## 10. Strategic Resource Allocation: Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and the Value of Strategic Buckets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 May 2014
### Abstract:
When senior managers make the critical decision of whether to assign resources to a strategic initiative, they have less precise initiative-specific information than project managers who execute such initiatives. Senior management chooses between a decision process that dictates the resource level (top-down) and one that delegates the resource decision and gives up control in favor of more precise information (bottom-up). We investigate this choice and vary the amount of information asymmetry between stakeholders, the “penalty for failure” imposed upon project managers, and how challenging the initiative is for the firm. We find that no single decision process is the “best.” Bottom-up processes are beneficial for more challenging initiatives. Increased organizational penalties may prompt the firm to choose a narrower scope and deter the approval of profitable initiatives. Such penalties, however, enable an effective decision process known as “strategic buckets” that holds the potential to achieve first-best resource allocation levels.

## 11. Macroeconomic Volatilities and Long-Run Risks of Asset Prices
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
In this paper, motivated by existing and growing evidence on multiple macroeconomic volatilities, we extend the long-run risks model by allowing both a long- and a short-run volatility components in the evolution of economic fundamentals. With this extension, the new model not only is consistent with the volatility literature that the stock market is driven by two, rather than one, volatility factors, but also provides significant improvements in fitting various patterns, such as the size of market risk premium, the level of interest rate, degree of dividend yield predictability, and the term structure of variance risk premiums, of both the equity and option data.

## 12. The Effect of Electronic Commerce on Geographic Purchasing Patterns and Price Dispersion
### Author(s):
- Eric Overby

### Published:
- 22 Sep 2014
### Abstract:
The “law of one price” states that if prices for the same or highly similar goods vary across geographic locations by more than the cost of transport, then traders will shift supply and demand to exploit the price differences. However, several frictions prevent traders from doing this, including lack of information about prices and difficulty trading across locations. Electronic commerce has the potential to reduce these frictions by increasing price visibility and lowering transaction costs. We analyze this by studying how the diffusion of an electronic channel affected geographic trading patterns and price dispersion in the wholesale used vehicle market from 2003 to 2008. We find that buyers used the channel to shift their demand geographically to exploit price differences, which reduced geographic price dispersion. We find that the electronic channel also influenced how sellers distributed supply, but we find little evidence that this led to reduced geographic price dispersion.

## 13. Latent Homophily or Social Influence? An Empirical Analysis of Purchase Within a Social Network
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jun 2014
### Abstract:
Consumers who are close to one another in a social network often make similar purchase decisions. This similarity can result from latent homophily or social influence, as well as common exogenous factors. Latent homophily means consumers who are connected to one another are likely to have similar characteristics and product preferences. Social influence refers to the ability of one consumer to directly influence another consumer's decision based upon their communication. We present an empirical study of purchases of caller ring-back tones using data from an Asian mobile network that predicts consumers' purchase timing and choice decisions. We simultaneously measure latent homophily and social influence, while also accounting for exogenous factors. Identification is achieved due to our dynamic, panel data structure and the availability of detailed communication data. We find strong influence effects and latent homophily effects in both the purchase timing and product choice decisions of consumers.

## 14. Timing of Product Allocation: Using Probabilistic Selling to Enhance Inventory Management
### Author(s):
- Scott Fay
- Jinhong Xie
### Published:
- 17 Jul 2014
### Abstract:
This paper examines probabilistic selling (PS) as an inventory-management mechanism, paying special attention to the impact of the timing of product assignment to buyers of probabilistic goods. In practice, sellers tend to offer probabilistic products only after major demand uncertainty has been resolved. By deferring product assignments, a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However, our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer. Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes higher inventory costs (as a result of larger required inventory levels), it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should order less inventory (relative to the case where probabilistic goods are not offered) if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise. Finally, we show that PS, as an inventory-management mechanism, can create a win–win situation, both improving profit and increasing social welfare.
