## 1. Dynamic Inventory Policy with Varying Stochastic Demands
### Author(s):
- Samuel Karlin
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
A dynamic inventory model is formulated in which the demand distributions may change from period to period. The optimal policy at each stage is characterized by a single critical number which also could vary in successive periods. The dependence of the critical numbers as a function of stochastic ordering amongst distributions is developed under various conditions. Most of the studies are conducted under the assumption of linear purchasing cost. In ยง3 the possibility of convex purchasing cost is allowed.

## 2. Linear Programming and Sequential Decisions
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
Using an illustration drawn from the area of inventory control, this paper demonstrates how a typical sequential probabilistic model may be formulated in terms of (a) an initial decision rule and (b) a Markov process, and then optimized by means of linear programming. This linear programming technique may turn out to be an efficient alternative to the functional equation approach in the numerical analysis of such problems. Regardless of computational significance, however, it is of interest that there should be such a close relationship between the two traditionally distinct areas of dynamic programming and linear programming.

## 3. On the Optimality of Pure Strategies
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
In Manne [Manne, A. S. 1960. Linear programming and sequential decisions. Management Sci. (April).] has suggested a linear programming formulation for on optimal steady state solution of sequential decision models. In this note we offer a proof which appeals primarily to the properties of linear programs that an optimal solution exists involving only pure strategies.

## 4. Allocation under Uncertainty when the Demand has Continuous D.F.
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
The problem of allocation under uncertain demand, when the latter has a continuous distribution function, is treated. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is given, and a numerical example is solved. This solution is compared with the L.P. solutions obtained under the assumptions of constant demand and demand with discrete d.f. It is seen that considerable savings can be realized by considering d.f.'s as continuous if they so occur in nature.

## 5. Component Replacement Liability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of an analytic problem arising out of a history. Although some of the context and all of the numbers have been changed to protect proprietary information, the following important facet of the original case history remains invariant in the transformation. Management of the sponsoring firm had planned to make a policy decision based on differences between averages of overlapping distributions. After the influence of the probability distributions was evaluated and explained, management reversed its intended policy decision.

## 6. Problems in the Application of Replacement Theory
### Author(s):
- Raymond R. Mayer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
A great deal of time and effort has been devoted to the development of quantitative methods for the solution of business management problems. Unfortunately, a tremendous difference exists between the rate at which these methods are being generated and the rate at which they are being applied. This suggests that there exist problems of application which industry is not able to overcome. The purpose of this paper is to present and analyze the difficulties encountered in a single, but representative, area of decision-making, namely, equipment replacement. It is hoped a presentation and analysis of these difficulties will have some effect on the nature of future research activities.

## 7. Simulation of a Simplified Job Shop
### Author(s):

- B. P. Dzielinski
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
This is a report of the results of some digital computer simulation studies of a simplified model of a job shop production process. Such factors as the average effectiveness of schedules under the impact of random variations in processing times and the effect of changing operating policies are considered. The average manufacturing times and predictability of completion times were used as measures of effectiveness.

## 8. Forecasting Sales by Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages
### Author(s):
- Peter R. Winters
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1960
### Abstract:
The growing use of computers for mechanized inventory control and production planning has brought with it the need for explicit forecasts of sales and usage for individual products and materials. These forecasts must be made on a routine basis for thousands of products, so that they must be made quickly, and, both in terms of computing time and information storage, cheaply; they should be responsive to changing conditions. The paper presents a method of forecasting sales which has these desirable characteristics, and which in terms of ability to forecast compares favorably with other, more traditional methods. Several models of the exponential forecasting system are presented, along with several examples of application.
