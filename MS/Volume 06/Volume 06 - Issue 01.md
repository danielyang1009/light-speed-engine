## 1. Scheduling with Deadlines and Loss Functions
### Author(s):
- Robert McNaughton
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
The problem of this paper is that of scheduling several one-stage tasks on several processors, which are capable of handling the tasks with varying degrees of efficiency, to minimize the total loss, which is a sum of losses associated with the individual tasks.

## 2. A Few Remarks on the Assortment Problem
### Author(s):
- Wieslaw Sadowski
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
The paper deals with the assortment problem in a particular case—that of structural steel beams. Using the dynamic programming technique we show that this assortment problem is equivalent to the economic lot size problem and also to the routing problem.

## 3. On the Epistemology of the Inexact Sciences
### Author(s):
- Olaf Helmer
- Nicholas Rescher
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
This is a new epistemological approach to the inexact sciences. The purpose of all science is to explain and predict in an objective manner. While in the exact sciences explanation and prediction have the same logical structure, this is not so in the inexact sciences. This permits various methodological innovations in the inexact sciences, e.g., expert judgment and simulation.

## 4. On the Status of Multistage Linear Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
In the first part special cases are presented. Typical of the multistage problems are those encountered in dynamic problems. If the time span is divided into periods, the initial inventory provides the input for activities that occur in the first period or first stage. The output from the first stage provides the inventory input for activities in the second period or stage, etc. [Dantzig, G. B. 1951. Programming of interdependent activities: Mathematical model, chapter II. T. C. Koopmans, ed. Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation. John Wiley and Sons, 19–33. Also Econometrica17 (3–4) (1949).]. In the general case, the need to solve large scale systems is considered, followed by a discussion on solving general block triangular systems that cover a vast majority of practical problems.

## 5. Chance-Constrained Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
A new conceptual and analytical vehicle for problems of temporal planning under uncertainty, involving determination of optimal (sequential) stochastic decision rules is defined and illustrated by means of a typical industrial example. The paper presents a method of attack which splits the problem into two non-linear (or linear) programming parts, (i) determining optimal probability distributions, (ii) approximating the optimal distributions as closely as possible by decision rules of prescribed form.

## 6. The Truck Dispatching Problem
### Author(s):
- G. B. Dantzig
- J. H. Ramser
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.

## 7. Some Problems of Digital Systems Simulation
### Author(s):
- R. W. Conway
- B. M. Johnson
- W. L. Maxwell
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
Our objective is to discuss the technique of digital system simulation. This procedure has already achieved a considerable stature in industrial and research organizations and promises to attain even greater importance in the future. Yet, with few exceptions (5)1, the published literature in the area consists of introductory expositions (10) or of descriptions of the solution of a particular problem (7) where the technique itself is correctly relegated to secondary position. The only publication devoted entirely to the topic (12) is a compendium of papers of the latter type with little attempt to summarize or generalize. Simulations are, of course, as varied as the systems which they represent but they do have certain common characteristics and problems. An identification of these problems would at least allow the investigator to anticipate them and plan accordingly.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
The time adjusted minimum average costs of an industrial equipment or process are expressed in terms of the logarithmic decrement of its salvage values.

## 9. Input Distortion and Observer Overlap in Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- J. S. Kidd
- Fred Boyes
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1959
### Abstract:
A realistic decision-making situation was developed based on the simulation of a tactical military operation. A three-man team comprised the work unit; two acted in an information-processing role and one was assigned an information-integration and decision-making function. Differential levels of information input distortion and observer overlap were compared. It was found that input distortion degrades decision-making speed and accuracy and that the increased intensity of coverage provided by observer-overlap did not moderate this effect. Detailed analysis of the activities associated with the information-processing function were also made. The findings were interpreted in terms of both theoretical and methodological issues.
