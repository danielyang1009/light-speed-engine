## 1. Measurement and Misrepresentation
### Author(s):
- R. J. Chambers
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The possibility of measuring does not necessarily lead to the presentation of relevant information for decision-making in business. This is demonstrated by reference to accounting methods and to profit computation in particular. Accounting processes have become formalized to the point where they misrepresent financial results and position; the probability that resources will be used efficiently and that equity between parties of interest will be served is materially reduced by lack of care in the definition of significant concepts and the concurrent acceptance of procedures which have directly opposite justifications and consequences. As the speed of information processing increases and computational refinements develop, a corresponding effort is necessary to redefine in operationally relevant terms, or to sharpen the definition of, such key concepts as profit, capital, cost. The history of the development of accounting and auxiliary calculations illustrates the consequences of permitting a measuring and communicating system to become institutionalized. Some suggestions for improving the relevance of accounting and similar information are made.

## 2. The Weapon Systems Management Concept and Electronic Data Processing
### Author(s):
- Jim Rosenzweig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the lack of significant progress in the application of electronic computers for expanding the scope of systems of information flow. The weapon systems management concept, and more particularly its civilian counterpart the product mission concept, is presented as a possible frame of reference for top management and systems analysts to use in long-range planning. The functions necessary for successful product mission accomplishment are outlined and the role of systems analysts in the performance of these functions is emphasized. The feasibility of long-range planning for systems of information flow without reference to existing applications or hardware is also discussed.

## 3. Control as an Organizational Process
### Author(s):
- Chadwick J. Haberstroh
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The research reported is an attempt to discover to what extent the theory of self-regulating systems applies to human organizations in general and to one industrial plant in particular. Feedbacks of information on performance and objectives were found to have much influence on two types of executive decision processes: programming of routine work and innovation in the organization of executive functions. The control pattern included multiple, decentralized control loops. This combination worked adequately in an area—safety—where the results of decisions could not be forecasted with any accuracy.

## 4. The Optimum Reject Allowance Problem
### Author(s):
- R. E. Levitan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The problem of specifying an allowance for defects in a production lot is that of balancing the cost of producing too many items against the risk of not having enough to meet requirements. A model of these costs is here proposed.

## 5. On the Shortest Route Through a Network
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The chief feature of the method is that it fans out from the origin working out the shortest path to one new node from the origin and never having to backtrack. No more than n(n − 1)/2 comparisons are needed to find the shortest route from a given origin to all other nodes and possibly less between two fixed nodes.

## 6. A Machine-Job Scheduling Model
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
This paper makes use of a device proposed by Fulkerson and Ford for maximal multi-commodity network flows (Ford, L. R. Jr., D. R. Fulkerson. 1958. A suggested computation for maximal multi-commodity network flows. The RAND Corporation, Paper P-1114, March 27, 1958. Also Management Sci.5(1) 97–101.). A machine-job scheduling model is formulated that avoids the usual in-process inventories and thereby has fewer equations. The activities are the possible sequence for each job of machine steps and interspersed delays; this, of course, greatly multiplies the number of activities. However, a compact network representation of the set of possible activities is developed which permits generating just the activity to enter the basis on each iteration without explicitly generating the others. This is done by using one of the efficient procedures that now exist for computing the shortest route through a network (Dantzig, George B. 1960. On the shortest route through a network. Management Sci.6(2); Moore, E. F. The shortest path through a maze. Unpublished mimeographed report, 16 pages; Bellman, Richard. 1958. On a routing problem. JORSA, XVI(1) 87–90.), (Ford, L. R. Jr. 1956. Network flow theory. The RAND Corporation, Paper P-923).

## 7. Inequalities for Stochastic Linear Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Albert Madansky
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
Consider a linear-programming problem in which the “right-hand side” is a random vector whose expected value is known and where the expected value of the objective function is to be minimized. An approximate solution is often found by replacing the “right-hand side” by its expected value and solving the resulting linear programming problem. In this paper conditions are given for the equality of the expected value of the objective function for the optimal solution and the value of the objective function for the approximate solution; bounds on these values are also given. In addition, the relation between this problem and a related problem, where one makes an observation on the “right-hand side” and solves the (nonstochastic) linear programming problem based on this observation, is discussed.
