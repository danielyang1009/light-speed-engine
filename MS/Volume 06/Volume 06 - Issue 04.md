## 1. A Note About Kantorovich's Paper, “Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production”
### Author(s):
- Tjalling C. Koopmans
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
Discussion on two early papers of Professor Kantorovich, from 1939 and 1949, that proved to be remarkable documents in the history of management science, of linear programming, and of economic theory in general. The 1949 paper discusses transportation models for a single commodity and for many commodities (including empty vehicles), and a single-commodity model for a capacitated network, with applications to sections of the Russian railroad network. All problems considered in the 1939 paper reprinted in this issue are what would now be called linear programming problems. The coefficient matrices of the problems labeled “A” and “B” exhibit special structures somewhat similar to that of the transportation problem matrix. Problem “C,” while appearing still to have a somewhat special structure, is in fact equivalent to the general linear programming problem.

## 2. Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production
### Author(s):
- L. V. Kantorovich
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
The author of the work “Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production”, Professor L. V. Kantorovich, is an eminent authority in the field of mathematics. This work is interesting from a purely mathematical point of view since it presents an original method, going beyond the limits of classical mathematical analysis, for solving extremal problems. On the other hand, this work also provides an application of mathematical methods to questions of organizing production which merits the serious attention of workers in different branches of industry.

## 3. Sur l'Utilisation des Integrales de Contour dans les Problemes de Stocks et de Delais d'Attente
### Author(s):
- E. Ventura
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
The goal of the article is to show how sometimes the use of contour integrals can help in solving problems of inventory and queueing theories by enabling the target function to be uniquely represented in the analytical form min(0, X). The use of those integrals allows us to rewrite some well-known formulas from queueing theory in a larger setting that enables generalizations. That is our goal in the first part of the paper.

## 4. Logistics Research and Management Science
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
The complexities of the Air Force pose a very hard challenge for the development and application of management science. At the same time, they provide a wide range of problems to study. RAND has been engaged in logistics research for the Air Force since 1953. This paper discusses the variety of subjects studied: demand prediction, inventory control, procurement and other decision rules, management control systems, etc. These have made use of many traditional tools of analysis and management science. In addition, simulation techniques have been found particularly useful in fitting together pieces of separate research into a systems context for feasibility and consistency tests.

## 5. Games Decisions and Industrial Organization
### Author(s):
- M. Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
A survey of the current relationship between the many different problem areas investigated by means of Game Theory and the study of Industrial Organization is presented. Several examples are provided to illustrate the nature and relevance of work on (1) two-person constant-sum games; (2) the extensive form of a game; (3) theories of solution for n-person games; (4) theories of solutions for games against nature; and (5) theories of solution for dynamic games. The nature and state of the current applications of game theory to organizational problems and to parts of the behavorial sciences are summarized.

## 6. Optimal Policies for a Multi-Echelon Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Andrew J. Clark
- Herbert Scarf
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
In the last several years there have been a number of papers discussing optimal policies for the inventory problem. Almost without exception these papers are devoted to the determination of optimal purchasing quantities at a single installation faced with some pattern of demand. It has been customary to make the assumption that when the installation in question requests a shipment of stock, this shipment will be delivered in a fixed or perhaps random length of time, but at any rate with a time lag which is independent of the size of the order placed. There are, however, a number of situations met in practice in which this assumption is not a tenable one. An important example arises when there are several installations, say 1, 2, …, N, with installation 1 receiving stock from 2, with 2 receiving stock from 3, etc. In this example, if an order is placed by installation 1 for stock from installation 2, the length of time for delivery of this stock is determined not only by the natural lead time between these two sites, but also by the availability of stock at the second installation. In this paper we shall consider the problem of determining optimal purchasing quantities in a multi-installation model of this type.

## 7. Costs of Incorrect Data in Optimal Inventory Computations
### Author(s):
- Brian Gluss
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1960
### Abstract:
Consider an infinite-stage inventory process in which the cost of ordering an amount y of stock is ky, and the penalty cost incurred in meeting an excess demand y over the stock on hand is py + q; also, the process assumes that demands at successive stages are random variables drawn from a fixed probability distribution. Then, under conditions described in the paper, the extra costs incurred in using a policy that, instead of minimizing the statistical expectation of the total cost of the process, minimizes that of a process whose parameters are different from those of the process under consideration are determined. That is, in determining the policy, it is incorrectly assumed that (i) the penalty cost is p′y + q, (ii) the penalty cost is py + q', or (iii) the fixed discount ratio per period of time is a′ instead of a.
