## 1. Some Observations on the Business School of Tomorrow
### Author(s):
- G. L. Bach
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
Business school training needs to consider the managerial needs of a quarter century hence. This implies greater emphasis in designing business school curricula and teaching methods on the development of fundamental analytical tools and on the use of these tools in identifying, solving, and implementing decisions on managerial problems. Fundamental analytical tools will come especially from the behavioral sciences, economics, and quantitative methods (including the use of mathematics). The “applied” fields of business (marketing, production, finance, and so on) should, at least now, be viewed primarily as important problem areas where best solutions depend on the effective application of such fundamental tools. This approach implies elimination of much of the current subject matter of business school curricula.

## 2. Greenhouses of Science for Management
### Author(s):
- Harry H. Goode
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
The “Management Sciences” must have a science foundation upon which to build a structure to serve management. To date, the sciences making the greatest contribution have been mathematical and physical in nature. But theory, experimental design, and measurement are rapidly revolutionizing our knowledge of the human being so that the psychological and biological sciences may be expected to make a greater and greater contribution to the management sciences. This paper reports the work being done on the research frontier at the University of Michigan in connection with organisms as systems, the reactions of groups, models of human preference, the experimental exploration of human observation, detection, and decision making, and the analysis and synthesis of speech. While these areas are not useful for immediate application at the user's level in the management sciences, a recent symposium on the subject provided a short tour through these greenhouses of science for management from which applicable science may be expected to emanate. The material of the symposium will be reported in the paper.

## 3. Diversification
### Author(s):
- William T. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
The logical structure of diversification as a management policy is discussed through the use of simple examples. For a decision maker who maximizes expectation in the face of uncertain prospects, the kinds of utility functions which lead to the use of diversification are explored. It is shown that conditions of positive but decreasing marginal utility must prevail, and the conditions for optimal diversified programs are given. The use of diversification as a policy for the reduction of variance of outcomes is discussed. For a decision maker whose choices are rationalized in terms of aspiration levels, the situations in which this policy might be used are also explored.

## 4. A Model for Diversification
### Author(s):
- H. I. Ansoff
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
During the past few years, many interesting papers have been written on the subject of product-market diversification. A majority of the writers have dealt with either case histories of successful diversification or with qualitative check-off lists to be used in analyzing specific diversification opportunities. A much smaller group of papers has been devoted to formulation of a systematic approach which a company can use to compare alternative diversification decisions.

## 5. A Linear Programming Model of Integrated Iron and Steel Production
### Author(s):
- Tibor Fabian
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
Integrated steel mills usually have a choice over the use of various materials and production processes. Different ores may be used in the production of iron; steel scrap and iron can be used in different proportions in the production of steel. The economical usage rate of all materials is a function of numerous variables, among which the market price of some materials, notably of various grades of steel scrap, fluctuates and therefore requires a periodic determination of the economical usage rate. This is a typical problem for programming.

## 6. Inventory Depletion Management
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
Consideration is given to problems of choosing the order of issue of items from a stockpile of material whose utility characteristics are changing with time. Conditions are given under which either LIFO (last in, first out) or FIFO (first in, first out) is an optimal issue policy.

## 7. Decision Rules for Buffer Inventories
### Author(s):
- Charles P. Bonini
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1958
### Abstract:
This paper presents the derivation of decision rules for determining the amount of each item to produce and hold in inventory in a multi-product factory. Under certain conditions the rules are good approximations to optimal minimum cost solutions.
