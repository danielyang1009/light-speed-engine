## 1. Leadership: A Frame of Reference
### Author(s):
- Robert Tannenbaum
- Fred Massarik
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
The word “leadership” has been widely used. Political orators, business executives, social workers, and scholars employ it in speech and writing. Yet, there is widespread disagreement as to its meaning. Among social scientists, the theoretical formulations of the leadership concept have continued to shift, focusing first upon one aspect and then upon another. Much still needs to be done to develop a basic, systematic theory. The time seems ripe for attempting a careful statement of a frame of reference which may serve to make available research more meaningful, and which may guide future research and practice. Specifically, such a frame of reference can perform the useful function of pointing to the variables which need to be measured. It can help us to state hypotheses concerning the key variables underlying leadership effectiveness. It can also provide meaningful objectives for the development of more adequate leaders.

## 2. Economic Equipment Policies: An Evaluation
### Author(s):
- Vernon L. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
The present paper summarizes the results of a detailed empirical investigation of the theory of economic equipment policy as applied to one important kind of industrial equipment, viz line-haul truck-tractor power units. The objective of this research was to ascertain, for a type of equipment which is perhaps best suited to exact replacement analysis, the quantitative importance to the firm of following optimal policies in replacement and in the choice of equipment type. Also it was desired to compare actual with optimal policies in a concrete case.

## 3. Management Models and Industrial Applications of Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
An accelerating increase in linear programming applications to industrial problems has made it virtually impossible to keep abreast of them, not only because of their number (and diversity) but also because of the conditions under which many are carried out. Industrial (and governmental) secrecy is often present. Other conditions also bar access to ascertainment and assessment of the pattern of applications. Lack of a tradition for publication is one. Failure to ascertain the general significance of particular findings is another, as is discouragement arising from the fact that similar applications have previously been published by others. Immediate remedies are not available for these difficulties. Presumably conventions such as this will help, over a period of time, by encouraging informal contacts between interested persons.

## 4. Large Data-Handling Equipment as a Commercial Tool
### Author(s):
- John A. Postley
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
The primary purpose of this paper is to present for management an approach to the employment of large data-handling equipment in commercial problems. This approach is in the form of guideposts which, in a very general way, may indicate to people without a background in the data processing field, major requirements to consider or problems which will be encountered in connection with this employment. The problem arises in the military departments largely in connection with logistics and throughout non-military governmental and nongovernmental operations.

## 5. An Analytic Solution of the Warehouse Problem
### Author(s):
- Stuart E. Dreyfus
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, [Bellman, Richard. 1956. On the theory of dynamic programming—a warehousing problem. Management Sci.2 (3, April) 272.], Bellman uses dynamic programming to establish a computational algorithm for the solution of the “warehouse” problem. The present paper also employs the dynamic-programming approach and shows that the structure of the solution can be determined analytically, with numerical results easily obtained via recursive formulas.

## 6. Expectations and Undesired Inventory
### Author(s):
- Edwin S. Mills
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1957
### Abstract:
Both economists and businessmen are interested in knowing whether inventories are higher or lower than firms desire: Economists because it would provide a clue to the structure of business expectations, businessmen because it would give some indication of the future trend of business. In this paper a model is presented with the aid of which an estimate, however crude, of the amount of undesired inventory in the economy is made from market data.
