## 1. An Analysis of Decisions
### Author(s):
- M. E. Salveson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
Most analyses of decision making define decision as choosing from among alternative courses of action. Usually, the criterion of choice is assumed to be some function of probability and utility of the different outcomes associated with each course of action.

## 2. Towards a Behavioral Theory of Communication
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the decision problems of the recipient. The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's “purposeful state”: specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action.

## 3. Cost Horizons and Certainty Equivalents: An Approach to Stochastic Programming of Heating Oil
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- G. H. Symonds
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
Scheduling heating oil production is an important management problem. It is also a complex one. Weather and demand uncertainties, allocation of production between different refineries, joint- and by-product relations, storage limitations, maintenance of minimal supplies and many other factors need to be considered.

## 4. A Computational Approach to the Economic Lot Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Jack Rogers
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
In practice, the economic lot quantity problem and the scheduling problem often are treated separately in production planning. However, when a number of items must be supplied continuously and the same means of production must be employed for several of the items non-concurrently, the “economic lot scheduling problem” may have to be dealt with. Addressing itself to a reduced version of this problem, the article outlines a computational approach to finding a feasible and minimum cost (set-up plus storage) production schedule for a group of items which must be available continuously though produced consecutively in a single production center.

## 5. A Model for the Location of a Railroad Classification Yard
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
- Harold H. Wein
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
The evaluation of alternative locations for an automatic classification yard has become an important problem for railroad managements. Because of the lower classification costs in these yards and the importance of such costs, many railroads have installed these newer facilities. An automatic yard represents an investment of $5,000,000 or more. Hence, the decision to install such a yard and the question regarding its location merit considerable thought and attention.

## 6. Discussion—Mathematics, Realism and Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Melvin L. Greenhut
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
In a paper which appeared in the 1957 edition of this journal (Weinwurm, Ernest H. 1957. Limitations of the scientific method in management science. Management Sci. (April) 225–233.), Professor Weinwurm suggests that the use of mathematics in management science may so dominate a given model as to cause the disregard of vital human values. He cites Professor Bodenhorn who warns that the trend toward mathematical frameworks in economics may be associated with an application of good mathematical assumptions but poor economics (Bodenhorn, Diran. 1956. The problem of economic assumptions in mathematical economics. J. Political Econom. (February) 25–32.). In some dispute with Professor Flood's philosophy (Flood, Merrill M. 1956. The objective of TIMS. Management Sci. (January) 178–183.), he feels that we cannot ignore the nonquantitative factors in human relations.

## 10. The Institute in Action—TIMS 1957 Presidential Address
### Author(s):
- Roger R. Crane
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1958
### Abstract:
My predecessors, the three former presidents of The Institute of Management Sciences, have already established something of a tradition for the TIMS presidential address. Having been involved with the affairs of the Institute during most of a year, they talked about its aims and activities. This address also will concern these activities; in fact, that is its title: The Institute in Action. Before this address is over I hope you will have reflected on something which you already know and that you will carry this thought with you, if no other, when you leave. You are the Institute and the Institute in Action is you in action.
