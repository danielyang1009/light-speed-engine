## 1. Programming of Economic Lot Sizes
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
This paper studies the planning problem faced by a machine shop required to produce many different items so as to meet a rigid delivery schedule, remain within capacity limitations, and at the same time minimize the use of premium-cost overtime labor. It differs from alternative approaches to this well-known problem by allowing for setup cost indivisibilities.

## 2. On a Class of Minimum-Cost Problems
### Author(s):
- William Karush
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
The following type of problem has arisen in various contexts in applications of management science: to determine a program of future levels of activity (e.g., production or employment) subject to known future requirements, which will minimize the total cost of the projected program over the entire planning interval of time. Mathematical methods have been developed for treating variants of this problem, and the purpose of this paper is to present an outline of methods appropriate to problems which share a certain common mathematical form.

## 3. Communication Networks in Intermediate Markets
### Author(s):
- F. E. Balderston
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
Most commodities move from points of production through successive stages of processing or manufacture and further stages of intermediate distribution before reaching points of final purchase. The final value of a commodity, in fact, is often analyzed by observing the amounts of labor and capital services that are added to it at each of these stages by the firm which owns it at each stage.

## 4. The Prospects of a Unified Theory of Organizations
### Author(s):
- Olaf Helmer
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
Despite the success of numerous sporadic efforts in the study of organizations, there is at present no unified theory of organizations. This would require a clearcut conceptual apparatus and a methodology for prediction. To achieve the former within the foreseeable future it might be wise to tie into the existing terminology of game theory; the latter may require taking a new look at the psychological problems involved and introducing something like an operations research approach to them.

## 5. The Use of a Large Scale Computer for Manufacturing Control
### Author(s):
- F. C. Carlin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
Considerations which led to the selection of scientific Computers in preference to a business machine Data Processor for the preparation of Shop Orders, Scheduling and Control of Stock Status. Problems faced relative to the use of scientific Computers to handle large volumes of input and output data. Practical operating difficulties faced in the joint use of a Computer by Engineering and Accounting personnel. Problems encountered in attempting to capitalize to the maximum on the computer's potential capabilities. Advantage of having the programming and coding of a problem vested in one group of personnel. Management benefits accruing from the use of the Computer.

## 6. Evolution of Linear Programming Computing Techniques
### Author(s):
- Wm. Orchard-Hays
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
While the linear programming concept and the formulation of a specific model have value in themselves, the technique would fall short of its promise without efficient computing procedures. The simplex method has proved to be the most successful approach but it still leaves a wide range for detailed algorithms. At first, the method was applied by hand or with the aid of punched-card equipment. With the advent of internally-stored-program computers, automatic routines were designed. However, the early machines were adequate only for small problems and the original simplex method was not efficient for many LP models. A program of development was started at RAND to provide better computing techniques. Using first the IBM Model II CPC, then the 701 and now the 704, general LP routines of considerable power and flexibility have been developed. Future improvements will probably be possible only from higher level abstractions which take advantage of structure in the model matrix or which produce more efficient forms of the inverse of a sparse matrix.

## 7. Notes on the Theory of Dynamic Programming—Transportation Models
### Author(s):
- Richard Bellman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1958
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate some applications of the functional equation technique of the theory of dynamic programming to a general class of problems arising in the study of networks, particularly those arising in transportation theory.
