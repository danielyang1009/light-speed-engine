### Published:

### Abstract:
In the perhaps naive belief that a keynoter has some responsibility to live up to his program billing—in this situation the aim to explore “newer and somewhat more advanced ideas” about corporate planning—I wish to place a definitely radical proposition before TIMS members at this time.

## 5. International Corporate Planning: How Is It Different?
### Author(s):
- Millard H. Pryor, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1964
### Abstract:
Within the last decade, a large number of American firms have formalized their objectives, and have begun to plan the long-range programs necessary to meet corporate goals. As international operations have assumed more importance within the overall scope of these firms' activities, many companies have begun to apply their experience in domestic planning to operations outside the United States. However, just as pediatricians have convinced us that there is more to healing children than treating them as little adults, the blanket application of domestic planning approaches and techniques is not only inadvisable, but unfeasible. I would like to spend my time with you this afternoon considering how international long-range planning is different, and attempt to determine within the context of my own company's experience, how domestic planning concepts must be modified in an international environment.
