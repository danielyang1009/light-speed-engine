## 1. Communication to the Editor—Is the “Diet Problem” Identical to the “Menu Planning Problem”?
### Author(s):
- Eleanor Eckstein
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
Although the “diet problem” for animals and humans is similar in basic formulation, psychological parameters relating to monotony and production factors complicate the model for the human diet. The “diet problem” differs from the “menu planning problem” in (1) simplicity of the problem, (2) complete definition of the relevant parameters, and (3) availability of accurate, complete, and reliable data. For these reasons the designation “diet probem” should be restricted to linear programming methods applied in animal feed blending; textbook examples should use feedstuffs for illustration. The term “menu planning problem” should refer to methods for planning menus for the human diet, including the related psychological parameters and production factors, but should not include projects in data collection or the peripheral problems of menu control.

## 2. Minimax Optimization of Unimodal Functions by Variable Block Search
### Author(s):
- John H. Beamer
- D. J. Wilde
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
A minimax search plan is developed for locating the maximum of a one dimensional unimodal function using a sequence of blocks of simultaneous function evaluations. Any number of evaluations can be made in each block, generalizing a previously developed constant block plan based on the Avriel numbers [1, 5]. A new set of numbers is produced, containing the Avriel numbers as a subset and filling the large gaps between consecutive Avriel numbers. This enables the selection of a search strategy more closely meeting the desired reduction ratio, reducing the number of experiments required by as much as 50% compared to constant block search. The proposed search strategy is optimal in the sense that for a required final interval of uncertainty, known to contain the point where the function obtains its maximum, and for given values for the number of experiments in each block, it has the largest possible starting interval. A plan for determining the optimal number of experiments per block is given. A discrete variable version of the search plan is also described.

## 3. Game Theoretic Analysis of a Problem of Government of People
### Author(s):
- T. S. Chidambaram
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
The general problem of control of a set of individuals to achieve the objective of a controller is common to many areas such as business and government. This paper attempts a mathematical formulation and analysis of such problems. It is assumed that each individual is a rational being acting in his own self-interest. The interests of different individuals are, in general, conflicting, thus leading to a competitive situation which can be analyzed using Game Theory notions. An important aim of mathematical analysis of such a situation will be to study the effectiveness of various kinds of power that a controller might have over the individuals. Most of the results in this paper are concerning a class of “coordination problems” where the controller's objective is to maximize the total utility to the whole group of individuals and where competition arises due to constraints on strategies. The analysis indicates that in such cases the simple power to accept or reject strategies which violate the constraints may be sufficient to realize the controller's goals.

## 4. On Terminating Stochastic Games
### Author(s):
- H. Mine
- K. Yamada
- S. Osaki
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
This paper describes a stochastic game in which the play terminates in a finite number of steps with probability 1. The game is called a terminating stochastic game. When the play terminates at any step, the play is regarded to reach to an absorbing state in the Markov chain under consideration. Hence, the terminating stochastic game is a nonstationary Markov chain with rewards in which our concern is the transient behavior before absorption. In particular, when one of the players is a dummy, the stochastic game reduces to a Markovian decision process of special type. This paper discusses such games. We introduce a new concept of rewards and formulate three problems arising in the games by linear programming. Finally, numerical examples are presented.

## 6. Mixed Model Line Balancing with Smoothed Station Assignments
### Author(s):
- Nick T. Thomopoulos
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
The general practice in mixed model assembly line balancing is to assign work to stations in a manner that each station has an equal amount of work on a daily or shift basis. This paper shows how a modification to mixed model line balancing algorithms can be used so that the stations are loaded more consistently on a model by model basis as well. In addition, the modification now allows mixed model line balancing to become a plausible tool for batched assembly line processes. The procedure is general in nature and is applicable to most line balancing algorithms.

## 7. A Note on Duality Theorem for a Nonlinear Programming Problem
### Author(s):
- Davinder Bhatia
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
S. M. Sinha has formulated a stochastic linear programming problem as a deterministic non linear program, and has shown how to solve this program by solving its dual [1]. Our note extends Sinha's result, by dropping the restriction that the primal constraint set be bounded, and simplifies some of his proofs.

## 8. The Policy Space Structure of Markovian Systems with Two Types of Service
### Author(s):
- Israel Brosh
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
A system with customers demanding service is observed at equally spaced points in time. Two types of service can be applied and the maximum number of customers the system can accommodate is L. The probability for an arrival of a customer per period is assumed to be λ, and the probability to finish its service in one period will be μk (k = 1, 2). Different costs are imposed on the system for using a certain type of service as well as for a customer lost.

## 9. Jointly Optimal Deterministic Inventory and Replacement Policies
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Falkner
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
A deterministic, continuous time, nonstationary inventory and replacement system model is formulated to find the number of orders, the order quantities, the times at which orders should be placed, and the replacement intervals which minimize the cost of operating, maintaining, and replacing a piece of equipment over a finite time horizon. Conditions are given for when the optimal policy is to buy equipments only when the last inventoried item is ready for replacement. A dynamic programming algorithm is presented for solving this problem. The structure of optimal policies is examined for the stationary case. Finally a computational procedure is given for solving the stationary, infinite horizon case.

## 10. Note—On Madigan's Approach to the Deterministic Multi-Product Production and Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
The deterministic multi-product single-machine production and inventory problem is one of the simplest models in which production and inventory factors interact. There is at present no algorithm available which solves the problem optimally, and several different types of approaches have been presented in the literature. Madigan's heuristic method [Madigan, J. G. 1968. Scheduling a multi-product single machine system for an infinite planning period. Management Sci.14(11, July) 713–719.] avoided some of the drawbacks characteristic of other methods, but there are some errors and limitations in his original presentation, to which this note is addressed.

## 11. Note—The Distribution Problem with Upper and Lower Bounds on the Node Requirements
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- Darwin Klingman
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
This paper considers a distribution model with upper and lower bounds on the number of units shipped from an origin or to a destination. Our problem differs from the classical distribution model in which the node shipping amounts are, by contrast, specified exactly. This generalization of the classical distribution problem not only makes the model more versatile from a theoretical standpoint but also makes the model more usable from an applications viewpoint.

## 12. Note—A Note on the Cyclic Coordinate Ascent Method
### Author(s):
- Norman Zadeh
### Published:
- 1 May 1970
### Abstract:
The cyclic coordinate ascent method is a frequently used algorithm in optimization problems. It requires no derivatives and indicates in one iteration if a given point is optimal. It is proved that the cyclic coordinate ascent method will converge for pseudo concave functions, as well as for strictly concave functions as was previously known.
