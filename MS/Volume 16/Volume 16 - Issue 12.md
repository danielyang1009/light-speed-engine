## 3. An Introduction to Some Papers on Urban Planning, Information, Goals and Implementation
### Author(s):
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
The papers which follow have been assembled from two sources: the ones by Dr. Branch and by Professors Eastman and Kortanek were submissions to Management Science; the others formed one part of a program organized by Ezra Glaser for the American Association for the Advancement of Science's 1969 meetings in Boston. As vice president for AAAS' statistics section, Mr. Glaser had organized an all-day session on “Statistics, Governments and the Analysis of Social Problems.”

## 4. Delusions and Diffusions of City Planning in the United States
### Author(s):
- Melville C. Branch
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
A number of concepts and conditions in current city planning are questioned: the grand master plan delusion; planning after the fact; intermittent master planning; the illusion of complete study; avoiding the critical problems; trying to do everything; sematic confusion; conflicts of role and organization; unrealistic derivation of goals and objectives; failure of city planning in the general public interest; deficiencies of planning personnel; inadequacies of theory and research; underestimating fundamental difficulties of the city planning endeavor.

## 5. A New Approach: To an Urban Information Process
### Author(s):
- Charles Eastman
- Norman J. Johnson
- Kenneth Kortanek
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
This paper outlines a proposed method for gaining continuous information about the activities, attitudes, and concerns of citizens within an urban community. The method provides quick feedback on actions and changes made within the community. It monitors longitudinally, the effects of actions and changes on the population.

## 7. Urban Statistics and Their Treatment and Use for Decision-Makers
### Author(s):
- Frank J. Carr
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
While population growth and urbanization are the source of the problems of our cities, hoped for solutions lie in the management of our urban systems. Urban statistics are not only observations of the urban culture but the data used by decision-makers who cope with the individual problems of traffic, pollution, crime and education. The urban information system is characterized by many subsystems having functional and jurisdictional boundaries which defy integration in the commonly understood sense of the word as used in information systems parlance. However, integration of subsystems, in effect, if not in form, can be achieved through the appropriate design of interfaces among the subsystems and with the user.

## 9. Measuring Progress Towards Social Goals: Some Possibilities at National and Local Levels
### Author(s):
- Nestor E. Terleckyj
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
The need for progress in measuring social change is evident. Without measurement it is improbable that desirable goals can be reached. Yet, in contrast to a few exceptionally advanced fields, most areas of social concern and public policy suffer from lack of even the most elementary information, leaving the field wide open for guessing, emotion, low-grade politics, and waste, while the problems remain. Considerable progress is feasible, however. The existing information can be organized and provided regularly, and serious work can be initiated to develop information now missing altogether, improve existing information, and develop workable ways for communicating data.

## 11. Modeling School Facility Requirements in New Communities
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Eastman
- Kenneth O. Kortanek
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
This is an exploratory paper developing new formulations for modeling selected social and economic phenomena in a new or existing community. The demand for educational facilities is shown to be dependent on the mix of housing designs and their sequence of construction. A Markov model, cast in a linear programming format, is developed that explores the relation between alternative growth curves of the student population and the housing mix and construction sequence. Objective functions and constraints are formulated that allow for a wide variety of school planning objectives to be related to the housing mix and schedule as defined by market, social, economic or administrative constraints. The use of linear programming models to facilitate the analysis of complex social phenomena is detailed.

## 12. Dynamics of the Peter Principle
### Author(s):
- Julius Kane
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1970
### Abstract:
In this paper, a realistic Markovian model of hierarchies is considered which reveals that under suitable conditions The Peter Principle applies. That is, above a certain critical hierarchical level, performance decreases slowly, but steadily, with increasing level. This can be true even if there is effective screening and promotion is by merit, rather than seniority. Screening procedures which are uniform, realistic and selective can actually decrease relative performance after promotion. Criteria for the manifestation of this phenomenon will be presented. Basically, it is more likely to manifest itself in bureaucracies having low internal mobility and appears when people who are passed over for promotion improve more with another year's experience than those promoted to new jobs which are unfamiliar and more challenging. Mathematically, the controlling parameter is the ratio of two eigenvalues, each the largest eigenvalue of a 3 × 3 matrix. These eigenvalues are respectively those of two transition matrices, one describing reclassification of successful candidates after promotion, and the other, the reclassification of unsuccessful candidates.
