## 1. Convergence Conditions for Nonlinear Programming Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
Conditions which are necessary and sufficient for convergence of a nonlinear programming algorithm are stated. It is also shown that the convergence conditions can be easily applied to most programming algorithms. As examples, algorithms by Arrow, Hurwicz and Uzawa; Cauchy; Frank and Wolfe; and Newton-Raphson are proven to converge by direct application of the convergence conditions. Also the Topkis-Veinott convergence conditions for feasible direction algorithms are shown to be a special case of the conditions stated in this paper.

## 2. Duality in Discrete Programming: II. The Quadratic Case
### Author(s):
- Egon Balas
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
This paper extends the results of “Duality in Discrete Programming” [1] to the case of quadratic objective functions. The paper is, however, self-contained. A pair of symmetric dual quadratic programs is generalized by constraining some of the variables to belong to arbitrary sets of real numbers. Quadratic all-integer and mixed-integer programs are special cases of these problems. The resulting primal problem is shown, subject to a qualification, to have an optimal solution if and only if the dual has one, and in this case the values of their respective objective functions are equal. The dual of a mixed-integer quadratic program can be formulated as a minimax problem whose quadratic objective function is linear in the integer-constrained variables, and whose linear constraint set does not contain the latter. Based on this approach an algorithm is developed for solving integer and mixed-integer quadratic programs.

## 3. The Economic Assessment of Research and Development
### Author(s):
- George Libik
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
This is an informative paper about the position and situation of R & D (applied) in Eastern and Western Europe. Based on different sources the study also shows a part of the growing differences (different opinions) about importance, understanding and methods to evaluate the efficiency of R & D. It also discusses the “double concept” of R & D efficiency, namely as a summary of successful research results and product application with marketing effect.

## 4. A Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Multi-Level Fixed-Charge Problems
### Author(s):
- Arnold P. Jones
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
Multi-level fixed-charge problems are mathematical optimization problems in which the separable portion of the objective function is the sum of piecewise continuous functions of a single variable. This paper describes a branch-and-bound algorithm that will find a global solution to this type of problem. The algorithm has the feature that a good feasible solution is generated at the start. Moreover, at each step of the algorithm an additional feasible solution may be generated for comparison with the best solution found previously.

## 5. A Functional Equation and its Application to Resource Allocation and Sequencing Problems
### Author(s):
- E. L. Lawler
- J. M. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
A functional equation, similar to that formulated for the knapsack problem, is applied to the solution of a problem of resource allocation in critical path scheduling, and to a variety of single-machine sequencing problems with deadlines and loss functions. Among these are: minimization of the weighted number of tardy jobs, maximization of weighted earliness, minimization of tardiness with respect to common relative and absolute deadlines, and minimization of weighted tardiness with respect to a common deadline. Extensions to multiple-machine sequencing problems are discussed, and the sequencing of two machines in series is treated in detail.

## 6. Artifacts in the Siegel-Fouraker Study of Bargaining and Group Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Swinth
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
Siegel and Fouraker (1960) hypothesize and purport to show experimentally that players in bilateral monopoly will tend toward contracts at the Paretian optimum quantity (P.O.) under conditions of incomplete information (players know only their own payoff functions), even though the theory implicitly assumes complete information (both players know both functions). Their results contain artifacts which severely limit the generality of any inferences that might be drawn from them.

## 7. Multiproject Scheduling with Limited Resources: A Zero-One Programming Approach
### Author(s):
- A. Alan B. Pritsker
- Lawrence J. Waiters
- Philip M. Wolfe
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
A zero-one (0-1) linear programming formulation of multiproject and job-shop scheduling problems is presented that is more general and computationally tractable than other known formulations. It can accommodate a wide range of real-world situations including multiple resource constraints, due dates, job splitting, resource, substitutability, and concurrency and nonconcurrency of job performance requirements. Three possible objective functions are discussed; minimizing total throughput time for all projects: minimizing the time by which all projects are completed (i.e., minimizing makespan); and minimizing total lateness or lateness penalty for all projects.

## 8. Optimal Production Planning by a Gradient Technique I. First Variations
### Author(s):
- E. S. Lee
- M. A. Shaikh
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
A gradient technique baaed on the first variations is used to solve a production scheduling problem with known sales forecasting. The function to be minimized is the sum of the costs derived from holding inventories, stockouts, and the deviation of the production rate from the optimal rate for the plant. This technique has the advantage of being able to investigate problems with a large number of state variables and can also be extended to multiproduct, multifacility operations with complex interconnections.

## 9. Optimal Inventory Policy with Multiple Set-Up Costs
### Author(s):
- Steven A. Lippman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1969
### Abstract:
We consider a deterministic, single product, discrete review, finite time horizon inventory problem, called the multiple set-up cost problem. The holding cost in each period is a nondecreasing (and sometimes concave) function. The distinguishing feature of our model is the ordering cost function which is neither concave nor convex. The ordering cost is such that a natural interpretation of it consists in assuming that the order in period i is delivered in trucks with capacity Mi and that the cost of delivery for each truck is a nondecreasing concave function of the amount delivered by that truck. We establish the existence of an optimal production schedule such that for each period (1) there are no partially filled trucks in period i if the inventory entering period i is positive and (2) the inventory at the end of period i is less than Mi. Exploiting this information, an efficient algorithm is developed.
