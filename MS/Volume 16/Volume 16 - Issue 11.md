## 1. Elements of Large-Scale Mathematical Programming Part I: Concepts
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
A framework of concepts is developed which helps to unify a substantial portion of the literature on large-scale mathematical programming. These concepts fall into two categories. The first category consists of problem manipulations that can be used to derive what are often referred to as “master” problems; the principal manipulations discussed are Projection, Inner Linearization, and Outer Linearization. The second category consists of solution strategies that can be used to solve the master problems, often with the result that “subproblems” arise which can then be solved by specialized algorithms. The Piecewise, Restriction, and Relaxation strategies are the principal ones discussed. Numerous algorithms found in the literature are classified according to the manipulation/strategy pattern they can be viewed as using, and the usefulness of the framework is demonstrated by using it (see Part II of this paper) to rederive a representative selection of algorithms.

## 2. Elements of Large Scale Mathematical Programming Part II: Synthesis of Algorithms and Bibliography
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
The problem manipulations and solution strategies of Part I of this paper are now further illustrated by combining them in various ways to yield several known algorithms. The main object is not an exposition of these algorithms, although this is certainly important; rather, we wish to focus on the principal patterns in which manipulations and strategies can be assembled. These patterns constitute the real common denominators in the literature on large-scale programming. See Table 2 in Part I.

## 3. An Analysis of Private and Public Sector Location Models
### Author(s):
- Charles Revelle
- David Marks
- Jon C. Liebman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
Recent models of location are drawn together and compared as to structure, criteria, and constraints. Private sector models are distinguished as those in which the total cost of transport and facilities is isolated as the objective to be minimized. The solution techniques of six such models are discussed. Public sector models are characterized by a criterion function involving a surrogate for social utility and by a constraint on investment in facilities or on the number of facilities. Five models with this format are discussed and compared. The two types of problem, location in the private sector and location in the public sector, are seen to have the same conceptual foundation, but formats which differ of necessity due to our inability to relate social utility to dollar value.

## 4. Dissection Methods for Solutions in Chance Constrained Programming Problems Under Discrete Distributions
### Author(s):
- William M. Raike
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
Under the assumption of discrete distributions for the random variables involved, deterministic equivalent problems are derived for a general class of chance constrained (but not necessarily linear) programming problems. These permit the explicit solution of such problems for all or most types of optimal stochastic decision rules which are of interest, including optimal multistage rules and not restricted to the class of linear rules. The formulation given encompasses certain cases of stochastic programming with recourse, and the deterministic equivalents derived for these reduce to well-known versions available in the literature.

## 5. An Approximation of the Cost Function for Multi-Echelon Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Dieter Hochstaedter
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
For an inventory model with a central warehouse that supplies two satellite warehouses an approximation of the cost function by upper and lower bounds is presented under the assumption that the satellites follow (s, S) policies that are optimal for the satellites alone. The difference between these upper and lower bounds for each period is less than a fixed number. In the infinite horizon model with a discount rate less than one this difference is less than a constant that depends on the mean of the demands, the holding, and the penalty costs. The results are shown for two satellites, they can easily be generalized to k satellites.

## 6. An Experimental Investigation and Comparative Evaluation of Production Line Balancing Techniques
### Author(s):
- Anthony A. Mastor
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
Although computationally feasible optimizing algorithms for solving the production line balancing problem have not been found, a number of computational techniques have been devised and used to obtain solutions which are not necessarily optimal solutions but are hoped to be good solutions. In the study the most prominent of these techniques are examined and compared by applying them to a sample of production line balancing problems. The maximum output rate attained for a specified line length is used as the measure of effectiveness and the computing time required to make line balancing calculations for a specified output rate is used as the measure of cost.

## 7. Price-Production Decisions with Deterministic Demand
### Author(s):
- Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
The problem of simultaneously making price and production decisions for a single product with a known deterministic demand function is considered. The objective is to maximize profit, and backorders are not allowed. Results which reduce the computations necessary for the pricing decision are given, and planning horizons are identified as in previous inventory research. These results are combined into an efficient forward algorithm.

## 8. Optimal Sale of a Commodity Stockpile
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Kupperman
- Harvey A. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
The problem of maximizing the present value of the return from sale of a commodity stockpile is solved for a linear Walrasian market. Approximations and bounds are given and the practical utility of knowing the solution is discussed. The impact of such sales on the producing industry and the distribution of this impact are also studied. Mossin in [Mossin, Jan. 1966. On a class of optimal stock depletion policies. Management Sci.13(1, September).] has solved an allied problem having a special case in common with the one treated here.

## 10. Précis—Sufficiency Conditions for Constrained Optima
### Author(s):
- C. C. Huang
- L. G. Erickson
- R. M. Wellek
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1970
### Abstract:
The sufficiency conditions for constrained optimization problems are derived through an alternate approach and result in a simpler form than one latest work [Schechter, R. S., G. S. G. Beveridge. 1966. Sufficiency conditions in constrained variations. Indus. Eng. Chemistry Fundamentals5 571–573.]. The relations can be used with equality and/or inequality constraints. The sufficiency conditions of Phipps [Phipps, C. G. 1952. Maxima and minima under restraint. Amer. Math. Monthly59 230–235.] which have been quoted for years in the literature were corrected in this work.
