## 1. Free For All—Guest Editorial: Growing Pains in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Thrall
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
I take this occasion to discuss something of the current status of the management sciences in general and of The Institute of Management Sciences in particular. TIMS, now in its 17th year, is suffering from some teenage growing pains. It was founded by a small band of young enthusiasts who foresaw, quite accurately as time has proved, the importance of the physical, social and mathematical sciences in all levels of management. About half of the founders were in universities; most of the others had staff or research positions in government or industry. There were very few managers proper in the founding group or in the membership at large during the early years and then Management Science, although receptive to papers on the underlying philosophy and applications, devoted the bulk of its pages to papers on mathematical models. As the second Editor-in-Chief of Management Science, I can testify that this was a response to the quality and quantity of papers received rather than a matter of editorial policy.

## 2. Letters to the Editor—Concerning Simulation and Sixty Years of Queuing Theory
### Author(s):
- Erwin J. Durrer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
Professor Bhat, in his excellent paper, “Sixty Years of Queuing Theory,” (Management Science, February 1969) stresses the difficulties encountered by “operational people” in applying results of behavioral queuing studies done by “theoreticians.” Everyone having worked in this field who did not have an extensive course on complex variables in school will remember the gruesome feeling when at the end of his derivation, he is faced with the inversion of an untabulated Laplace transform. At this stage most operational people will give up and simulate the queue in order to get an answer, particularly in multi-server problems.

## 3. Time—Path Types: From Static to Dynamic Typologies
### Author(s):
- John G. Myers
- Francesco M. Nicosia
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
Biometrics and psychometrics have developed a variety of methods to derive empirically clusters or types of variables, objects, or subjects. These empirical classificatory methods have been applied to data at one point in time—they have been used for static analyses. An extension is presented to the case of dynamic analyses, that is, the empirical identification of subjects with different time changes in one or more observed characteristics and their grouping based on sufficient similarity of time changes. Two management applications of the extension are given, the first dealing with behavioral, and the second with behavioristic, data.

## 4. Optimum Time Compression in Project Scheduling
### Author(s):
- L. R. Lamberson
- R. R. Hocking
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
An algorithm based on convex programming is developed for optimum time compression in network scheduling systems. The development allows for the activity time-cost trade-off functions to be any differentiable convex function. Decomposition theory is then applied to reduce the amount of computation necessary. This along with a limited number of rules to structure any incoming vector makes the algorithm amenable to time compression in large project networks.

## 5. Analysis of Factors Affecting Least-Cost Size of Plant
### Author(s):
- E. M. Babb
- T. H. Yu
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
A general model used to analyze the effects of assembly and distribution factors and economies of scale in processing on least-cost size of plant and on cost components is described. This model is applied to empirical data from fluid milk plants and country elevators. In both cases, it appears that total per unit cost (combined assembly, processing and distribution cost) is a continuously falling function of plant size, at least to the limit of observed plant sizes. In the two cases studied, the larger plants observed appeared to have from 20 to 30 percent lower cost than plants of average size. The results of these two applications indicate the basis for much of the current consolidation of plants.

## 6. Multi-Item Production Planning—An Extension of the HMMS Rules
### Author(s):
- Gary L. Bergstrom
- Barnard E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
The Linear Decision Rules (LDR) proposed by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon for the production planning problem determine an optimum plan in terms of an aggregate production rate and work force level. The criteria of the LDR assume we wish to make decisions so as to minimize costs over a specified time horizon, given estimates of future aggregate demand. This paper extends the LDR to a multi-item formulation (MDR) which solves directly for the optimum sales, production, and inventory levels for individual items in future periods.

## 7. A Heuristic Algorithm for the n Job, m Machine Sequencing Problem
### Author(s):
- Herbert G. Campbell
- Richard A. Dudek
- Milton L. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simple algorithm for the solution of very large sequence problems without the use of a computer. It produces approximate solutions to the n job, m machine sequencing problem where no passing is considered and the criterion is minimum total elapsed time. Up to m − 1 sequences may be found.

## 8. Statistical Control of Assessment Uniformity
### Author(s):
- Pao Lun Cheng
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
In most states constitutional provisions exist that there shall be uniformity in the assessment of properties (real estates) in a taxing district. Since property tax rate is applied to the assessed values of properties, it is believed that the equity of taxation will be preserved if their assessed values bear a uniform proportion to their respective fair cash values. But fair cash values are unobservable, because each parcel of real estate is unique and is usually infrequently transacted in a market far from being perfect. Consequently, the relationship between the fair cash value of a parcel and its sale price is difficult to specify. The problem therefore arises as to how one can detect departure from assessment uniformity by using market data of unique properties generated in a taxing district. A review of the opinions of state tax courts in several important tax abatement cases and an examination of a few key studies dealing with property tax administration reveal a state of confusion as ubiquitous as the property taxation itself. In this paper, several models are proposed in an attempt to bring some measure of order to property tax administration. One of the models that utilizes the lognormal transformation of sales and assessment data appears most promising. Preliminary empirical investigation appears to confirm its usefulness in extracting essential information for the purpose of monitoring the quality of property tax systems.

## 9. An Exploratory Analysis of Individual Information Processing
### Author(s):
- David W. Cravens
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
Information-processing is an integral part of decision-making; yet the state of knowledge concerning the individual problem solver in his role as an information-processor is limited. This paper presents a conceptual framework for examining individual, task-oriented information-processing as a multi-stage process. Relationships between variables in the model are investigated at a research site which provides a number of the advantages of both a laboratory and a field environment. The “information element” is used as the basic unit of analysis. Data are examined via the multivariate statistical technique of canonical analysis. The implications of the study are also discussed.

## 10. Maneuvering Liquid Assets in a Multi-National Company: Formulation and Deterministic Solution Procedures
### Author(s):
- David P. Rutenberg
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
Over a finite horizon each national subsidiary of a multi-national company can be forecast to be a net source or sink of funds. Each of these subsidiaries in each year is considered to be the node of a network; funds flow along the directed arcs connecting the nodes. Liquid assets carried by the subsidiaries on the arcs between time periods earn interest minus adjustments for expected devaluations. In each time period a flow of funds between each pair of subsidiaries can be achieved by manipulating transfer prices and managerial fees, by making short term intersubsidiary loans, and by paying dividends up the intersubsidiary ownership tree. The costs and constraints on these flows are outlined with particular attention given to the IRC Subpart F regulations of the U.S. 1962 Revenue Act, and to the 1968 regulations of the Office of Foreign Direct Investment. It is shown to be extremely important that subsidiary dollar accounts count toward the compensating balance requirements of a U.S. bank, and it is also shown that there are benefits to a global tax consolidation under Subpart F. The problem can be solved as a generalized network (weighted distribution problem). This avoids the need to guess at the average discount rate if it is to be solved as an ordinary network.

## 11. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
The lack of application of computer technology to medical service is worthy of note. Although there is a great deal of discussion and an obvious need, there have been precious few successful applications of computers to the solution of large scale medical problems. One area of modest success is that of on-line control. Patient monitoring is widely accepted, and the interfacing of laboratory equipment (such as Technicon's SMA 12 or the Aga's Auto Chemist) is well accepted. However, the total problems of “patient management” have not been successfully attacked.

## 12. Editorial—Marketing Science
### Author(s):
- Kenneth A. Longman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1970
### Abstract:
The business of marketing is increasingly involved with government. For a long time, we have had a specialized interest created by the marketing of goods and services to the government itself. And there have long been various forms of government regulations and restraints on marketing. But it is only recently that marketing practices seem to have become a political issue. I'd suggest that they are perhaps overrated politically, though.
