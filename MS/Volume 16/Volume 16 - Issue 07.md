## 1. An Inventory Theoretic Model of Freight Transport Demand
### Author(s):
- W. J. Baumol
- H. D. Vinod
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
The model in this paper is intended to explain the choice of transport made by shippers, as well as their total demand for transportation services. The optimal choice of mode is shown to involve a trade-off among freight rates, speed, dependability (variance in speed) and en-route lossage. It is shown that faster, more dependable service simply reduces the shipper's or receiver's inventories, including his safety stock and his inventory in transit. Hence inventory theory makes possible a direct comparison of the four attributes on which mode selection is based and leads to a model of rational choice in transport demand. The resulting model is suitable for statistical estimation given adequate data.

## 2. Experimental Designs for Computer Simulation Experiments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
Experimental designs have found widespread application in the biological and physical sciences. The purpose in using these designs is not only that they are economical in terms of the number of experimental trials required, but more importantly, they provide a structure for the investigator's learning process. Experimental designs are available for (1) investigating the relationship of the response to the factors in order to determine the underlying mechanisms governing the process under study and (2) finding the combination of factor levels at which the response variable is optimized. Since a computer simulation experiment is indeed an experiment, it follows that one should give careful attention to experimental design questions prior to conducting a simulation experiment. Within the context of two simulation experiments with an inventory model, this paper discusses factorial, fractional factorial, rotatable, and response surface designs. We conclude by outlining a number of possible pitfalls and contingencies.

## 3. Models of Fact: Examples from Marketing
### Author(s):
- A. S. C. Ehrenberg
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
The first step in model-building is to note some simple observable patterns and to establish their degree of empirical generalisation. The second step is to integrate different empirical relationships of this kind. This is where the more complex mathematical models come in.

## 4. A Controlled Transportation Queueing Process
### Author(s):
- U. Narayan Bhat
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
A transportation queueing process in which taxis arrive in a Poisson process and customers arrive as a renewal process independent of taxi-arrival process is controlled by calling extra taxis whenever the total number of customers lost to the system reaches a certain predetermined number. Transient and steady state behavior of this process is studied using renewal theoretic arguments. The optimum value of the control variable is also obtained so as to minimize the total cost to the system due to the waiting taxis and lost customers.

## 5. An Algorithm for the Quadratic Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- G. W. Graves
- A. B. Whinston
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
The paper presents a new approach to solving a class of combinatorial economic allocation problems. One member of this class is known as the quadratic assignment problem. Besides presenting an algorithm to solve this problem, we will discuss in general terms the techniques for treating combinatorial problems. A novel feature of the paper is the development of the statistical properties of the criterion function. These statistical properties are used in conjunction with a general enumerative procedure to form the main parts of the algorithm. Using the idea of confidence level enumeration, an extension of the algorithm is proposed which should allow for the effective treatment of large scale combinatorial problems. Finally we present some computational results in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the general approach.

## 6. The Stochastic Cash Balance Problem with Fixed Costs for Increases and Decreases
### Author(s):
- Edwin H. Neave
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
The stochastic cash balance problem is an inventory problem in which the stochastic cash (or inventory) change can either be positive or nonpositive, and in which decisions to increase or decrease the inventory are permitted at the beginning of each time period. The paper studies problems in which both fixed and proportional costs can be incurred whenever the inventory is changed in either direction. An example is used to demonstrate that when these costs are positive and the loss function is convex, a simple policy (analogous to a two-sided (s, S) policy) is not generally optimal. The example is also used to display the relations between the cash balance problem and inventory problems previously studied by Scarf and Veinott. When proportional costs of changing the inventory are zero, the two fixed costs are equal, the loss function is symmetric quasi-convex, and the problem's probability densities are quasi-concave a simple policy is shown to be optimal. For the cases in which simple policies are not optimal, the paper develops a technique which employs convex upper and lower bounds on the (nonconvex) cost functions partially to describe the optimal policy. It is suggested that this convex bounding technique may provide an approach to studying the cost implications of following simple, nonoptimal policies in inventory problems for which the optimal policy is complex.

## 7. A Dynamic Inventory Model with Stochastic Lead Times
### Author(s):
- Robert S. Kaplan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
A study is made of a dynamic inventory model with stochastic lead times. A probability model is developed for the arrival of outstanding orders in which it is assumed that orders do not cross in time and that the arrival probabilities are independent of the number and size of outstanding orders. With these assumptions, it is shown that the sequential multidimensional minimization problem normally associated with the random lead time model can be reduced to a sequence of one-dimensional minimizations. The minimizations are a function of a variable representing the sum of stock on hand plus all outstanding orders. Optimal ordering policies are characterized under the assumptions of convex expected holding and shortage costs, a linear ordering cost and a fixed setup cost (greater than or equal to zero) paid when the order is placed. These policies are shown to be quite similar to those obtained with deterministic lead times but some differences in the behavior of the single-period critical numbers (when the setup cost is zero) are noted.

## 8. Generalization of Dilworth's Theorem on Minimal Chain Decomposition
### Author(s):
- M. Raghavachari
- V. L. Mote
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
The decomposition of a finite partially ordered set of elements as a union of chains was considered by Dilworth [2]. Dantzig and Hoffman [1] formulated this problem as a linear programming problem and obtained Dilworth's theorem from duality theory. For some practical applications and for a method to obtain a minimal decomposition see Ford and Fulkerson [3]. In this paper we generalize this problem to the case when the set is not necessarily partially ordered and obtain a method of finding a minimal chain decomposition of the set.

## 10. Addendum to Stankard and Gupta's Note on Lot Size Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Thom J. Hodgson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
This paper presents a grouping procedure which yields improved solutions to Bomberger's Lot Size Scheduling Problem [1]. The group definition is a generalization of the group definition proposed by Stankard and Gupta [3]. Moreover, the generalization leads to a pseudo dynamic programming procedure which is readily programmable. Computational experience has shown the procedure to be extremely efficient.

## 11. Communications to the Editor—A Correction for “Optimal Policy for a Multiproduct Dynamic, Nonstationary Inventory Problem”
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1970
### Abstract:
I am indebted to Lowell Bruce Anderson of Nothwestern University for pointing out to me that Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 in my paper “Optimal Policy for a Multiproduct Dynamic, Nonstationary Inventory Problem,” (Management Science, Vol. 12, No. 3 (November 1965), pp. 206–222) are false as stated. The theorems become true if we replace the weak hypothesis (6.1) with the stronger hypothesis (6.3).
