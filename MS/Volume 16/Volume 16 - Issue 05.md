## 1. On Linear Programming in a Markov Decision Problem
### Author(s):
- Eric V. Denardo
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
This paper treats a Markov decision problem with an infinite planning horizon and no discounting. This model is analyzed by application, perhaps repeated, of a simple linear program.

## 2. Integer Programming Via Modular Representations
### Author(s):
- Robert Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
Modular representations of the integers are used to identify the successive integer grid points encountered as one varies the objective value of an all-integer programming problem. One can, therefore, proceed from a noninteger solution to an integer solution by monotonic variation of the objective value. Ordinarily, it is necessary to perturb the objective function of a problem to fit the prescribed format for the algorithm: although this is easily done for small problems, the limited number of digits carried by most computing machines prevents it for problems with many variables. The features of the algorithm are virtually independent of the number and the linearity (or nonlinearity) of the constraints, provided the variables are constrained to be nonnegative and bounded above.

## 3. On Sequencing n Jobs on One Machine to Minimize the Number of Late Jobs
### Author(s):
- William L. Maxwell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
An integer programming formulation for the problem of sequencing jobs on a single machine to minimize the number of late jobs is developed. The structure of the formulation is exploited to obtain the easily stated algorithm (previously developed by Moore [5]) for the solution of the problem and then to compare it to other similar allocation problems, among which is the Knapsack problem.

## 6. Some Results for Bulk-Arrival Queues with State-Dependent Service Times
### Author(s):
- Carl M. Harris
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
The Poisson bulk-arrival single-channel first-come-first-served queuing system is generalized so that the service times are conditioned on the length of the queue at the moment service is begun. Some general theory is developed for the model, and three specific cases are explored. For each of the examples, results are obtained that characterize queue behavior using the imbedded-Markov-chain approach. Included in these results are tables of steady-state probabilities and expected queue sizes for numerous combinations of the parameters.

## 7. A Branch Search Algorithm for the Knapsack Problem
### Author(s):
- Harold Greenberg
- Robert L. Hegerich
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for the solution of the knapsack problem. The method involves searching the nodes of a tree along a single branch at a time. The algorithm eliminates the computational drawbacks inherent in the usual branch and bound schemes.

## 8. A Method for Solving the Indefinite Quadratic Programming Problem
### Author(s):
- Raymond K. Mueller
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
A method is developed for obtaining a solution to the quadratic programming problem with an indefinite quadratic objective function. A search procedure using gradient projection is the core of the method. However at each step an alternate direction to gradient projection is proposed and two methods are given to continue after the revised gradient projection procedure terminates. Although convergence to the solution is not guaranteed, good results were obtained for fifty-seven problems used to test the method.

## 9. Employment Smoothing (Capital Accumulation) with Production for Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of periodically choosing production quantity and manufacturing capacity with the latter constraining the former. It is assumed that capacity can be altered at a cost that is proportional to the amount of change and that other capacity costs are proportional to the capacity. Other manufacturing costs are assumed to be proportional to the quantity manufactured. We summarise inventory costs with a convex expected holding and penalty cost function; excess demand is backlogged. The model includes a (possibly) random change in capacity (labor force attrition or depreciation of capital) each period. We characterize optimal policies when the criterion is the minimization of expected discounted costs. The characterizations also apply when the unit costs of capacity change are stochastic with a known distribution that may be correlated in any period with the demand in the preceding period.

## 10. A Class of Inside-Out Algorithms for General Programs
### Author(s):
- F. J. Gould
### Published:

### Abstract:
In this paper the Fiacco-McCormick SUMT technique is embedded in a class of inside-out algorithms. Convergence is demonstrated for the nonlinear programming problem under fairly general conditions and the algorithms are interpreted in a geometric structure.

## 11. Cash Flows in Networks
### Author(s):
- A. H. Russell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
The concept of maximising present value is applied to the timing of activities in a network. The mathematical form of the problem is that of maximising a nonlinear function subject to linear constraints and can be solved as a succession of linear programmes. By application of duality principles the problem can be treated as a form of maximum value flow problem in which discounted cash flows are distributed along arcs from pay events to receipt events. The solution is aided by the “equilibrium theorem” of dual linear programming in that in the optimum condition flows occur only along arcs whose corresponding activity has zero float. The flows which occur in the optimally scheduled solution are directly proportional to the marginal cost which would be incurred by lengthening the activity corresponding to the arc along which the flow occurs. Some implications derived from the model are discussed and a number of possible applications are proposed.

## 12. A Decomposition Method for Interval Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Adi Ben-Israel
- Philip D. Robers
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
An interval linear program is
where the matrix A, vectors b−, b+, and c are given. If A has full row rank, the optimal solutions of (IP) can be written explicitly (A. Ben-Israel and A. Charnes: “An explicit solution of a special class of linear programming problems,” Operations Research16 (1968), 1166–1175). This result is used in conjunction with the Danteig-Wolfe decomposition principle to develop a finite iterative technique for solving the general (IP). Since any bounded linear program may be cast in form (IP) the technique may also be considered as an alternative method for linear programming.

## 13. Generalized Networks, Generalized Upper Bounding and Decomposition of the Convex Simplex Method
### Author(s):
- David P. Rutenberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1970
### Abstract:
If the constraint matrix of a linear program has special structure it may be possible to speed computation. Techniques have been developed to take advantage of such special structures as generalized networks, generalized upper bounding, and decomposition. For these matrix structures, it is shown in this paper how to extend the techniques to Zangwill's mathematical programming algorithm, the convex simplex method.
