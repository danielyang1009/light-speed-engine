## 3. Utility Measurement in Public Health Decision Making
### Author(s):
- David H. Stembon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
The Churchman-Ackoff approximate measure of value method was used successfully to measure the utilities of objectives of decision makers in a large public health agency. The utilities thus obtained formed part of a model of a resource allocation problem faced by the agency in its role as allocator of a federal grant. A comparison of the normative solution derived from the model with the solution already decided upon by the agency tended to support the hypothesis that the members of the agency chose among alternatives as if they were maximizing expected utility.

## 4. On the Choice of Risk Levels in Managerial Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- B. L. Myers
- A. J. Melcher
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper was to develop a set of factors which would enable one to answer questions regarding specific alpha and beta values, whether they should be large or small errors, and to what kinds of decisions are these errors related. The set of factors found useful in thinking through the difficulties encountered are: 1) number of alternatives, 2) planning horizon, 3) past success of decision-maker, and 4) cost-revenue consequences of an action.

## 5. The Impact of Cybernetic Information Technology on Management Value Systems
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Ericson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
The first three sections of the paper are background discussions of relevant types of value questions. First, we consider the historical evolution of managerial value conflict, as they are rooted in a fundamental value polarisation reflected in U. S. society. Then we relate management values to environmental values, especially in the corporate context. Finally, we review contemporary analyses of the bases of general value systems, and consider their relationship to current research in management value systems.

## 6. The Effect of Reducing Leadtime on Inventory Levels-Simulation Analysis
### Author(s):
- Donald Gross
- A. Soriano
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
The allowed safety stock level reduction and accompanying reduction in average on-shelf inventory level are evaluated, for prescribed system performance requirements, as a function of mean leadtime reduction. The general simulation technique developed for this purpose allows the treatment of the s, S periodic review inventory problem with both demands and leadtime being stochastic. Some results obtained for a military supply system, where the reduction in leadtime is achieved by resorting to airlift rather than sealift, are presented. In addition, generalizations as to the effect of certain parameters on the reductions allowable for general situations are given. Finally, a simplified means of predicting these effects by an empirical method is indicated.

## 7. An Unequal-Period Model for Cash Management Decisions
### Author(s):
- Yair E. Orgler
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
A lack of synchronization between cash inflows and outflows presents the problem of investing positive net flows and financing negative net flows. In addition to the basic investment-financing issue there are other interrelated problems such as the payment schedule and the minimal cash balance that directly affect cash management decisions. Previous attempts to solve these problems have imposed constraints that limit their application. The purpose of this study is to develop an applicable method for solving the cash management problem by deriving a linear programming model that is divided into unequal periods. The unequal time division maintains the day-to-day aspect of the problem while reducing the number of periods and variables to a manageable size. Decision variables are divided into four groups: the payment schedule, securities transactions, short-term financing, and the cash balance. The model determines the optimal values of these variables subject to institutional constraints and within a framework of managerial risk preferences that are expressed as subjective constraints and subsequently evaluated by the dual model. Although a certainty assumption is made, inputs are analysed by sensitivity analysis and the dual model, while the effects of uncertainty are further reduced by the unequal time structure of the model. Tests of the model indicate that it is both profitable and generally applicable by most business firms.

## 8. Sequential Decision Problems: A Model to Exploit Existing Forecasters
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
A sequential decision problem is partitioned into two parts: a stochastic model describing the transition probability density function of the state variable, and a separate framework of decision choices and payoffs. If a particular sequential decision problem is a recurring one, then there may often exist human forecasters who generate quantitative forecasts at each decision stage. In those eases where construction of a mathematical model for predictive purposes is difficult, we may consider using the forecasts and forecast revisions provided by the existing forecasting mechanism as the state variable. The paper considers a specific class of problems in which improved forecasts of some unknown quantity are available before each decision stage. A small number of actual forecasters are studied through analysis of historical data to see whether the data-generating process for forecast changes is quasi-Markovian. The data are generally, although not entirely, consistent with the hypothesis that ratios of successive forecasts are independent variates; their distribution appears to be conditionally Lognormal. Some possible reasons for these results are explored. In cases where the hypothesis holds, a dynamic programming approach to the sequential decision problem may be used to provide optimal decision rules. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated with a numerical example involving crop planning, and the example is extended to explore the effects of using the methodology when the required assumptions do not hold.

## 9. A Constrained Choice Model for Student Housing
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Crandall
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
Traditionally, a university will formulate its policies for student housing on a short-run basis, adjusting its plans for residence hall and other on-campus housing from time to time to meet expected crises in the next few years ahead. In addition, university policy making in this field has tended to center around on-campus housing, neglecting the often substantial role played—or capable of being played—by the private market.

## 10. Applying Linear Programming to the Design of Ultimate Pit Limits
### Author(s):
- Manfred Meyer
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1969
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of a Linear Programming model in open pit mine evaluation. The primary conditions to be incorporated into the model are the course and the inclination of the ore vein, and, during the whole life of the mine, safe slope angles to be maintained. Subject to this the objective of running a mine is assumed to be maximizing the direct operating profits which consist of proceeds from the sale of ore minus direct operating cost of extraction, transportation, and upgrading. First the Linear Programming model is developed, and subsequently some computational aspects are treated.
