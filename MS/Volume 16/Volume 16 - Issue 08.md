## 2. Models and Managers: The Concept of a Decision Calculus
### Author(s):
- John D. C. Little
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
A manager tries to put together the various resources under his control into an activity that achieves his objectives. A model of his operation can assist him but probably will not unless it meets certain requirements. A model that is to be used by a manager should be simple, robust, easy to control, adaptive, as complete as possible, and easy to communicate with. By simple is meant easy to understand; by robust, hard to get absurd answers from; by easy to control, that the user knows what input data would be required to produce desired output answers; adaptive means that the model can be adjusted as new information is acquired; completeness implies that important phenomena will be included even if they require judgmental estimates of their effect; and, finally, easy to communicate with means that the manager can quickly and easily change inputs and obtain and understand the outputs.

## 3. Optimizing the Search for Cost Deviation Sources
### Author(s):
- Joel S. Demski
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
The typical statistical cost control model determines when a cost deviation is significant, but does not determine the optimum search procedure for restoring the process to a state of control. This search procedure is important because any given cost deviation may be the result of a number of individual causes and each cause requires different search activity. A model is developed (and subsequently extended) for determining the optimum sequence in which to examine the various possible causes.

## 4. Optimal Political Districting by Implicit Enumeration Techniques
### Author(s):
- R. S. Garfinkel
- G. L. Nemhauser
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
An algorithm is given which finds all optimal solutions, for a given set of criteria, to political redistricting problems. Using “population units” as indivisible elements, the first phase generates all feasible districts, where feasibility indicates contiguity, compactness and limited population deviation. The second phase finds that set of M feasible districts which “covers” each population unit exactly once, and minimizes the maximum deviation of any district population from the mean district population. Computational results indicate that states with 40 counties or fewer can be solved in less than 10 minutes on an IBM 7094. However, our attempt to solve a 55 county state was unsuccessful.

## 5. Optimal Inventory Policies in Perturbed Demand Models
### Author(s):
- B. L. Schwartz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
Investigation is continued of inventory models in which customer good will is lost when stockout occurs. Several models are formulated and optimal policies for the firm are derived conceptually (i.e., algebraic equations satisfied by the optimal parameter values are determined). Both constant and distributed demand are considered, and it is shown that the same formulation applies to both.

## 6. The Credit Granting Decision
### Author(s):
- Harold Bierman, Jr.
- Warren H. Hausman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
A series of probabilistic models are formulated for the credit granting policy of a firm. First, a single-period analysis is presented for the two-action problem, “give credit or do not give credit.” Then a multi-period analysis for the same problem is presented, showing that the single-period analysis ignores important future benefits. The multi-period analysis contains a Bayesian approach to revisions of the probability of collection as collection experience is gained. The multi-period analysis is modified by adding discounting to reflect the time value of money and a probability that the customer will cease purchasing. Next, a dynamic programming formulation of the multi-period problem is presented, and this formulation is then adapted to include a decision on how much credit to offer. The paper closes with a series of remarks concerning the practical application of the analysis.

## 7. Adaptive Limits in Inventory Control
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
- Joseph Elmaleh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
In conventional reorder policies for inventory control, stocks are allowed to fluctuate between two prescribed limits: a lower limit corresponding to a safety stock to guard against runouts, and an upper limit to which the stock is replenished from time to time. Methods have been suggested for computing optimal upper and lower limits for the case of stationary demand patterns.

## 8. A Simulation Model for Harvest Operations under Stochastic Conditions
### Author(s):
- Eric E. Sorensen
- James F. Gilheany
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1970
### Abstract:
The scheduled allocation of resources for large-scale harvesting operations is vulnerable to delays caused by variables of a stochastic nature such as rainfall and equipment breakdown. A computer simulation model was developed to test the merits of different harvesting strategies and decision rules on a sugar cane plantation. The model takes into account weather, hauling, equipment logistics, and equipment breakdowns. For a given man-machine harvest strategy and harvest schedule, it will simulate assigning harvest units (men and equipment) to fields, harvesting the cane, hauling the cane to mills, and milling. Submodels, based on a statistical analysis of historical data, generate values of simulated daily rain in each field, equipment breakdown, and repair times. Harvesting delays occur when the simulated rain reaches critical values. The hauling and milling capacity in the model depends to a great extent on both current and previous rainfall and is updated when required for new field conditions brought about by rain. The model keeps account of each cane-hauler round trip (some 50,000 trips a year) from field to mill, causes the haulers to queue when the loader or unloader is busy, and sends them to a repair shop when damaged. Simulated work hours and labor practices are also included in the model. For example, a submodel calls for overtime when progress indicates that the harvest may extend into the rainy season. The model gives periodic reports on the simulated production and information on capacity requirements for many of the tasks within the harvest operation.
