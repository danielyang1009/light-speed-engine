## 1. Free for All—Corporate Models: The State of the Art
### Author(s):
- George W. Gershefski
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
By the early 1960's operations research models had reached the stage of development where they were being applied to some of the basic operations of a company such as inventory management, scheduling and resource allocation.

## 2. Free for All—Factors Making for Implementation Success and Failure
### Author(s):
- Allan Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
The gap between brilliant management science solutions and the translation of these solutions into practical and profitable management action has, of course, long been recognized. Certainly TIMS has been concerned about this problem since the organization was founded.

## 3. Letter to the Editor—A Model of Business-Society
### Author(s):
- William T. Moran
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
A business enterprise in a microcosmic society—and a good enough model for experiments in operating society. It must maintain a fine balance between (A) stable and efficient operation within the present rules of the game and (B) exploration, change and growth—the anticipation or creation of tomorrow's rules.

## 4. Work Flow Structure: An Analysis for Planning and Control
### Author(s):
- William K. Holstein
- William L. Berry
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
This paper has two purposes: (1) to propose a new way of conceptualizing job-shop-like manufacturing systems and (2) to suggest how this conceptualization might be applied in the development of planning and control procedures. The concept of “work flow structure” is developed and methods for determining this structure from a sample of job routings or a routing transition matrix are described. Two key notions used to define work flow structure are “paths” of work flow and the relative activity levels or throughput volumes of processing units in the system. Sample results are presented from the application of these methods to data from a large machine shop. The final section of the paper suggests a number of ways in which work flow structure information might be used in procedures for production planning and control. The application areas discussed include product mix planning, capacity planning, personnel assignment, work releasing and dispatching.

## 5. Organizational Archetypes of a Multi-National Company
### Author(s):
- David P. Rutenberg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
Decision premises, within which plans are made, should be formulated with an eye to the organization that will implement the results. This assertion seems especially relevant for multi-national companies which consist of a headquarters with subsidiaries around the globe. Four archetypes of the relationship between a headquarters and its subsidiaries are presented. These are based on theory developed by Leavitt (executive-workers), and Churchman and Schainblatt (analyst-manager). Each archetype is developed by using existing literature to explore patterns of bounded rationality that would emerge in different organizational structures. After an example of a corporation illustrative of the archetype, appropriate planning guidelines are presented for investment discount rates, pricing policy, product design, planned managerial rotation, and liquid asset management.

## 6. Real-Time Information Systems: A Comparative Economic Analysis
### Author(s):
- William M. Zani
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
There are several generally accepted suppositions concerning the cost and benefits of real-time information systems. These suppositions expect that real-time systems can generate sufficient benefits to offset the higher costs of processing relative to traditional batch processing systems. The objective of this study was to examine in actual operating environments the generally accepted notions of costs and benefits of real-time systems that were supplied by a computer utility. These suppositions were examined by analyzing the empirical data of six matched firms. The cost and benefits of the information systems of three companies which used a computer utility real-time system were compared to the costs and benefits of three similar companies which used private batch processing systems. The findings of the research were the reverse of expectations. The data analysis strongly suggested that the real-time information did not produce any significant information benefits, but that the real-time data processing costs were less than the comparative batch data processing costs. The primary reason the results differed from expectations is that the real-time information was not fruitfully used. The findings of the study suggest that real-time information system benefits are not gained automatically, but can be achieved only if the systems are meaningfully integrated into the management process.

## 7. Effect of Three Voting Rules on Resource Allocation Decisions
### Author(s):
- Jacob G. Birnberg
- Louis R. Pondy
- C. Lee Davis
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the effect of the voting rule adopted by a capital budgeting committee on the allocation of resources among divisions. The results of a laboratory experiment indicate that different voting rules have different characteristics measured in terms of the size of the total budget allocation made and the inter division variability. In addition, an attempt is made to ascertain the techniques followed within the groups to reach a decision. None of the four models offered provides an adequate explanation of the observed behavior. However, a mixed model consisting of two of the approaches does provide a reasonable explanation for the observed behavior.

## 8. Printing Press Scheduling for Multi-Edition Periodicals
### Author(s):
- Samuel Gorenstein
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
The problem of scheduling a printing press for a periodical with several editions, so as to minimize the costs, is discussed. A mixed-integer program is formulated which includes most of the costs and constraints, but it is not solvable for problem sizes of practical interests. A heuristic method, based on the traveling salesman problem, is proposed. A sample computation is included.

## 9. A Markovian Model for Hospital Admission Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
Several queuing models suggested for modelling hospital admissions scheduling are reviewed and a Markovian decision model is presented. The resulting linear program could be solved to obtain results listed on a decision table as a guide to administrative action.

## 10. The Use of Regression on Dummy Variables in Management Research
### Author(s):
- S. R. Searle
- Jon G. Udell
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
Studies of organizational behavior and other managerial phenomena frequently include variables which are not readily measurable by cardinal or ratio scales. Variables of this nature occur, for example, when investigating the relationship between a supervisor's span of control and (i) dissimilarity of subordinate's jobs, (ii) supervision received from other executives, (iii) geographic concentration of subordinates, and (iv) personal assistants. The (0, 1) variable technique, explained and illustrated here in terms of this example, offers the researcher a superior analysis for those sociological, psychological, and managerial phenomena for which no metric has yet been developed. The authors believe that this is one of the most useful statistical techniques available to the management scientist.

## 13. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1970
### Abstract:
A large number of programs are available commercially that do a wide variety of jobs. Unfortunately, there is no single, all-inclusive abstracting service which describes all of these programs. We are currently using two services, the Business Software Information Service (288 Park Avenue West, Elmhurst, Illinois), and a service by Systems Interaction Corporation (8 West 40th Street, New York, New York 10018). Besides that, we keep an index on 3 × 5 cards of abstracts and advertisements which appear in the literature.
