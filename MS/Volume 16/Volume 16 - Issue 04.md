## 2. What is a Decision?
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1969
### Abstract:
The decision process is described as a series of steps, starting with information output and analysis and culminating in resolution, namely a selection from several available alternatives. Various aspects of rationality in decision making are reviewed and the concept of personalistic versus impersonalistic choice is discussed. It is suggested that with time management control tends to involve an increasing number of formal procedures and thereby to become more impersonalistic in character.

## 3. An Optimization Model of Tuberculosis Epidemiology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1969
### Abstract:
The problems of management of tuberculosis in developing nations are studied utilizing the tools of systems analysis. The tuberculosis system consists of interacting components which are the “states of nature” of the disease. The interaction of these components determine the future state of the disease. Controls in the form of therapy, vaccinations or prophylaxis may be superimposed on the natural processes, thus altering the future course of the disease. A descriptive mathematical model describing the flows between the various categories is used to predict the trends both with and without intervention. An optimization model is derived from the descriptive model under the assumption that a program of reduction of active cases has been specified. The optimization model selects the forms of control which achieve the specified reduction program at least cost. Optimization is accomplished via linear programming.

## 4. Computational Analysis of Scoring Models for R and D Project Selection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1969
### Abstract:
Several authors have proposed using scoring models for prescriptive analysis of the R and D project selection decision problem. This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements. For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores. The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores. Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of a scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model. Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings.

## 7. A Performer-Oriented Approach to Systems Quality
### Author(s):
- Ronald Lessing
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1969
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to present a means of modeling the quality characteristics of a large class of systems. The proposed models depend upon the use of a state variable to describe the quality level at various points in the system and upon, transition matrices to describe the error-producing and error-detecting characteristics of the individual servers and machines that compose the system. Applications of the model to linear, cyclic, and branching systems are developed in detail. Ultimately the model may be used to optimize the number, type, and location of quality control components or to optimize the performance of systems operating under risk.

## 8. The Influence of Setup Time on Job Shop Performance
### Author(s):
- Jon K. Wilbrecht
- William B. Prescott
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1969
### Abstract:
A job shop was simulated in order to determine the effect of different job priority rules involving setup times on shop performance. The seven priority rules tested were chosen on the basis that they could be implemented by job shop foremen. Assumptions in the simulation model were based on experience with an electronics company and published literature. The study indicates that, for a fully loaded shop, giving priority to be the job with the shortest actual setup time, regardless of its run time, gives the best overall performance result.
