## 1. Information Processing and Programmed Decision Systems
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Kriebel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
The capacity to evaluate decisions and information within a unified analytical model of the firm is at best a complex task. Even if, for the sake of simplicity, we ignore the effects of human behavior within organizations, most research on information processing design and evaluation has sought simulation in lieu of an explicit mathematical model.

## 2. Plant Location with Generalized Search Origin
### Author(s):
- Kurt Spielberg
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
There exists computational experience to the effect that search algorithms of the type introduced by Balas are frequently ineffective because of being tied to a rigid “natural” search origin. In this paper the dynamic relocation of the search origin to possibly more appropriate points is advocated. Details of such a procedure are given for the Simple Plant Location Problem. Computational improvements of, sometimes, a striking nature are presented.

## 3. Preferences, Summation, and Social Welfare Functions
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
This paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the following proposition, in which ⪯ and ⪯i for i = 1,…, n are weak orders on a finite set X. There are real-valued functions f1, f2,…, fn on X such that, for all x and y in X and i in {1,…,n}x⪯iy if and only if fi(x) ≤ fi(y), and x ⪯ y if and only if fl(x) + ⋯ + fn(x) ≤ fl(y) + ⋯ + fn(y). The condition can be viewed as an extension of a simple unanimity or dominance condition.

## 4. A Note to the Problem of Convergence of Periodic Reinvestments
### Author(s):
- Jindřich Černohorský
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to show the mathematical treatment of the problem of periodic reinvestments by an amount equal to depreciation different from one which was given in [3]. It enables us to obtain further results concerning the convergence of the above mentioned process and in the simplest case (n = 2) to discuss the optimal choice of depreciation vector.

## 5. Production Smoothing with Stochastic Demand I: Finite Horizon Case
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
Beckmann [1] and Mills [7] consider production smoothing problems in which demands are random variables. This paper generalizes and extends Beckmann's results which predicate backlogging of excess demand. Convex expected holding and penalty cost functions pertain to inventory and the cost of changing the production rate is proportional to the change. The model has a finite horizon and permits nonstationary costs and demand distributions. Beckmann shows that two curves in the plane determine an optimal policy (minimum expected discounted cost) each period. It is shown here that the curves have slopes between minus one and zero, are differentiable, and are bounded by two straight lines with a slope of minus one. The results are not changed by an upper bound on the quantity produced or by a lag between the time a product is manufactured and the time it is available to satisfy demand.

## 6. On Optimum Stochastic Allocation
### Author(s):
- Allen Klinger
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
Analytic results involving the optimum return and strategy functions of an inventory allocation problem are presented. The problem requires that a number of randomly functioning units be apportioned among randomly many points to maximize the probability that at least one unit functions at each point. The maximum probability function has been shown often, but not always, to be a monotonic non-increasing function of the number of units. When it is monotonic nonincreasing, it is proven here that the ratio improvement of maximum probability is a decreasing function of the number of units. When the ratio is only nonincreasing, it is proven1 here that the strategy is a monotonic nonincreasing function of the number of units. The theoretical results relate to the management use of increment and ratio measures of effectiveness and to properties of the optimum allocation strategy.

## 7. Optimal Production, Investment, Advertising, and Price Controls for the Dynamic Monopoly Firm
### Author(s):
- Russell G. Thompson
- Michael S. Proctor
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
In this paper, a dynamic continuous time model, encompassing operations, investments, output prices, informative advertising, and brand advertising, is formulated as an optimal control problem in an activity analysis context. In the model, the objective of the firm is to maximise, subject to various constraints, the discounted value of accumulated savings over the finite decision-making interval plus the discounted value of capacity at the end of the interval. The state variables are capacity, goodwill of type 1 reflecting informative advertising, goodwill of type 2 reflecting brand advertising, net debt, and the output price. The controls are the scale of operation, the purchase of new capacity, informative advertising, brand advertising, and the rate of change of the output price. Final capacity, goodwill of types 1 and 2, net debt, and price are control parameters. There are several inequality constraints.

## 8. Minimum Variance and Optimal Asymptotic Portfolios
### Author(s):
- Samuel H. Bickel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
By taking the goal of optimal portfolio management as long term maximization of wealth, whether it be via long or short term gains, portfolio selection can be based upon objective criteria instead of risk preference. In this paper we wish to relate these optimum long run or asymptotic portfolios to the set of efficient portfolios. The case of statistically identical securities is presented in detail with attention given to the effect of mutual correlation on the optimal size of the portfolio. Circumstances are discussed for which such popular policies as short term trend following and intermediate term dollar averaging are optimal in the long run. Since portfolio management can be interpreted as a problem within the framework of multistage decision process of stochastic type, further insight into optimal policies could be developed from examination of dynamic programming theory.

## 9. A Queueing Process with Some Discrimination
### Author(s):
- Meckinley Scott
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the analysis of a queueing process involving two classes of customers where the arrival mechanism of each class is subject to a particular control doctrine based on the queue length. Expressions are obtained for the equilibrium distribution of the queue length, the expected queue length and other characteristics which measure the effectiveness of the control doctrine.

## 10. A Queueing Reward System with Several Customer Classes
### Author(s):
- Bruce L. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
This paper considers an n-server queueing system with m customer classes distinguished by the reward associated with serving customers of that class. Our objective is to accept or reject customers so as to maximize the expected value of the rewards received over an infinite planning horizon. By making the assumptions of Poisson arrivals and a common exponential service time this problem can be formulated as an infinite horizon continuous time Markov decision problem. In §3 we customize the general algorithm for solving continuous time Markov decision problems to our queueing model. In §4 we obtain qualitative results about the form of the optimal policy. §6 reports the results of simulation tests which compare heuristic policies for our model when the service times associated with each customer class have arbitrary distributions. The “winning” policy is based on a rather intricate theorem whose proof comprises §5.

## 11. Probability Bounds in Replacement Policies for Markov Systems
### Author(s):
- Avraham Beja
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
The precise costs of operating a stationary finite Markov system are assumed undefined. It is only known that the cost of failure is orders of magnitude higher than the cost of replacement, and that all other costs are relatively negligible. The problem considered is the maximisation of the expected length of time between replacements subject to bounds on the average hazard throughout the remaining part of the replacement cycle whenever the system is not replaced. The solution is shown to be a unique pure strategy, and a computation algorithm is presented which constitutes an extension of Howard's policy iteration principle to considerations of feasibility. A sensitivity analysis indicates the range of the cost parameters under which the same solution would be optimal for a standard minimum-cost problem. The two approaches thus appear to be essentially equivalent.

## 12. Communication to the Editor—A General Planning Model
### Author(s):
- J. F. Brotchie
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
A general econometric model for allocation of a set of activities to a set of spaces is proposed. Potential applications include engineering and economic planning at various levels from national, regional and urban development to industrial and building layouts and chemical or electronic systems design. Scheduling problems may also be handled. Current applications are to urban planning, hospital layouts, and building design.

## 13. Communication to the Editor—The Use of Subjective Probability Estimates in Assessing Project Completion Times
### Author(s):
- J. B. Kidd
- J. R. Morgan
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1969
### Abstract:
The conclusion from this analysis supports King's [King, W. R., T. A. Wilson. 1967. Subjective time estimates in critical path planning—A preliminary analysis. Management Sci.13(5, January) 307–320.] main point that there is little evidence of learning (i.e. improvement in the accuracy of estimates) in the period before work starts. There are, however, some differences. In this situation, more changes in estimates are made before work starts than reported by King. This is perhaps not surprising since King's analysis refers to new construction, which can perhaps be specified more clearly in advance, rather than the maintenance work which we are concerned.
