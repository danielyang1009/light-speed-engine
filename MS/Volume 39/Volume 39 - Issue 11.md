## 1. Leadership Style and Incentives
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We study the relationship between a firm's environment and its optimal leadership style. We use a model in which contracts between the firm and managers are incomplete so that providing incentives to subordinates is not straightforward. Leadership style, whether based on organizational culture or on the personality of the leader, then affects the incentive contracts that can be offered to subordinates. We show that leaders who empathize with their employees adopt a participatory style and that shareholders gain from appointing such leaders when the firm has the potential for exploiting numerous innovative ideas. By contrast, when the environment is poor in new ideas, shareholders benefit from hiring a more selfish (i.e., more profit maximizing) leader whose style is more autocratic.

## 2. High-Definition Television: Assessing Demand Forecasts for a Next Generation Consumer Durable
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
High-Definition Television promises to be the next generation of television. This technology has broad implications for consumer markets, as well as the underlying manufacturing, technology development, and R&D activities of firms. Under increasing pressure from various groups, the U.S. government must make major policy and funding decisions based on its assessment of the likely demand for HDTV. Three published reports which forecast sales of HDTV after its scheduled introduction in the mid-1990s are available. Unfortunately, these forecasts offer widely differing perspectives on HDTV's potential. This paper presents an approach that links product segmentation (based on historical demand parameters, and marketing and manufacturing related variables) and demand forecasting for new products. The published HDTV forecasts are then assessed using this segmentation scheme. Differing from the Congressional Budget Office's earlier evaluation, this analysis indicates that one report is consistent with historical data from the home appliance industry.

## 3. Direct Estimation of Synergy: A New Approach to the Diversity-Performance Debate
### Author(s):
- Rachel Davis

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
This study examines the linkages between relatedness and synergy in the context of diversification among U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the period 19601980. Rather than assume (as in the entropy, Herfindahl and concentric indices of diversification) that the levels of synergy generated by different related combinations of business units are identical, we estimate synergy directly using a modified version of the concentric index. In addition to estimating synergy using capital market performance of the firm as a whole, we examine the effects of nondrug diversification on the innovative productivity of firms' pharmaceutical divisions alone.

## 4. Structural Properties and a Heuristic for Kanban-Controlled Serial Lines
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
Kanban-controlled serial manufacturing systems have been popular in Japan for many years. The analytical intractibility of such systems makes simulation and heuristics essential in studying them. In this paper we develop some theoretical resultsreversibility and dominancethat characterize the dynamics of these systems, provide insight into their behavior and help greatly reduce the simulation effort needed to study them. These structural results also provide the basis for developing heuristics to deal effectively with particular cases. Reversibility deals with certain permutations of the machines; dominance deals with the allocation of kanbans to cells. In addition, we show that if our goal is to maximize the throughput with a given total fixed number of cards, all of the machines should be placed in a single cell. These structural results hold in general because no assumptions are made on the processing time distribution of the machines, the number of cells, the total number of kanbans, or whether or not the machines are identical. Based on the structural results, we also develop a heuristic for the allocation of kanbans to a balanced line. We briefly describe an implementation of this model at a laminate manufacturing plant.

## 5. Use of Piecewise Linear Value Functions in Interactive Multicriteria Decision Support: A Monte Carlo Study
### Author(s):
- Theodor J. Stewart
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
This paper describes a Monte Carlo study conducted to evaluate the effects of modelling assumptions and design parameters on the behaviour of interactive methods for the discrete choice MCDM problem, based on explicit value function models. The purpose of the study is to identify those assumptions and parameters which lead to the most efficient use of preference judgements made by the decision maker, and to the greatest robustness to judgmental errors. It is concluded that nonlinearities in the value function need to be modelled, achieved here by use of a piecewise linear form. It was also found that search for indifference points, rather than using simple preference judgements alone, is of great advantage, best realized by expressing judgements in terms of pairwise trade-offs. Methods incorporating these features are highly robust to judgmental errors. Interactive methods of this class are compared with a priori fitting of similar value functions, and found to give a very similar quality of solution.

## 6. Inconsistent Trade-Offs Between Attributes: New Evidence in Preference Assessment Biases
### Author(s):
- Philippe Delqui
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
One of the fundamental postulates of rational choice is that preferences manifested by an individual towards alternatives should only depend on the merits of these alternatives and not on extraneous, irrelevant factors. Violations of this basic principle, so-called preference reversals, have puzzled researchers for over twenty years and raised concerns about the use of preference modeling in decision analysis. The present work seeks to further determine the nature of these phenomena, in particular the role played by response mode in certain types of preference reversals. Hershey and Schoemaker (1985) found Probability and Certainty Equivalents to differ systematically and attributed this difference to a framing effect. Here, we generalize their experimental design to control for framing effects and study biases on a larger scope. Our results show that biases do not disappear in the absence of framing, instead they reveal a clear and pervasive bias occurring under more controlled experimental conditions than previously known: direct trade-offs between two attributes X and Y are biased depending on whether X is traded off against Y, or Y traded off against X. From among several hypotheses, the data lend support to the general principle of compatibility (Tversky et al. 1988; Slovic et al. 1990), which implies that an attribute receives more relative weight when it is used as currency in trading off.

## 7. The Effects of Incentive Compensation Contracts on the Risk and Return Performance of Commodity Trading Advisors
### Author(s):
- Joseph H. Golec
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
This paper shows that commodity trading advisors' (CTAs) investment performance may be partially explained by their incentive compensation contracts. Contracts include base, incentive and asset parameters. The relationships between contract parameters and performance are theoretically indeterminate but are examined here empirically. Results indicate that incentive parameters are positively related to return means and standard deviations. The dollar amounts of assets CTAs manage are negatively related to return means and standard deviations, supporting Elton et al.'s (1987, 1989) finding that CTA performance falls after public offerings of commodity funds. Intuitively, since dollar fees are a function of assets, at the higher asset and fee levels achieved through commodity fund offerings, CTAs may safeguard assets and fees by pursuing less risky investment strategies.

## 8. The Effect of a Large Shareholder on Corporate Value
### Author(s):
- Steven Huddart
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
This article analyzes the value of a corporation as a function of its ownership structure. Shareholders can acquire costly information about the manager's effort to produce output. Concentrating share ownership leads the largest shareholder to (i) acquire more precise signals of effort and (ii) modify the compensation contract. Better monitoring increases output, and hence firm value. However, the (risk averse) large shareholder bears more idiosyncratic firm risk as his stake in the firm increases. These forces equilibrate at a unique welfare maximizing ownership structure. Under a strong condition on the purchase or sale of shares by large stockholders, investors have incentives to trade toward the ownership structure that maximizes the social surplus. When all investors are price takers only a diffuse ownership structure can arise in a competitive equilibrium.

## 9. Stochastic Dedication: Designing Fixed Income Portfolios Using Massively Parallel Benders Decomposition
### Author(s):
- Randall S. Hiller
- Jonathan Eckstein
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1993
### Abstract:
Drawing on recent developments in discrete time fixed income options theory, we propose a stochastic programming procedure, which we call stochastic dedication, for managing asset/liability portfolios with interest rate contingent claims. The model uses scenario generation to combine deterministic dedication techniques with stochastic duration matching methods, and provides the portfolio manager with a risk/return Pareto optimal frontier from which a portfolio may be selected based on individual risk attitudes. We employ a fixed income risk metric that can be interpreted as the fair market value of a collection of interest rate options that eliminates bankruptcy risk from the asset/liability portfolio. We incorporate this metric into a risk/return stochastic optimization model, using a binomial lattice sampling procedure to construct interest rate paths and cash flow streams from an arbitrage-free term structure model. The resulting parametric linear program has a particularly simple subproblem structure, and we have been able to solve it using resource-directed decomposition on a massively parallel computer system, the Connection Machine CM-2. We take a novel approach that uses a standard serial simplex method to solve the master problem, but generates scenarios and Benders cuts in a massively parallel manner. We discuss the performance of this implementation and present the results for a simple pension fund immunization problem.
