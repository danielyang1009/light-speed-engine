## 1. Growth-Security Investment Strategy for Long and Short Runs
### Author(s):
- Yuming Li
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
It is well known that the investment policy maximizing the expected logarithm of wealth each period is a long-run optimal capital growth criterion. However, the growth-optimal strategy entails a considerable risk of losing a substantial portion of wealth for the investment in the short run. This paper extends the long-run capital growth criterion to a multiperiod investment policy which maximizes the capital growth and at the same time achieves a given probability of maintaining an accumulated risk-free return over any finite investment horizon.

## 2. Portfolio Choices in the Presence of Other Risks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
The effects of multivariate risk are examined in a model of portfolio choice. The conditions under which portfolio choices are separable from consumption decisions are derived. Unless the appropriate restrictions hold on investors' preferences or on the probability distribution of risks, the optimal portfolio is affected by other risks. This requires generalizing the usual measures of risk aversion. With one risky asset, matrix measures of risk aversion are used to generalize the results of Arrow (1965) and Pratt (1964) concerning the effects of risk aversion and wealth on the optimal portfolio. With two risky assets, the choices made by two investors coincide if and only if their generalized risk-aversion measures are identical. Ross's notion of stronger risk aversion is then used to characterize the effect of risk aversion on the level of investment in the riskier asset.

## 3. The Effect of Attribute Ranges on Weights in Multiattribute Utility Measurements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
Multiattribute utility theory requires a specific relation between the range of outcomes of each attribute and the weight for that attribute. The greater the range, the greater the weight has to be. Experimental results show that subjects do not adjust their judgments properly if the range is varied. For the two methods tested the adjustment is smaller than required by theory. The bias was smaller for a regression procedure than for the direct ratio method. Weights based on an intuitive range were not found to be superior to those elicited over different ranges.

## 4. Diversification Under Supply Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Supply chain management is becoming an increasingly important issue, especially when in most industries the cost of materials purchased comprises 4060% of the total sales revenue. Despite the benefits cited for single sourcing in the popular literature, there is enough evidence of industries having two/three sources for most parts. In this paper we address the operational issue of quantity allocation between two uncertain suppliers and its effects on the inventory policies of the buyer. Based on the type of delivery contract a buyer has with the suppliers, we suggest three models for the supply process. Model I is a one-delivery contract with all of the order quantity delivered either in the current period with probability , or in the next period with probability 1  . Model II is also a one-delivery contract with a random fraction of the order quantity delivered in the current period; the portion of the order quantity not delivered is cancelled. Model III is similar to Model II with the remaining quantity delivered in the next period. We derive the optimal ordering policies that minimize the total ordering, holding and penalty costs with backlogging. We show that the optimal ordering policy in period n for each of these models is as follows: for x  n, order nothing; for vn  x < n, use only one supplier; and for x < vn, order from both suppliers. For the limiting case in the single period version of Model I, we derive conditions under which one would continue ordering from one or the other or both suppliers. For Model II, we give sufficient conditions for not using the second (more expensive) supplier when the demand and yield distributions have some special form. For the single period version of Models II and III with equal marginal ordering costs we show that the optimal order quantities follow a ratio rule when demand is exponential and yields are either normal or gamma distributed.

## 5. A Multiperiod Minimax Resource Allocation Problem with Substitutable Resources
### Author(s):
- Quynh C. Nguyen
- Richard E. Stone
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a multiperiod resource allocation model in which the resources are storable and substitutable. A specific application of this model relates to the multiperiod production planning for electronic circuit board assembly factories. In this case, resources are electronic components, which are storable, that is, excess components in one period can be used in subsequent periods. Components that can be used in the same function on a circuit board are considered substitutable. Substitutability between components, however, may be dependent upon the specific circuit board on which they reside. Given that there are certain production requirements for the circuit boards, and that some components are in short supply, our algorithm (a) revises the production levels of the affected circuit boards, and (b) efficiently allocates the available components according to the revised production, so as to minimize the maximum weighted deviation from the original production plans. The weights reflect the relative importance of the circuit boards. The objective function uses cumulative production levels and cumulative demands to allow for back-scheduling.

## 6. Characterizing the Output Process of a CONWIP Line with Deterministic Processing and Random Outages
### Author(s):

- Mark L. Spearman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
We model a CONWIP (CONstant Work-in-Process) production line with deterministic processing times and exponential failure and repair times as a closed queueing network. We derive an approximation for the mean and variance of the output during a specified interval and give computable conditions under which this approximation performs well. We show through empirical tests that the approximation is robust and illustrate its usefulness as the basis for a procedure for selecting an economic production quota and a card count for a CONWIP line.

## 7. Control-Variate Models of Common Random Numbers for Multiple Comparisons with the Best
### Author(s):
- Barry L. Nelson
- Jason C. Hsu
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
Using common random numbers (CRN) in simulation experiment design is known to reduce the variance of estimators of differences in system performance. However, when more than two systems are compared, exact simultaneous statistical inference in conjunction with CRN is typically impossible. We introduce control-variate models of CRN that permit exact statistical inference, specifically multiple comparisons with the best. These models explain the effect of CRN via a linear regression of the simulation output on control variates that are functions of the simulation inputs. We establish theoretically, and illustrate empirically, that the control-variate models lead to sharper statistical inference in the sense that the probability of detecting differences in systems' performance is increased.

## 8. Weighted Batch Means for Confidence Intervals in Steady-State Simulations
### Author(s):
- Diane P. Bischak
- W. David Kelton
- Stephen M. Pollock
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
We propose a new procedure for providing confidence-interval estimators of the mean of a covariance-stationary process. The procedure, a modification of the method of batch means, is an improvement over existing methods when the process displays strong correlation and a comparatively small number of observations is available.

## 9. Large Fluctuations in a Deterministic Multiclass Network of Queues
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper we investigate a relatively simple deterministic four-class two-queue multiclass open network of single-server FIFO queues with traffic intensity one at each queue. Our purpose is to better understand the effect of feedback with class-dependent service times at the queues. The example is sufficiently tractable that we are able to describe its transient behavior in great detail. The transient behavior depends strongly on the initial conditions and, for some initial conditions, the sample paths of the queue-length processes at individual stations have sudden large fluctuations (a large jump up followed immediately by a large jump down). These large fluctuations occur because batches of customers with short service times build up in the queues. Consistent with recent work by Dai and Wang (1993) on Brownian network models, these fluctuations rule out conventional heavy-traffic limit theorems. We show how to obtain proper heavy-traffic limits for this example by weakening the topology or enlarging the space of prospective limits (and changing the topology). This example also dramatically demonstrates a disadvantage of the FIFO discipline compared to other disciplines like head-of-the-line processor-sharing (HOL-PS) among the classes at each queue (under which, the large fluctuations do not occur). Finally, the critical arrival rate for stability in our example actually depends on the service discipline, being even lower if the classes with longer service times are given high priority at each queue. This phenomenon can occur in the network setting because individual queues can be empty when there is work in the network.

## 10. Laplace-Weibull Mixtures for Modeling Price Changes
### Author(s):
- S. T. Rachev
- A. SenGupta
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1993
### Abstract:
B. Mandelbrot and E. Fama in the sixties, and W. Ziemba in the seventies, suggested stable laws for modeling stock returns and commodity prices. Geometric stable distributions, with Laplace distribution playing the role of a normal law, have been found to give better fit to such data. We study the stability properties of Laplace and a mixture of Laplace and Weibull and discuss the statistical inference for such mixture models. Application of the mixture distribution to modeling price changes in real estate prices in France is given.
