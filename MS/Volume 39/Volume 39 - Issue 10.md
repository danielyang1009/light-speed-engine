## 1. Context-Dependent Preferences
### Author(s):
- Amos Tversky

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
The standard theory of choicebased on value maximizationassociates with each option a real value such that, given an offered set, the decision maker chooses the option with the highest value. Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the market share of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent preferences.

## 5. The Output Process of Serial Production Lines of General Machines with Finite Buffers
### Author(s):
- Kevin B. Hendricks
- John O. McClain
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
Little is known about the interaction among manufacturing subsystems in a factory. The output of one manufacturing subsystem is usually the input to one or more others in the plant. For example, a production line may provide input to another manufacturing stage, a shipping system, or an automated parts conveyor. In all of these examples, the characteristics of the output from the production line can affect the subsequent process. This paper examines the output process of a serial production line of N machines with general processing time distributions and finite buffer capacities.

## 6. The Valuation of Path Dependent Contracts on the Average
### Author(s):
- Peter Ritchken
- L. Sankarasubramanian
- Anand M. Vijh
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
This article values option contracts based on the average price realized over a finite time horizon. Such contracts are of importance to traders who periodically transact in spot markets and who require protection from adverse moves in their total accrued costs realized over their trading horizons. Explicit valuation models for pricing a variety of path dependent contracts based on geometric and arithmetic averages are developed. The early exercise features of American contracts are investigated, and it is shown that this feature has significant value.

## 7. Decision Structuring with Phantom Alternatives
### Author(s):
- Peter H. Farquhar
- Anthony R. Pratkanis
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
A phantom alternative is an illusory choice optionit looks real but for some reason is unavailable at the time a decision is made. Phantoms can both help and hinder successful decision making. On the one hand, phantoms can provide useful information on the boundaries of a decision problem and thus help generate new options through a restructuring of the problem. But phantoms can also produce biases, deception, and suboptimal decisions.

## 8. Inferences with an Unknown Noise Level in a Bernoulli Process
### Author(s):
- Anil Gaba
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
Inferences about a proportion p are often based on data generated from dichotomous processes, which are generally modeled as processes that are Bernoulli in p. In reality, the assumption that a data-generating process is Bernoulli in p is often violated due to the presence of noise. The level of noise is usually unknown and, furthermore, dependent on the unknown proportion in which one is interested. A specific model which takes into account the existence of noise is developed. Any arguments about p based exclusively on a likelihood analysis can lead to difficulties. A Bayesian approach is used, which also helps us to formalize a priori dependence between the proportion and the noise level. Empirical data are used to illustrate the model and provide some flavor of the implications of our uncertainty about the noise for inferences about a proportion.

## 9. Evaluating the Overflow Probability Using the Infinite Queue
### Author(s):
- Hirotaka Sakasegawa
- Masakiyo Miyazawa
- Genji Yamazaki
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
This paper presents an approximation formula for the overflow probability for GI/GI/c(N) queues in terms of a queue-length distribution for the corresponding GI/GI/c() queues, where N is the total capacity of the system. The approximation is based on the conservation law, and on assumptions which might be acceptable if N  c. The authors' approximation formula is numerically examined for various phase-type GI/GI/c(N) queues and the results show that the approximation is very good for practical parameter settings. The authors' approximation stands merely on a stationarity assumption. Therefore, it is also expected to be good for G/G/c(N) queues with a large N.

## 10. Discounted and Per Unit Net Revenues and Costs of Product Warranty: The Case of Phase-Type Lifetimes
### Author(s):
- Edward P. C. Kao
- Marion Spokony Smith
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
In a paper published in this journal, Mamer (1987) studies the expected costs to producers and benefits to consumers of three types of product warranty: the ordinary free replacement warranty, the unlimited free replacement warranty, and the pro-rata warranty. In addition to assuming a random product lifetime, Mamer's models allow for randomness in consumer repurchase behavior and for the possibility of an independent damage process acting on products sold under warranty. The criteria for evaluating warranty policies are discounted costs and net revenues over an infinite horizon, and per unit costs and net revenues. In this paper, we consider the case of phase-type product lifetimes. Under this assumption, we simplify the computation of the expected cost and revenue functions. Since most distributions can often be represented by phase-type distributions, our simplifications enhance the applicability of Mamer's useful yet computationally unwieldy results. For the per-unit-net-revenue criterion, our results supplement those of Mamer's. There, we also establish an interesting relation pertaining to expected net revenues as a function of consumer loyalty. We find that under the per-unit-net-revenue criterion, from the producer's perspective, repeated purchases by the same customer are not as profitable as one would intuitively conjecture. Such a counter-intuitive relation makes the need for being able to compute various cost and revenue functions more compellingparticularly when lifetimes are not exponential.

## 11. A Combined Tchebycheff/Aspiration Criterion Vector Interactive Multiobjective Programming Procedure
### Author(s):
- Ralph E. Steuer
- Joe Silverman
- Alan W. Whisman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper we combine the Tchebycheff method of Steuer and Choo with Wierzbicki's Aspiration Criterion Vector method in order to form an improved procedure for interactive multiple objective programming. The Combined procedure is sensible because the Tchebycheff and Aspiration Criterion Vector methods possess complementary distinguishing characteristics, solve similar optimization problems to probe the nondominated set, and share a similar computer/user interface. In the early iterations, Tchebycheff probes of the nondominated set might be conducted to locate promising neighborhoods of search. In later iterations, Aspiration Criterion Vector probes might be used to pinpoint a final solution. Computational experience is reported showing the improved effectiveness of the Combined Procedure when employed in this fashion when compared against the Tchebycheff and Aspiration Criterion Vector methods run separately.

## 12. A Procedure for Ranking Efficient Units in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Per Andersen
- Niels Christian Petersen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) evaluates the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) but does not allow for a ranking of the efficient units themselves. A modified version of DEA based upon comparison of efficient DMUs relative to a reference technology spanned by all other units is developed. The procedure provides a framework for ranking efficient units and facilitates comparison with rankings based on parametric methods.

## 13. Maximum Likelihood, Consistency and Data Envelopment Analysis: A Statistical Foundation
### Author(s):
- Rajiv D. Banker
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
This paper provides a formal statistical basis for the efficiency evaluation techniques of data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA estimators of the best practice monotone increasing and concave production function are shown to be also maximum likelihood estimators if the deviation of actual output from the efficient output is regarded as a stochastic variable with a monotone decreasing probability density function.

### Abstract:
This paper compares installation and echelon stock policies for multilevel inventory control. The major results are for serial and assembly systems. For (Q, r)-rules, echelon stock policies are, in general, superior to installation stock policies. A Kanban-policy is identified as a restricted type of installation stock (Q, r)-policy.

## 15. Antecedents and Consequences of Project Team Cross-Functional Cooperation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1993
### Abstract:
Cross-functional teams can greatly facilitate the successful implementation of projects. This study examined the influence of a set four antecedent constructs (superordinate goals, accessibility, physical proximity and formalized rules and procedures) on the attainment of both cross-functional cooperation and perceived project outcomes. Through the use of path analysis, the results indicated that superordinate goals, physical proximity and project team rules and procedures have significant direct and/or indirect effects on project outcomes through influencing cross-functional cooperation. Further, cross-functional cooperation was a significant predictor of both perceived task and psychosocial project outcomes. Directions for management practice and future research are discussed.
