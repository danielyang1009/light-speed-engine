## 1. Manufacturing Flexibility: A Strategic Perspective
### Author(s):
- Donald Gerwin
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
To help meet competitive realities operations managers need to know more about the strategic aspects of manufacturing flexibility. This paper takes steps toward meeting that need by critically reviewing the literature and establishing a research agenda for the area. A conceptual model, which places flexibility within a broad context, helps to identify certain assumptions of theoretical studies which need to be challenged. The model also provides a basis for identifying specific flexibility dimensions. The manner in which these dimensions may limit the effectiveness of a manufacturing process, and the problems in operationalizing them are discussed. Focusing next on the neglected area of applied work, concepts are presented for analyzing whether desired amounts of flexibility are being achieved and whether the potential for flexibility built into a manufacturing process is being tapped. Once more, a procedure is outlined for altering a plant's types and amounts of flexibility over time. The research agenda, which grows out of the appraisal of theoretical and applied work, indicates the value in studying generic flexibility strategies, the flexibility dimensions, methods of delivery, ways of evaluating and changing a process's flexibility, and above all measurement problems. The conclusions indicate principles for strategic research, some of which have relevance for the development of mathematical models.

## 2. Alternative Conceptions of Feedback in Dynamic Decision Environments: An Experimental Investigation
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Studies conducted in recent years have shown that outcome feedback in dynamic decision-making tasks does not lead to improved performance. This has led researchers to examine alternatives to outcome feedback for improving decision makers' performance in such tasks. This study examines the feasibility of improving performance in dynamic tasks by providing cognitive feedback or feedforward. We report a laboratory experiment in which subjects managed a set of simulated software development projects. Results indicate that subjects provided with cognitive feedback performed best, followed by those provided with feedforward. Subjects provided with outcome feedback performed poorly. We discuss the implications of the results for decision support in dynamic tasks.

## 3. Including the Value of Time in Design-for-Manufacturing Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Design for manufacturing (DFM) has been promoted as a way to enhance product development and production system performance. Current DFM practices encourage the minimization of the number of parts in a design through the physical integration of several geometric features in the same part. While this part integration often reduces the manufacturing cost of the product, it also can extend product development lead time, because complex parts typically require tooling with large lead times. This paper presents an economic model that makes explicit the trade-off between lower unit costs and longer product development time. This model is applied to a particular example in a field study of the application of DFM to Polaroid cameras.

## 4. Parallelism in Information Production: Moral Hazard and Relative Performance Evaluations
### Author(s):
- Peter Bogetoft
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
We analyse how to design incentive schemes for agents producing information. The agents may, for example, be divisional managers, market researchers, OR consultants, financial analysts, corporate auditors, research scientists or political pollsters. We show that an agent should be compensated more for making a correct rather than an incorrect prediction, and for agreeing rather than disagreeing with colleagues. Depending on the environment, correctness should be compensated more or less than agreement. Also, compensation should increase with the difficulties of making correct or conforming predictions. One consequence of the result is that it may sometimes reduce a principal's total incentive costs to engage with more information producers performing parallel investigations, because the possibility to make relative performance evaluations of the agents may substantially reduce the costs of motivating the agents in performing their duties as desired.

## 5. Zero-Tolerance Policies: Do They Inhibit or Stimulate Illicit Drug Consumption?
### Author(s):
- Jonathan P. Caulkins
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
Some have suggested fighting the drug problem with so-called zero-tolerance policies that impose stiff sanctions for possession of even trace amounts of illicit drugs. Such policies can swamp the criminal justice system and violate the principle that the punishment should fit the crime, but these objections have often been suppressed by an overriding desire to minimize consumption.

## 6. A Dual Ascent and Column Generation Heuristic for the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem with Setup Times
### Author(s):

- Marc Salomon
- Roelof Kuik
- Luk N. Van Wassenhove
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper the Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling Problem (DLSP) with setup times is considered. DLSP is the problem of determining the sequence and size of production batches for multiple items on a single machine. The objective is to find a minimal cost production schedule such that dynamic demand is fulfilled without backlogging.

## 7. The Bootstrap Approach for Testing Skewness Persistence
### Author(s):
- Krishnamurty Muralidhar
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
This study presents a new methodology for testing changes in skewness between time periods (or samples) using the bootstrap method. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the bootstrap method with the method suggested by Lau, Wingender and Lau (1989) to test skewness persistence. The results show the bootstrap method to be more powerful than the other method. The bootstrap method was also used to determine the persistence of skewness in stock returns. The results show that, in a large percentage of stocks, skewness persists over time.

## 8. Bandwidth Packing: A Tabu Search Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
The bandwidth packing (BWP) problem is a combinatorially difficult problem arising in the area of telecommunications. The problem consists of assigning calls to paths in a capacitated graph, such that capacities are not violated and the total profit is maximized. In this paper we discuss the development of a tabu search (TS) method for the BWP problem. The method makes use of an efficient implementation of the k-shortest path algorithm, that allows the identification of a controlled set of feasible paths for each call. A tabu search is then performed to find the best path assignment for each call. The TS method developed here incorporates a number of features that have proved useful for obtaining optimal and near optimal solutions to difficult combinatorial problems. We establish the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance in speed and solution quality to other specialized heuristics and to a standard optimization package applied to a 0-1 integer programming formulation of the problem.

## 9. Aggregating Point Estimates: A Flexible Modeling Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1993
### Abstract:
In many decision situations information is available from a number of different sources. Aggregating the diverse bits of information is an important aspect of the decision-making process but entails special statistical modeling problems in characterizing the information. Prior research in this area has relied primarily on the use of historical data as a basis for modeling the information sources. We develop a Bayesian framework that a decision maker can use to encode subjective knowledge about the information sources in order to aggregate point estimates of an unknown quantity of interest. This framework features a highly flexible environment for modeling the probabilistic nature and interrelationships of the information sources and requires straightforward and intuitive subjective judgments using proven decision-analysis assessment techniques. Analysis of the constructed model produces a posterior distribution for the quantity of interest. An example based on health risks due to ozone exposure demonstrates the technique.
