## 2. Models for Measuring and Accounting for Cost of Conformance Quality

### Published:

### Abstract:
We build a model to measure and account for the cost of quality. We incorporate the impact of quality on lead time variance and on service reliability and demand. Quality costs are a joint and nonlinear function of various parameters of the manufacturing process. Our model shows that it may not be optimal for quality improvement efforts to target products that have the highest defective levels, largest direct costs or consume the maximum capital resources. A stochastic dynamic programming model is developed to evaluate the optimal trade-offs across prevention and appraisal costs, and the costs of failure.

## 3. Timid Choices and Bold Forecasts: A Cognitive Perspective on Risk Taking
### Author(s):
- Daniel Kahneman
- Dan Lovallo
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
Decision makers have a strong tendency to consider problems as unique. They isolate the current choice from future opportunities and neglect the statistics of the past in evaluating current plans. Overly cautious attitudes to risk result from a failure to appreciate the effects of statistical aggregation in mitigating relative risk. Overly optimistic forecasts result from the adoption of an inside view of the problem, which anchors predictions on plans and scenarios. The conflicting biases are documented in psychological research. Possible implications for decision making in organizations are examined.

## 4. The Impact of Perceived Environmental Uncertainty and Perceived Agent Effectiveness on the Composition of Compensation Contracts

### Abstract:
Recently, a stream of theoretical development concerning the design of optimal compensation plans has emerged in the marketing literature. Little empirical work has been done so far to validate the theoretical predictions. The findings from the few field studies are equivocal and conflicting which we ascribe to failure to account for the major assumptions underlying the theoretical predictions. We argue that, in order to enhance the rigor of theory testing, the field studies must be complemented by laboratory experiments where the conditions stipulated by the assumptions of the theory can be systematically imposed and/or relaxed. This should help in the reconciliation of the differences found in the field studies. The experiment reported in this paper is a first step towards filling this void in the empirical research in this area. Here, we assess the impact of perceived environmental uncertainty and perceived agent effectiveness on the magnitude (total pay) and composition (salary-incentive mix) of employment compensation. The hypotheses stem from propositions analytically derived by Basu, Lal, Srinivasan, and Staelin (1985) and Lal and Srinivasan (1988). The insurance industry middle management compensation problem served as the experimental context.

## 5. Experimentation and Optimal Output Decisions: The Cooperative Versus the Entrepreneurial Firm
### Author(s):
- Patrick Thompson
- Ira Horowitz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
This paper studies and contrasts the experimental inclinations of entrepreneurial and cooperative firms supplying a perishable good under uncertain demand, when larger stocks might yield additional information about the demand-generating process. While these firms might react differently, and in the case of the cooperative not unambiguously, to environmental change, neither variant will find the higher outputpossibly more informativeoption especially attractive.

## 6. The Solution of Multiperiod Network Models with Bundle Constraints by Aggregation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
We present a new network aggregation/disaggregation approach for solving a multiperiod, network model with bundle (Generalized Upper Bounding) side constraints. The model describes production planning and distribution problems. Instead of solving the original multicommodity problem, we transform it so that a pair of single-commodity network flow problems can be solved. The original network is aggregated and the resulting problem is solved. Its solution determines a disaggregated problem that yields a feasible, near optimal solution to the original problem.

## 7. Screening Women of Childbearing Age for Human Immunodeficiency Virus: A Model-Based Policy Analysis
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the costs and benefits of screening women of childbearing age for HIV. The analysis is based on a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic that incorporates disease transmission and progression over time, behavioral changes, and effects of screening and associated counseling and education. The model allows one to consider not only effects on the screened women and their newborns, but also effects on the rest of the population. The analysis reveals that the primary benefit of screening programs targeted to women of childbearing age lies not in the prevention of HIV infection in their newborns but in the prevention of infection in their adult contacts. We find that screening medium and high risk women is likely to be cost-beneficial. Screening women regardless of risk group may also be cost-beneficial if screened positive women show relatively modest levels of behavioral change, but screening programs that reach primarily low risk women are not likely to be cost-beneficial. The results hold over a broad range of sensitivity analyses of important variables.

## 8. Solving Infinite-Horizon Discounted Markov Games Using a Superharmonic Least-Element Algorithm
### Author(s):
- D. J. White
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper we present an algorithm for solving infinite-horizon discounted Markov games based upon the fact that the value function is a least element of a superharmonic set. The algorithm produces a pair of policies whose value function is within a specified error of the solution to the fixed point equation. Part of the algorithm involves solving a set of fractional programs which are replaced by equivalent linear programs.

## 9. Optimal Allocation of Work in Assembly Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
We investigate how to allocate work in stochastic assembly systems so as to maximize throughput. We use Markov models for systems with exponential processing times and simulation-based methods for other probability distributions. We find that assembly systems should be unbalanced in the direction of assigning less work to assembly and more to component stations. We also find that greater parallelism offers greater opportunity for improvement.

## 10. Competition and Investment in Flexible Technologies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
This paper examines the implications of market structure on investment in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). We analyze a two-stage game, in which firms choose between a flexible and a less flexible technology in the first stage, then choose production quantities in the second stage. In equilibrium, a large proportion of FMS firms is associated with more concentrated markets. Our model predicts that a larger market and/or a more differentiated product results in a higher proportion of FMS firms being sustained. These predictions are empirically supported using cross-section industry level data from both the US and Japan.

## 12. Notes: Toward Characterizing the Optimal Allocation of Storage Space in Production Line Systems with Variable Processing Times
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1993
### Abstract:
This investigation considers certain issues regarding the optimal design of unpaced production lines with variable processing times. Under certain assumptions, including an equal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations, it is known that the optimal allocation of work is characterized by the bowl phenomenon whereby the interior stations (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (less work) over the end stations. The key question now being posed is: given an equal allocation of work to the respective stations, does the optimal allocation of buffer storage space between the respective pairs of stations follow an analogous pattern (the storage bowl phenomenon) whereby the interior buffers (especially the center ones) are given preferential treatment (more space) over the end buffers? Because the decision variables now are discrete instead of continuous, the answer found in this study is: sometimes, but not in general. Characterizing the optimal allocation of storage space is a surprisingly subtle and complex problem. Despite the ambiguities, one dominant theme that runs throughout all of the results obtained is that, to the extent that preferential treatment in storage space allocations should be given, priority should be given to the interior buffers (especially the center ones) over the end buffers. The other key conclusion is that, when the total amount of storage space also is a decision variable, the overall optimal solution commonly follows a storage bowl phenomenon whereby the allocation of buffer storage space fits an inverted bowl pattern.
