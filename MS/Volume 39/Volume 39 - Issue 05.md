## 1. The Rational Effect of Price Promotions on Sales and Consumption

### Published:

### Abstract:
We explore the rational effect of price variation on sales and consumption in markets where consumers are uncertain about the future price of goods. We first derive an optimal ordering policy which expresses the amount a consumer should purchase and consume in a given period as a function of the observed price of the good, the distribution of future prices, and the nature of his or her inventory. This policy extends previous normative models of inventory control, such as those by Golabi (1985) and Kalymon (1970) to the case where the amount to consume in a given period is an explicit decision variable and prices follow a first-order stochastic process. We then use this model to explore how changes in the long-run frequency and temporal correlations of price promotions should normatively affect the contemporaneous relationship between purchase, consumption and price. Among the predictions which follow from the model are that consumption should rationally increase with the size of existing inventories, the short-term sensitivity of sales to prices should be greater than that of consumption to price, and this discrepancy increases with decreases in the temporal correlation of price deals and the long-term relative frequency of price deals.

## 2. An Inventory Model of Immediate and Delayed Delivery
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This paper considers the long run, profit maximizing strategy of a distributor that holds a good (good 1) in inventory for immediate delivery and that offers a second good (good 2) for delayed delivery. When the two goods are substitutes, an out-of-stock situation for good 1 will cause some consumers (walkers) to seek the good elsewhere, other consumers (waiters) to accept a raincheck for later delivery of good 1, and others still (switchers) to place an order for good 2. It is shown that a profit maximizing strategy may entail setting a price for the delayed delivery item so as to encourage switching behavior. The rationale is that the distributor can hold a smaller inventory, thereby incurring lower holding costs, because out-of-stock situations are less costly than they would be without some consumers being willing to switch.

## 3. A Synthesis of Decision Models for Tool Management in Automated Manufacturing
### Author(s):
- Ann E. Gray
- Abraham Seidmann

### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
The evidence is clear that a lack of attention to structured tool management has resulted in the poor performance of many manufacturing systems. Plant tooling systems affect product design options, machine loading, job batching, capacity scheduling, and real-time part routing decisions. With increasing automation in manufacturing systems, there is a growing need to integrate tool management more thoroughly into system design, planning and control.

## 4. Portfolio Selection and Asset PricingThree-Parameter Framework
### Author(s):
- Yusif Simaan
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
Idiosyncratic security risks are modelled as following a joint spherical distribution characterized by a mean vector and a generalized covariance matrix. Skewness is generated by a single factor for the whole economy, but upon which different securities have different loadings. This results in three-fund separationtwo funds to span the spherical risk and one more fund to span the additional skewness risk. A three-parameter normative portfolio analysis that allows short sales restrictions is developed. In addition, a three-parameter capital asset pricing model is provided.

## 5. What is the Opportunity Cost of Mean-Variance Investment Strategies?
### Author(s):
- Yusif Simaan
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
An analytical framework is set up to evaluate the foregone opportunity cost of mean-variance investment strategies. A parametric structure of the joint distribution of security returns, for which mean-variance investment strategy is suboptimal, is specified. For all constant absolute risk-aversion investors, the optimal strategy, its corresponding mean-variance alternative, and the foregone opportunity cost of mean-variance investment strategy are analytically derived and operationalized empirically. When the investor's opportunity set includes the riskless asset, the premium to replace the mean-variance investment strategy by its optimal one does not exceed 0.05 cents on an invested dollar regardless of the investor's risk aversion. When the riskless asset is denied, the opportunity costs of mean-variance investment strategies increase with the degree of risk aversion.

## 6. How to Settle an Estate
### Author(s):
- H. Martin Weingartner
- Bezalel Gavish
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This paper considers the equitable division of a set of assets, all or some of which are indivisible, among two beneficiaries, simultaneously using several methods of valuing the assets. The problem arises when a fiduciary is required to distribute the assetsof a trust or estate, or to divide the property in a divorce or in dissolution of a partnershipin which the assets have separate market values and tax bases. In other variations of this problem, the beneficiaries are presumed also to possess an infinitely divisible asset, such as cash, or some of the assets may be liquidated. Models for combining consideration of subjective values for the assets in addition to the objective market values are considered. Computational methods for these problems are discussed and illustrated.

## 7. Effects of Ambiguity in Market Experiments
### Author(s):
- Rakesh K. Sarin
- Martin Weber
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
Prior studies have shown that individuals are averse to ambiguity in probability. Many decisions are, however, made in market settings where an individual's decision is influenced by decisions of others participating in the market. In this paper, we extend the previous research to evaluate the effect of ambiguity on individual decisions and the resulting market price in market settings. We therefore examine an important issue: whether ambiguity effects persist in the face of market incentives and feedback.

## 8. Minimizing the Makespan in the 3-Machine Assembly-Type Flowshop Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This paper considers minimizing the makespan in the 3-machine assembly-type flowshop scheduling problem. After problem formulation, we present a proof to show that the general version of this problem is strongly NP-complete. We then discuss a few polynomially solvable cases of the problem and present the solution algorithms. Next, a branch and bound solution scheme is suggested. Finally, three heuristics to find approximate solutions to the general problem are proposed and their error bounds are analyzed.

## 9. Weighted Tardiness Single Machine Scheduling with Proportional Weights
### Author(s):
- Wlodzimierz Szwarc
- John J. Liu
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This paper considers Arkin and Roundy's single machine weighted tardiness scheduling model with tardiness penalties proportional to the processing times. It presents a two-stage decomposition mechanism that proves to be powerful in solving the problem completely or reducing it to a much smaller problem. Three types of orderings of adjacent jobs are derived that play a crucial role in problem decomposition. The decomposition method solves 155 out of 320 test problems with job sizes ranging from 20 to 150. It reduces 163 unsolved problems to smaller subproblems with sizes not exceeding 25 jobs. The job sizes of the remaining two unsolved subproblems are 30 and 45.

## 10. Two-Stage Perishable Inventory Models
### Author(s):

- Betsy S. Greenberg
- Hirofumi Matsuo
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider perishable inventory systems with two types of demand. Demand may be for either fresh items or for somewhat older items. We model the system with two inventory stages. The first stage holds fresh items and the second stage holds the older items. We approximate the performance of the two-stage inventory system and compare two managerial policies.

## 11. A Single Bottleneck System with Binomial Yields and Rigid Demand
### Author(s):
- Abraham Grosfeld-Nir
- Boaz Ronen
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This paper considers a single bottleneck system: a multistage production system where all setups except one are zero. The stage with nonzero setup is defined to be the bottleneck; it may be thought of as the critical resource whose throughput largely determines the throughput of the entire system, as a envisioned by the OPT philosophy. Production is in lots with uncertain (binomial) yields and demand needs to be satisfied in full, thus possibly necessitating multiple production runs. We show how the optimal control problem can be reduced to that of optimal lotsizing a single stage.

## 12. Notes: The Dynamics of Plant Layout
### Author(s):
- Jaydeep Balakrishnan
### Published:
- 1 May 1993
### Abstract:
This note develops a fathoming procedure for the Dynamic Plant Layout Problem (DPLP) discussed by Rosenblatt (1986) in this journal. This procedure can be used to reduce the number of candidate static layouts to be examined. An important feature of our procedure is that a feasible dynamic solution is not required in order to apply it. The effectiveness of this procedure depends on the relative magnitude of the shifting costs.
