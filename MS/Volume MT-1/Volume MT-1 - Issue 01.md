## 2. Monte Carlo Solution of Waiting Line Problems
### Author(s):
- Billy E. Goetz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
This presentation makes no pretense of original contribution to either Monte Carlo or waiting-line analysis. It is merely an attempt to explain an important application of an interesting technique to managers somewhat lacking in mathematical sophistication. My objective is to enable such managers: (1) to recognize situations in which the technique may be useful, (2) to select appropriate staff or consulting personnel to make such studies, (3) to collaborate with such associates in establishing objectives and in formulating the general approach to be used, (4) to understand the results of such studies and to accept and implement these results intelligently, and (5) to be able to solve such problems as may be simple enough and intriguing enough to give sufficient pleasure to warrant the undertaking.

## 3. Operating Management Speaks
### Author(s):
- Roger R. Crane
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
On December 4, 1958, the Detroit Chapter of The Institute of Management Sciences organized a panel discussion entitled “Operating Management Speaks” to present what operating management would like from the mathematical analysis of business operations.

## 4. System Engineering
### Author(s):
- Merrill M. Flood
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
I shall concentrate my remarks upon a few of the techniques that the System Engineer has been using increasingly during the past decade—powerful techniques from science, mathematics, and economics that the System Engineer is finding have frequent and general applicability in his field. I shall also present my own views regarding good general strategies to use in approaching various types of system engineering tasks, views that seem to me often to conflict both with the majority view and with common practice among system engineers. My own system engineering experience is almost entirely with military systems, and there always with only a portion of some major system; it is rare, if ever, that one man has had the opportunity to system engineer a major military system from conception to operation, so almost all experience is fragmentary in this sense.

## 5. On Some Aspects of Technological Measurement
### Author(s):
- S. B. Littauer
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
In this discussion no attempt is made to establish a theory of technological measurement, not to say the theory of technological measurement. We will consider some aspects of technological measurement but still leave room for inquiry in the formulation of a theory of measurement.

## 6. A Linear Programming Approach to Production and Employment Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Fred Hanssmann
- Sidney W. Hess
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The problem of production and employment scheduling may be stated as follows. Given the monthly demands for the product turned out by a factory, what should be the monthly production rates and work force levels in order to minimize the total cost of regular payroll and overtime, hiring and layoffs, inventory and shortages incurred during a given planning interval of several months? This problem has received a classical solution in two papers by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, H. A. Simon. 1955. A linear decision rule for production and employment scheduling. Management Sci. (October); Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, J. F. Muth. 1956. Derivation of a linear decision rule for production and employment. Management Sci. (January).). These authors assumed quadratic cost functions. Their treatment of the problem will be referred to as “quadratic programming.” It appears, however, that in the majority of practical applications and theoretical models the cost functions are assumed to be linear. It, therefore, seems desirable to have a method of solution for the linear case as well. In this paper it is shown that a solution can be obtained by linear programming methods. From the linear programming viewpoint, this paper is of an expository nature.

## 7. Study of a Textile Mill with the Aid of Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Kurt Eisemann
- William M. Young
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
The present study encompassed an overall examination of the operations of a textile mill, operated by the Pepperell Mfg. Co. and engaged in the production of blankets. It was hoped at the outset that application of the mathematical methods of operations research might yield findings and insights pointing to a potentially more profitable management of existing facilities. These hopes were subsequently amply fulfilled.

## 8. Optimization of Investment—A Solution by Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Mario Bertoletti
- Jorge Chapiro
- Horacio Rieznik
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
We develop an application of linear programming to the problem of the distribution of a certain investment which is restricted to a fixed amount among the various productive processes or departments of an enterprise, so as to obtain a maximum profit improvement.

## 9. Planning Continuous Production by Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Mario Bertoletti
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is developed to solve the problem of capacity allocation by means of linear programming for such conditions where no intermediate stock is feasible (that is a condition which cannot be accepted in the classic linear programming model).

## 10. The Demonstration of Statistical Control Problems by an Electronic Analog
### Author(s):
- John P. Hyland
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
Modern industrial processes are usually complex and present operators with many problems of control. These arise especially in human monitoring of control systems leading to changes being made by interpretation of instrument readings. Two major management problems arise here (a) to get process operators to recognize that these discrepancies will arise and are of a stochastic nature; and (b) to teach them how to interpret the data they observe quantitatively and how to reach correct decisions thereby.

## 11. Design of a Management Information System
### Author(s):
- David S. Stoller
- Richard L. Van Horn
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1960
### Abstract:
Several of the important problem areas encountered in designing a management information system for operations and maintenance control of a major weapon system are discussed herein. Three types of design approaches are considered: (1) method and equipment improvement, (2) data augmentation, and (3) decision orientation. The latter approach is illustrated by a weapon system example. Design objectives which are useful in establishing detailed design criteria are discussed. The concepts of this paper are relevant to many non-military systems.
