## 2. Observations on the Role of Business Research as an Aid to Managers
### Author(s):
- Melvin L. Hurni
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
In speaking of the Role of Business Research as an Aid to Managers, I am going to make an assumption. This assumption is simply that for the foreseeable future, most industrial businesses will be constituted pretty much as they are now. They will be loosely coupled systems in which many people will continue to play a major role in sensing, deciding, regulating, adjusting, innovating.

## 3. The Sociological Impact of Automation in the Office
### Author(s):
- Ida R. Hoos
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
In the context of such subjects as optimization of equations, techniques of mathematical programming, and the like, “The Sociological Impact of Automation in the Office” may appear somewhat out of place. This is because there has been a lag in the feedback process between the conventional social scientists and the operations research and management science people. Some work involving high-speed electronic computers, as that concerned with nuclear fission, has begun to achieve a closed loop, with the social implications of the scientific advances taken so seriously as to affect the actual pattern and direction of research in some cases. Inclusion at this conference of a paper on office automation in relation to its significance for the workers involved indicates that OR and TIMS people are becoming aware that their activities may have social consequences worthy of consideration.

## 4. Operations Research as Applied to Construction
### Author(s):
- D. W. Heiman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to examine into the feasibility and desirability of the application of the management sciences to the management of construction. The rapid development of the use of scientific methods, techniques and tools in the solution of complex industrial management problems raises the question as to whether or not the scientific disciplines can be employed to improve construction management, perhaps the most diverse, ruggedly individualistic of our major enterprises.

## 5. An Addendum to General Heiman's Remarks
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
When as eminent an engineer as General Heiman calls the attention of civil engineers and the construction industry to Operations Research, I—as a practitioner of Operations Research—can only react enthusiastically and second his motions. Such motions are long overdue. The construction industry has been the slowest of the major American industries to avail itself of any type of research, let alone Operations Research. The census of Research and Development conducted by the National Science Foundation substantiates this assertion. What advances have been obtained in the industry through research have been largely due to materials and equipment manufacturers and not by the firms that design and construct.

## 6. Toward a Communicable Understanding of Planning: Creeds and Objectives
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Newman
- Edward Tomeski
- Arthur Sternhell
- Kirby Warren
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
A creed of The Institute of Management Sciences is that managing can be made more teachable and learnable through theoretical and empirical research and building a body of communicable knowledge of the emerging science of managing. An objective of the Institute is this body of knowledge. The establishment of various TIMS colleges is a strategy for obtaining this objective. A tactic of the Planning College is the establishment of study teams to review common beliefs of assigned aspects of the subject matter of planning and report the results of these studies to the College. A goal of the present study team is to initiate a fruitful discussion of two specific elements of the planning process so a common and communicable understanding and formal documentation of them will result.

## 7. Characteristics of Management Science
### Author(s):
- Melvin L. Hurni
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
All scientific areas of knowledge share common characteristics which distinguish them from the non-scientific. In evolving into a science an area of knowledge will acquire those characteristics common to a science. This is true of Management Science. But it is equally true that subject matter differences among sciences yield characteristics that distinguish one science from the others. For a scientist dedicated to a single field of knowledge, it is these distinguishing elements that are of prime importance in guiding his work and interests. What follows is the author's attempt to identify some of the critical characteristics of Management Science (as he sees it) consequent upon a major area of its subject matter, Business Organizations, for the purpose of clarifying its role as an applied business science.

## 8. Le Prix de Revient Est-Il une Utopie?
### Author(s):
- Cabinet Guy Bouchet
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to suggest a reallocation of costs in a manufacturing industry in such a way as to make it possible: (1) to compare profitability within different competitors and (2) to evaluate the profitability of each product line and the profitability of all sections (or departments) of a given company.

## 9. Production Planning Through Inventory Control
### Author(s):
- Wilfred C. Hugli, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
The need for control of production is well established in the science of management. The most effective methods of control are not. I believe the most effective method is control of production through inventory, and an explanation of that method is the purpose of this paper.

## 10. An Airline Provisioning Problem
### Author(s):
- James A. Shaunty
- Van Court Hare, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
The authors describe a method of computing the number of spare parts of each kind to have at each field station in a maintenance system. One-at-a-time replenishment is used and the variables considered are: (1) the replenishment time from a central warehouse to field stations, (2) a specified protection level (maximum number of shortages per year), and (3) the predicted usage rate for each part-station combination. The method employs multi-channel queuing theory in a routine programmed for Univac I. Of basic interest is the technique of predicting part-station usage from the number of landings per time period, rather than from hours flown, a modification of usual airline practice that allows usage predictions to be tied directly to a given station, and, furthermore, allows allocations of parts to stations to be revised as schedules change. Thus, the procedure bases inventory levels at each station on future needs, rather than on past history—a poor predictor as plane types and schedules are revised. The method is also applicable to field inventory planning for non-airline use, particularly if part usage is low, if one-at-a-time replenishment is used, and if the number of part-station combinations serviced is large.

## 11. Decision Making in Competitive Situations
### Author(s):
- Lawrence Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
A method of making decisions in competitive situations is discussed which attempts to use analysis in a more rational manner than in the methods given by the mathematical theory of games. The method is based on two principles which have been the subject of much controversy in the field of decision theory. These principles are, (1) In any real competitive situation there is one and only one optimal course of action, and (2) In any real competitive situation there is one and only one objective function. This objective function is the maximization of expected utility.

## 12. Planning Advertising Expenditures by Dynamic Programming Methods
### Author(s):
- Richard B. Maffei
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1960
### Abstract:
Much of the importance of the new dynamic programming methods has remained unnoticed because of the apparent complexity of the underlying mathematics. This is indeed unfortunate because the essence of the programming methods for certain classes of problems is not new to practicing economists. Dynamic programming methods can provide an efficient computational algorithm for problem types frequently encountered in consumer demand and production theory.
