#### Date:
- December 10, 2010

- Craig J. Chapman
- Thomas J. Steenburgh
#### Date:

### 7. Competing to Be Certain (But Wrong): Market Dynamics and Excessive Confidence in Judgment
#### Author(s):
- Joseph R. Radzevick
- Don A. Moore
#### Date:
- November 19, 2010
#### Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate how market competition contributes to the expression of overconfidence among those competing for influence. We find evidence that market competition exacerbates the tendency to express excessive confidence. This evidence ...

### 8. Opportunity Spaces in Innovation: Empirical Analysis of Large Samples of Ideas
#### Author(s):
- Laura J. Kornish
- Karl T. Ulrich
#### Date:
- November 19, 2010
#### Abstract:
A common approach to innovation, parallel search, is to identify a large number of opportunities and then to select a subset for further development, with just a few coming to fruition. One potential weakness with parallel search is that it permits ...

### 9. Recruiting for Ideas: How Firms Exploit the Prior Inventions of New Hires
#### Author(s):
- Jasjit Singh
- Ajay Agrawal
#### Date:
- November 19, 2010
#### Abstract:
When firms recruit inventors, they acquire not only the use of their skills but also enhanced access to their stock of ideas. But do hiring firms actually increase their use of new recruits' prior inventions? Our estimates suggest they do, quite ...

### 10. Grammar-Based Integer Programming Models for Multiactivity Shift Scheduling
#### Author(s):
- Marie-Claude Côté
- Bernard Gendron
- Louis-Martin Rousseau
#### Date:
- December 3, 2010
#### Abstract:
This paper presents a new implicit formulation for shift scheduling problems, using context-free grammars to model the rules for the composition of shifts. From the grammar, we generate an integer programming (IP) model having a linear programming ...

- Anthony M. Kwasnica
#### Date:
- December 3, 2010
#### Abstract:
We investigate how auctioneers set reserve prices in auctions. A well-established theoretical result, assuming risk neutrality of the seller, is that the optimal reserve price should not depend on the number of participating bidders. In a set of ...

### 13. Understanding the Two Components of Risk Attitudes: An Experimental Analysis
#### Author(s):
- Jianying Qiu
- Eva-Maria Steiger
#### Date:
- December 3, 2010
#### Abstract:
Cumulative prospect theory introduced the weighting of probabilities as an additional component to capture risk attitudes. However, this addition would be a less significant challenge to expected utility theory (EU) if utility curvature and probability ...

### 14. Ranking Intervals and Dominance Relations for Ratio-Based Efficiency Analysis
#### Author(s):
- Ahti Salo
- Antti Punkka
#### Date:
- January 1, 2011
#### Abstract:
We develop comparative results for ratio-based efficiency analysis (REA) based on the decision-making units' (DMUs') relative efficiencies over sets of feasible weights that characterize preferences for input and output variables. Specifically, we ...
