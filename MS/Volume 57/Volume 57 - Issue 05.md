#### Author(s):
- Eric Van den Steen
#### Date:
- March 25, 2011
#### Abstract:
This paper derives two mechanisms through which Bayesian-rational individuals with differing priors will tend to be relatively overconfident about their estimates and predictions, in the sense of overestimating the precision of these estimates. The ...
