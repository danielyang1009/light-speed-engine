## 1. Utility Functions for Equity and Public Risk
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Keeney
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
With many large-scale projects, such as power plants, some members of the public will necessarily incur a risk. Public fatalities may result from either normal operations (e.g., via pollution) or accidents. Often in such cases, a small group of the public incur the risks, whereas a different group of the public receives the benefits from the project. In these circumstances, a major issue concerns the equity or fairness afforded members of the public. This paper develops the concept of an equitable distribution of risk to address this issue. Utility functions are found which are consistent with various basic value attitudes involving risk equity.

## 2. Scheduling of Network Television Programs
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey H. Horen
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
Maximizing average audience size is a major objective of national television networks. This paper examines the effect of scheduling programs on audience ratings. We determine the predictability of ratings and the major factors which influence ratings. We measure the extent to which ratings can be changed by rescheduling programs, and then test commonly discussed scheduling strategies and propose new strategies. Finally, we ascertain the extent to which the audience's benefit is served by a system of three major networks, each competing to maximize individual ratings.

## 3. The Influence of Decision Style on Decision Making Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
Cognitive styles measured by the Myers-Briggs indicator were studied to isolate how style influences decision behavior. An experiment was conducted in which experienced decision makers from hospitals and firms were asked to assess several capital expansion projects. To control for environmental factors, the project summaries were tailored to be compatible or incompatible with each individual's cognitive style. Risk and information sources were also controlled in the summary by using two levels of risk, defined by the spread of the return on investment (ROI) projections, and by using personal judgements or a computer-based model to provide the ROI estimates. The decision makers assessed each project, indicating their likelihood of adopting it and their perception of its risk. The impact of style, setting (hospital or firm), and the control factors (environment, information source, and risk) were related to a decision to adopt and assessments of risk by ANOVA techniques. Cognitive style was found to be an important factor in the decision to adopt and the assessment of risk. ST (sensation-thinking) styles saw the highest risk and were reluctant to adopt the projects, while SF (sensation-feeling) styles were risk tolerant and more likely to adopt the same projects. Our results support the views of cognitive theorists, who argue that decision style is an important determinant of behavior. Decisions seem to be a function of the decision maker's cognitive makeup which differs for different psychological types.

## 4. On Committee Decision Making: A Game Theoretical Approach
### Author(s):
- Prakash P. Shenoy
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the committee decision making process using game theory. By a committee, we mean any group of people who have to pick one option from a given set of alternatives. A well defined voting rule is specified by which the committee arrives at a decision. Each member has a preference relation on the set of all alternatives. A new solution concept called the one-core is introduced and studied. Intuitively, the one-core consists of all maximal (for the proposer) proposals which are undominated assuming that the player who makes the proposal does not cooperate in any effort to dominate the proposal. For games with non-emtpy cores, the one-core proposals are shown to be better than the core. For games with empty cores, the one-core proposals tend to be pessimistic, i.e., they indicate the security level of the players. This is because the stability requirements of the one-core are too strong for such games. A bargaining set modeled along the lines of the Aumann-Maschler bargaining set for characteristic function games is defined for committee games. Because of its relaxed stability requirements, the bargaining set indicates more reasonable proposals than the one-core. The existence of both the one-core and the bargaining set are studied and these concepts are compared with two other well known solution conceptsthe core and the Condorcet solution.

## 5. The Efficiency of the Price, Budget, and Mixed Approaches Under Varying a Priori Information Levels for Decentralized Planning
### Author(s):
- Richard M. Burton
- Brge Obel
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
Organizations have a choice of information and planning procedures to use for a coordinated plan. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of price and/or budget planning approaches, where the first proposal can be determined from a combination of historical plans, external prices, rules of thumb, and other data. The problem is to consider which planning approach and information structure are best.

## 6. CommunicationsRand-HUD Fire Models
### Author(s):
- Rodrick Wallace
- Deborah Wallace
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
The March, 1978 issue of Management Science carried a paper by Jan M. Chaiken titled Transfer of Emergency Service Deployment Models to Operating Agencies which purported to describe the successful implementation of, among other things, fire service management models developed by the Rand Corporation for the Office of Policy Development and Research of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The appearance of this paper at such a late date raises serious questions of professional responsibility and competence, both for the Rand-HUD team and for the management science and operations research communities.

## 7. Response to Communication on Rand-HUD Fire Models
### Author(s):

- Warren Walker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1980
### Abstract:
The Communication from Rodrick and Deborah Wallace repeats allegations that they have made in print [Wallace, D. 1977. New York city fire crisis, part one, the system is falling apart. Heights and Valley News (May) 1011; Wallace, R., D. Wallace. 1977. Studies on the Collapse of Fire Service in New York City 19721976: The Impact of Pseudoscience in Public Policy (pamphlet), Univ. Press of America, Washington, D.C.] and in various forums for more than three years. Their critique is not of Chaiken's paper, Transfer of Emergency Service Deployment Models to Operating Agencies, (Chaiken, J. 1978. Transfer of emergency service deployment models to operating agencies. Management Sci.24 (7) 719731.) but rather they use the appearance of that paper as an occasion to comment again on the application of Rand's fire deployment models in New York City during the period from 1972 to 1976. Readers of Chaiken's paper who are not familiar with this history are likely to wonder how his paper, which barely mentions New York City, inspired the Wallaces' comments in this Communication.
