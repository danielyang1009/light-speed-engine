## 1. Exceptional PaperA Theory of the U.S. Treasury Market Equilibrium
### Author(s):
- John Y. Barry
- Herbert F. Ayres
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
Above maturities of six months to a year, the equilibrium yield to maturity for government securities consists of two statistically independent components. The first, the so-called consol yield, is the same for every maturity. The change in the consol yield has the same impact on yield for every maturity and the mere knowledge of its sign dominates opportunities for trading profits. However the expected change in the consol yield and all other yields is zero.

## 2. Humans vs. Computer Algorithms for the Plant Layout Problem
### Author(s):
- Thomas W. Trybus
- Lewis D. Hopkins
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
An experiment with plant layout formulated as a quadratic assignment problem gave the following results: (1) The CRAFT algorithm does as well as human subjects in solving the plant layout problem; (2) CRAFT does better as problem size increases if the human subjects have no prior knowledge of the computer solution values; (3) there is no breakpoint in relative problem solving ability between humans and computers at 200% flow dominance (the coefficient of variation of the flow matrix expressed as a percent); (4) the point at which the computer becomes better, as opposed to equally good, is more clearly indicated by problem size than by flow dominance; (5) humans can solve problems with high flow dominance and problems with near-zero flow dominance better than they can solve problems with low flow dominance, though the computer is still at least as good across all levels of flow dominance.

## 3. An Information Processing Model of Organizational Perception, Strategy and Choice
### Author(s):
- Francis D. Tuggle
- Donald Gerwin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
The strategic decision making process is conceptualized to occur in seven phases. A computer simulation model based on these steps has been developed which integrates the processes of organizational perception of key environmental factors, strategy formulation by the organization, and execution of routine operating decisions and standard operating procedures. Fifty computer runs of the model show the necessity of qualifying more narrowly three simplistic, but intuitively obvious, hypotheses: (1) A firm will do better in a more munificent environment than a less munificent one. (2) A firm more sensitive to changes in its environment will do better than a less sensitive firm. (3) The more uncertainty there is in a firm's environment, the worse that firm will perform. The role of computer simulation models of organizational strategy-making in training top managers and strategic planners is sketched.

## 4. Solution of Spatial Equilibrium Problems with Benders Decomposition
### Author(s):
- Joseph Polito
- Bruce A. McCarl
- Thomas L. Morin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
Spatial equilibrium problems are frequently formulated as large scale quadratic programming problems or linear complementarity problems. We show that these problems can be reduced to two or more smaller problems with Generalized Benders Decomposition. The procedure then becomes iterative with the repetitive solution of the smaller problems. In practice, the iterative procedure has converged rapidly.

## 5. The Relationship between Attributes, Brand Preference, and Choice: A Stochastic View
### Author(s):
- Jean-Marie Blin
- Joe A. Dodson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
This paper draws from two separate research traditions in marketing theories of consumer behavior: multiattribute expectancy-value models and stochastic choice models. A behavioral basis for the observed brand-switching phenomenon is found in the multiattributed evaluation of alternatives and the uncertainty surrounding such evaluation. A model is proposed to deal with this phenomenon and is fitted against a comprehensive data set. The model is found to compare favorably in predictive value with other models.

## 6. Assessment of Simple Joint Time/Risk Preference Functions
### Author(s):
- Stephen M. Barrager
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
In choices between consumption and investment the consumer's objective is to maximize the expected utility of lifetime consumption. This paper outlines a procedure for constructing cardinal utility functions which capture both a consumer's willingness to trade off consumption between years and his attitude toward bearing risk. Simple but flexible utility functions are specified uniquely by mathematically combining the results of three straightforward assessment tasks. The information to be assessed from the consumer is:
A preferred consumption pattern for an appropriate lifetime consumption budget.
A coefficient of consumption variation aversion.
A coefficient of risk aversion with respect to constant annual equivalent consumption outcomes.

## 7. NoteA Node Elimination Procedure for Townsend's Algorithm for Solving the Single Machine Quadratic Penalty Function Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- P. C. Bagga
- K. R. Kalra
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1980
### Abstract:
In this note, a node elimination procedure has been suggested in case the two sequences obtained by using Townsend's (Townsend, W. 1978. The single machine problem with quadratic penalty function of completion times: A branch and bound solution. Management Sci.24 (5) 530534.) sufficient conditions for solving the single machine quadratic penalty function scheduling problem contain a subset Jr of r jobs in the first r positions. Numerical illustrations and computational experience has been given in the end.
