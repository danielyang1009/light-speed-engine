## 1. External Communication and Project Performance: An Investigation into the Role of Gatekeepers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
Research indicates that certain boundary spanning individuals, labelled gatekeepers, can be an important linking mechanism between organizations and their external environments. This study investigates the role of gatekeepers in the transfer of information in a single R&D setting by comparing directly the performance of project groups with and without gatekeepers. Results indicate that gatekeepers perform a linking role only for projects performing tasks that are locally oriented, while universally oriented tasks were most effectively linked to external areas by direct project member communication. Evidence also suggests that gatekeepers do more than mediate external information; they appear to facilitate the external communication of their more local project colleagues. Direct contact and contact mediated by gatekeepers, then, are two contrasting ways to link project groups with their external areas. The relative effectiveness of these linking mechanisms is contingent on the nature of the project's work.

## 2. Manpower Flows and the Innovation Process
### Author(s):
- John E. Ettlie
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
A model of the causes and impacts of manpower flows in the innovation process is developed in this paper. A review of some of the relevant literature and discussion of several case studies of manpower flows are presented. Some preliminary results are reported and emergent propositions and future research needs are discussed. One promising area of exploration appears to be the relationship between information flows, manpower flows, and importance of the innovation (radical vs. incremental) under consideration. Some implications for the management of technological change in organizations are discussed.

## 3. A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach to Air Cargo Fleet Planning
### Author(s):
- Roy E. Marsten
- Michael R. Muller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the mathematical programming aspects of a long range planning study done for the Flying Tiger Line, an all-cargo airline. The study addressed two strategic problems: the design of the service network and the selection and deployment of the aircraft fleet. We show how the concept of a spider graph provides a natural building block for network design and present a mixed-integer programming model that enables the planner to evaluate any network constructed from spider graphs by determining the most profitable selection of aircraft and routing of cargo.

## 5. The Bargain Value Model and a Comparison of Managerial Implications with the Linear Learning Model
### Author(s):
- John W. Keon
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
A new stochastic brand choice model, the Bargain Value Model, is introduced. Using consumer panel data, the model predicts an individual household's probability of purchasing various brands as a function of the prevailing price of those brands. Based on consumer behavior constructs, the model differs sharply from the Linear Learning Model in its behavioral interpretation. This difference leads the models to have divergent managerial policy implications. After describing the Bargain Value Model, the differences between the models are explored along with some empirical results.

## 6. Performance-Based Incentive Plans
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
Incentive plans are an integral part of management control since incentives as measures of recognition of performance are significant motivating factors for corporate executives. In this paper we describe how such incentive plans can be devised. We employ multiattribute preference theory in the design of incentive plans. The basic idea is to state empirically verifiable conditions on the decision maker's preferences that imply some particular form of the incentive function. First, we show how an incentive plan can be devised when incentive compensation to managers is based on their actual performance on some predetermined criteria. Next, we consider goal-based plans that encourage managers to set accurate goals and motivate them to strive for a better performance subsequent to goal setting. Finally, we extend the goal-based plans to include situations in which the goals are reported probabilistically. Several suggestions for further research are also provided.

## 7. Formulating Blood Rotation Policies with Multiple Objectives
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
Human blood is perishable. Therefore it must be systematically redistributed to hospital blood banks where it will have a high probability of transfusion. Ideally this redistribution, referred to as blood rotation, should be performed in such a manner as to minimze the outdating and improve the quality of blood while keeping the frequency of blood shortages and regional operating costs at reasonable levels. Priorities for attaining these multiple objectives are different in every blood region. Consequently, in this paper, a goal programming model is developed to attain multiple goals as identified by the administrator of a regional blood center. Included in the model are goal constraints related to inventory levels, the availability of fresh blood, blood outdating, the age of the blood, and the cost of collecting it. The paper reports the results of applying the methodology in a large urban-rural blood region in the midwest. Use of the model demonstrated that:
the percentage of blood collected for use within the region but not used could be reduced from 14.9% to 9.2% without increasing the frequncy of shortages;
overstocking of hospital blood banks would be eliminated;
sufficient fresh blood could be made available to meet the needs of special surgery;
the amount of blood needed to be collected for use within the region could be reduced by over 5%, saving approximately $115,000 per year.

## 8. The Demand for a Risky Asset
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
We investigate the effect on the demand for a risky asset when there are changes in either initial wealth or one of the asset return distributions in two asset expected utility portfolio problems. In the choice between a risky and a safe asset necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for first, second and third degree stochastic dominance shifts to yield increasing demand for the risky asset. The conditions may be illustrated graphically and used to demonstrate that many common utility functions fail to satisfy the increasing demand property. The results extend and generalize the analysis in Fishburn and Porter (Fishburn, P. C., R. B. Porter. 1976. Optimal portfolios with one safe and one risky asset: effects of changes in rate of return and risk. Management Sci.22 10641073.). In the two risky asset case sufficient conditions are presented for there to be an increase in the demand for one of the risky assets if either initial wealth is increased or this asset has a first degree stochastic dominance shift. The conditions, which build upon and extend earlier results of Arrow (Arrow, K. J. 1971. Essays in the Theory of Risk Bearing. Markham, Chicago, Ill.) and Cass and Stiglitz (Cass, D., J. E. Stiglitz. 1972. Risk aversion and wealth effects on portfolios with many assets. Rev. Econom. Studies39 331354.), may be used to determine which utility functions display the increasing demand properties.

## 9. Automatic Identification of Generalized Upper Bounds in Large-Scale Optimization Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
To solve contemporary large-scale linear, integer and mixed integer programming problems, it is often necessary to exploit intrinsic special structure in the model at hand. One commonly used technique is to identify and then to exploit in a basis factorization algorithm a generalized upper bound (GUB) structure. This report compares several existing methods for identifying GUB structure. Computer programs have been written to permit comparison of computational efficiency. The GUB programs have been incorporated in an existing optimization system of advanced design and have been tested on a variety of large-scale real-life optimization problems. The identification of GUB sets of maximum size is shown to be among the class of NP-complete problems; these problems are widely conjectured to be intractable in that no polynomial-time algorithm has been demonstrated for solving them. All the methods discussed in this report are polynomial-time heuristic algorithms that attempt to find, but do not guarantee, GUB sets of maximum size. Bounds for the maximum size of GUB sets are developed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms.

## 10. NoteOn A New Look at Production Switching Heuristics for the Aggregate Planning Problem
### Author(s):
- Roger C. Vergin
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1980
### Abstract:
Several papers have been published which present simplified models for the aggregate planning problem which do not yield optimal schedules. They are typically supported with computations that suggest that the resulting schedules produce costs within a few percent of optimum. This note suggests that those cost comparisons have been made against inappropriate base costs which include a large fixed cost element. When these models are compared using only the controllable variable costs, costs that appeared to be only one or two percent over minimum turn out to be as much as twenty to thirty percent over the costs resulting from optimal solutions.
