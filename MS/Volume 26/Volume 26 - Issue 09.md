## 1. Review of Data Related to Energy Use in Residential and Commercial Buildings
### Author(s):
- Eric Hirst
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
This paper reviews data dealing with energy use in residential and commercial buildings and their determinants. Three types of data are discussed: data prepared by and for the federal government on overall trends in buildings energy use, data prepared by and for the federal government related to the details of energy use, and data collected at the state and utility level.

## 2. Diagnostic Analysis of a Production and Distribution System
### Author(s):
- Arnoldo C. Hax
- Nicolas S. Majluf
- Mark Pendrock
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
This paper reports on a diagnostic study completed by a large firm in the consumer goods sector. This study is aimed at evaluating the production and distribution planning system, the quality of the forecasting system, and the existing levels of inventory. Aggregate models are presented to assess opportunities for improvements in those areas. A proposal for the design of a new production and distribution system, that follows a hierarchical approach, is reviewed. Recommendations for managerial actions are discussed.

## 3. Optimal Resource Allocation Between Spot and Package Demands

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of allocating fixed resources between two types of demands; (a) spot demand; and (b) package (subscription) demanddemand that is satisfied by selling usage rights over a prespecified time period prior to actual consumption. In Model 1, a probabilistic spot demand for a single resource, stationary over time, is assumed together with externally determined spot and package pricing. It is shown that the optimal (profit maximizing) policy is to sell all the packages in the first period and the optimal number of packages to offer is derived. Model 1 is extended to the case when the package offers rights to any one of a number M of resources at a given time; similar conclusions are obtained. In Model 2, package price is considered to be a decision variable. It is shown that the optimal price should be monotonically nondecreasing over time, implying that the number of packages offered for sale each period will not increase over time. Finally, managerial uses of the proposed models for entertainment, leisure and tourist services are reviewed.

## 4. Expected Utility and the Truncated Normal Distribution
### Author(s):
- R. Norgaard
- T. Killeen
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
This article demonstrates that: (1) When a normally distributed decision variable is combined with an analytic utility function (one with derivatives of all orders and a power series expansion involving those derivatives), the expected utility can be expressed in powers of  and 2. (2) In the case of the normal model, when the tails of the distribution do not reflect reality in the mind of a decision-maker, a truncated normal model is a possible alternative. (3) If the appropriate model is the truncated normal distribution, then the expected utility is approximately a linear function of  and  for several important classes of risk averse utility functions. (4) The negative exponential is an especially useful utility function since it has a simple closed form for both the truncated and nontruncated models, and since it gives an ordering similar to those of the log, arctangent or power utility functions.

## 5. A Framework for Research in Computer-Based Management Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Blake Ives
- Scott Hamilton
- Gordon B. Davis
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
The paper presents a comprehensive framework for research in Management Information Systems (MIS). The necessity for a more comprehensive research framework is derived from a review of past research frameworks. The new framework is validated by mapping 331 MIS doctoral dissertations into its research categories. The dissertations are also classified by research methodology employed.

## 6. Multiple-Object, Discriminatory Auctions with Bidding Constraints: A Game-Theoretic Analysis
### Author(s):
- Thomas R. Palfrey
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
This paper examines the existence and characterization of pure strategy Nash equilibria in multiple-object auction games in which buyers face a binding constraint on exposure. There are five major results. First, symmetric Nash equilibria exist if and only if there are two or less buyers and two or less items. Second, a Nash equilibrium may not exist if the seller sets a positive reservation bid. Third, asymmetric solutions to symmetrically parameterized games typically involve high-low strategies: each buyer submits positive bids only on some restricted subset of the items. Fourth, Nash equilibria typically generate zero surplus to the buyers. Fifth, when asymmetric solutions exist and the buyers are identical, these solutions are never unique.

## 7. NoteOn the Marginal Benefit of Adding Servers to G/GI/m Queues
### Author(s):
- Richard R. Weber
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
The mean queueing time in a G/GI/m queue is shown to be a nonincreasing and convex function of the number of servers, m. This means that the marginal decrease in mean queueing time brought about by the addition of two extra servers is always less than twice the decrease brought about by the addition of one extra server. As a consequence, a method of marginal analysis is optimal for allocating a number of servers amongst several service facilities so as to minimize the sum of die mean queueing times at the facilities.

## 9. NoteComments on a Queueing Inequality
### Author(s):
- Daniel P. Heyman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1980
### Abstract:
In a G/G/c/N system (a queue with general distributions of inter-arrival and service time, c servers and N  c  0 queueing positions), let B be the steady-state probability that an arriving customer finds all queue positions filled and p be the time average probability that all queue positions are filled. By assuming p = B, Matthew Sobel proved
where p is the traffic intensity. He also showed, by numerical examples, that the lower bound is a good approximation when p  1.5 and c  2.
