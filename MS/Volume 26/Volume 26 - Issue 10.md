## 1. A Quasi-Empirical Mapping of Optimal Scale of Enterprise
### Author(s):
- John W. Sutherland
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
There is a substantial empirical data base suggesting that increases in organizational size and complexity tend to be accompanied by decreases in strict economic efficiency. There has, however, been no attempt to provide a generalized explanation for these results, or to asses their macroeconomic implications. Here we attempt to do this, focussing initially on the limited bounds of rationality the management sciences can currently make available. When these are considered, the efficiency disadvantages of large-scale, highly diversified firms become intelligible as follows: When an organization enlarges itself primarily through diversification, it becomes increasingly susceptible to certain administrative diseconomies; beyond some point, these more than offset efficiencies available through size-related economies of scale. There is, in effect, some optimal scale of enterprise, violations of which force a firm to disserve its customers, investors or the general economic welfare.

## 2. The Impact of the Mode of Information Presentation on Learning and Performance

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
A logistics management game was modified to provide an information/decision system that would serve as a framework for experimentally investigating the impact of the mode of information presentation. Subjects played the game by making a series of weekly decisions during each of two playing sessions. The experimental treatments were varied between sessions to permit the testing of a set of hypotheses pertaining to the impact that information and its mode of presentation might have upon performance and the rate of performance change. Data on player decisions and simulated results (performance) were collected automatically by the modified gaming system while data on player backgrounds were collected via questionnaires.

## 3. Models for Affirmative Action Planning and Evaluation
### Author(s):
- David S. P. Hopkins
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
Two models are presented as aids in setting realistic numerical goals for the employment of women and minority persons, and in evaluating progress towards meeting such goals. By modelling personnel flows in terms of hiring and persistence rates for various job categories, we develop a consistent structure for projecting future employment patterns as a function of hiring goals. These hiring goals themselves are made to depend on the growth-rate of staff size, the relative availability of women and minority candidates in the potential pool of job applicants, and the organization's policies towards equity in hiring.

## 4. Problems in Predicting New Product Growth for Consumer Durables
### Author(s):

- Thomas P. Hustad
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
A popular model of new product diffusion is applied in an international setting. Several limitations on its use are noted: instability with limited data, environmental differences, and systematic under reporting of estimated time to attain peak level of first purchase sales.

## 5. Managerial Response to Technological Innovation in Public Sector Organizations
### Author(s):
- Irwin Feller
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
Technological innovation is widely seen as a means for raising productivity levels in state and local government. Growing evidence indicates that (1) senior level bureaucrats have primary responsibility for decisions concerning the adoption of innovations, and (2) innovations adopted by state and local governments are of two typescost-reducing and service-augmenting. A formal explanation is advanced for the apparent preference of bureaucrats for service-augmenting innovations. Service-augmenting innovations tend to increase agency budgets to which bureaucratic emoluments are positively correlated, to expand the clientele served by an agency, and to obscure agency production costs by simultaneously altering both the input mixes and the services being provided.

## 6. Long-Term Dependence and Least Squares Regression in Investment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Myron T. Greene
- Bruce D. Fielitz
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
It is widely assumed that common stock returns approximate a random walk, i.e., the returns are assumed to be serially independent. As a consequence, estimates of systematic risk and efficient portfolios are usually developed using any convenient differencing interval with the implication that they are applicable to any investor regardless of his horizon period. This paper derives the relationships between least-squares estimators and the differencing interval in the presence of long-term dependence. These relationships are then used to show how long-term dependence affects estimates of systematic risk and efficient portfolios selected with the Sharpe index model. The major implication is that, because of long-term dependence, systematic risk estimates and efficient portfolios must be developed using a differencing interval exactly equal to the investor's horizon period.

## 7. Translation of Gambles and Aspiration Level Effects in Risky Choice Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
Two recent models of risky decision making developed by Fishburn (Fishbijrn, P. C. 1977. Mean-risk analysis with risk associated with below-target returns. Amer. Econ. Rev.67 116126.) and by Kahneman and Tversky (Kahneman, D., A. Tversky. 1979. Prospect theory: an analysis of decisions under risk. Econometrica47 262291.) have emphasized the importance of a target return or a reference point in determining preferences and choices among gambles. Target returns and reference points represent variations on the concept of an aspiration level, an old idea in theories of decision making. Additional evidence on the need to incorporate such a concept in the analysis of risky choice behavior is presented in this paper. In three experiments, the relationship of pairs of gambles to an assumed reference point was varied by adding or subtracting a constant amount from all outcomes. The results demonstrate that such translations of outcomes can result in the reversal of choice within pairs of gambles. The effect of such translations on choice depended on whether the size of the translation was sufficient to insure that one gamble in a pair had outcome values either all above or all below the reference point, while the other gamble had outcome values both above and below the reference point. A model of the effects of a reference point on risky choice behavior is presented and the results are also discussed in terms of the Fishburn and Kahneman-Tversky models, as well as other theories of risky decision making.

## 8. NotePlanning for Industrial Estate Development in a Developing Economy
### Author(s):
- C. O. Fong
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1980
### Abstract:
Since the early 1970s, it has been realized that rapid economic development in developing countries leads to an acute inequality in income distribution. To prevent massive dissatisfaction among their citizens, developing countries were urged to achieve economic growth (particularly industrial growth) with distribution of income as their development goal. A good way of promoting growth and dispersal of industrial activities is the establishment of industrial estates in the locations where such activities are desired. This paper formulates the problem of optimal development of industrial estates, with the incorporation of specified minimum levels of development in poverty (priority) sites as distributive targets, as encountered by a Malaysian state government. The linear programming problem so formulated is then shown to be equivalent to a transportation problem, enabling it to be solved and parametically analyzed efficiently. Computational results, obtained using real-life data, show that the subsidy incurred in fulfilling the distributive targets is small compared to the total revenue generated. This justifies the imposition of the distributive targets on the development process. Further, the optimal policy was found to involve decisions to be taken in the initial years of the planning horizon that are fairly insensitive to variation in demand and cost parameters, thereby demonstrating the relative goodness of the optimal policy for industrial estate development in the state.
