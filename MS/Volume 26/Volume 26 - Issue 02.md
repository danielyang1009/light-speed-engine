## 1. State of the ArtAuctions and Bidding Models: A Survey
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
Auctions and bidding models are attracting an ever increasing amount of attention. The Stark and Rothkopf (Stark, R. M., M. H. Rothkopf. 1979. Competitive bidding: a comprehensive bibliography. Oper. Res.27 (2) 364390.) bibliography includes approximately 500 works in the area. Additional work has appeared since the bibliography was compiled.

## 2. A Stochastic Constrained Optimization Model for Determining Commercial Fishing Seasons
### Author(s):
- Norman Gaither
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
Fisheries management must set fishing seasons that define either length of season, amount of seasonal catch, or both. These seasons are traditionally set with one overriding concernprotect the bio-mass of the fishery. In this paper, a stochastic constrained optimization model is developed for a multi-species fishery that sets the seasonal catch by species, by geographical area, and by month of the season. The model maximizes vessel fleet contribution over a one year planning horizon within certain biological, environmental, market, and production capacity constraints.

## 3. First-Offer Bargains
### Author(s):
- William Samuelson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
In the well-known model of bilateral monopoly a single seller of a good faces a single potential buyer. Frequently, each party will be uncertain about the other's reservation price. Thus, in making a price offer each faces a trade-off between his individual gains (if a bargain is successful) and the probability that a mutually acceptable bargain is concluded. This paper focuses on the implications of a bargaining rule that calls for one party to make the first and final offer, the other to accept or reject it. As one would expect, the buyer offer strategy involves shading. (quoting of an offer below his true reservation price for the good) while the seller employs a markup offer strategy. The offer strategy of each party is nondecreasing in the individual's reservation price. Furthermore, a uniformly more optimistic assessment of the opponent's reservation price (in the special sense of stochastic dominance) induces a less truthful offer from the individual. While the relative efficiency of the buyer and seller first-offer procedures must be examined on a case-by-case basis, it can be shown that the opportunity to make the first and final offer always confers a distinct bargaining advantage.

## 4. An Analysis of Utilization Differences for Scientific and Technical Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to provide further insight into the process of scientific and technical information transfer. We present and analyze results of data gathered over a two year period from more than 300 engineers and scientists employed at five major U.S. corporations (Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Monsanto, Exxon, and G. D. Searle). We consider a variety of factors along the axes of task to be performed and information characteristics and analyze differences in the use of information as a function of these factors. Many interesting results emerge, with important managerial implications.

## 5. On the Design of Incentives in Business FirmsA Survey of Some Research
### Author(s):
- L. Peter Jennergren
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
Quantitative approaches to the design of incentives in business firms are surveyed by drawing on writings from management science, finance, decision analysis, and mathematical economics. Two general incentive design situations are considered: How should incentives for the company president be designed, so that he or she will be induced to act in the interest of the ownership group or some other controlling syndicate? And how should incentives for divisions be designed, so that they will be induced to act in accordance with the interest of the whole firm? With respect to the first question, the following topics are discussed: the construction of an objective function for the firm derived through die stock market or directly from the preferences of the members of the controlling syndicate, the principal-agent situation, and the moral hazard situation. With respect to the second question, two topics are treated: the Soviet incentive scheme, and resource allocation.

## 6. Scheduling Jobs on Two Facilities to Minimize Makespan
### Author(s):
- R. L. Bulfin
- R. G. Parker
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1980
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the problem of scheduling tasks on a system consisting of two parallel processors in order that makespan be minimized. In particular, we treat a variety of modifications to this basic theme, including the cases of identical, proportional, and unrelated processors. In addition, a heuristic scheme is suggested when precedence constraints exist where such constraints may be assignment dependent. Substantial computational experience is reported in all cases where it would appear that relatively large problems can be handled routinely.
