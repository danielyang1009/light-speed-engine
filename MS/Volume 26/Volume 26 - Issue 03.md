## 1. Turnpike Horizons for Production Planning
### Author(s):
- Gerald L. Thompson
- Suresh P. Sethi
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
A quadratic model for production-inventory planning was made famous by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon in 1960 in (Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, J. F. Muth, H. A. Simon. 1960. Planning Production, Inventories, and Work Force. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.), especially for its application to a paint factory. A discrete control version of a related quadratic production-inventory model was studied by Kleindorfer, Kriebel, Thompson, and Kleindorfer in (Kleindorfer, P. R., C. H. Kriebel, G. L. Thompson, G. B. Kleindorfer. 1975. Discrete optimal control of production plans. Management Sci.22 261273.).

## 2. Integer Programming Models for Sales Resource Allocation
### Author(s):
- Andris A. Zoltners
- Prabhakant Sinha
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
A practical conceptual framework for sales resource allocation modeling is presented in this paper. A literature review of sales resource allocation models is described in terms of this framework. The conceptual framework also lends itself to several integer programming models which may be used to address the variety of sales resource allocation decisions faced by every sales organization. A general model for sales resource allocation is developed which incorporates multiple sales resources, multiple time periods and carryover effects, non-separability, and risk.

## 3. A Competitive Scenario Modeling System
### Author(s):
- Biplab K. Dutta
- William R. King
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
A competitive decision support system that has been utilized in a pilot version in a corporate application is described and evaluated. The system is based on the combining of meta-game analysis with a number of mathematical market models. The system facilitates the testing of proposed competitive scenarios for stability and permits the consequences of scenarios to be predicted in the market share, profit and other terms that are familiar to manager users. Although the formal evaluation of the system is not clearly positive, both the system and the evaluation procedure appear to have substantial potential.

## 4. A Lagrangean Relaxation Algorithm for the Two Duty Period Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Fred Shepardson
- Roy E. Marsten
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
The two duty period scheduling problem is an integer programming problem with 0-1 constraint coefficients. It is recognized that the problem can be reformulated as a one duty period problem with side constraints. Since the one duty period problem can be solved as a minimal cost network flow problem, we dualize with respect to the side constraints, forming a Lagrangean relaxation which is easily solved. Subgradient optimization is used to maximize the Lagrangean. Computational results are reported for several large problems.

## 5. An Implicit Enumeration Algorithm for Quadratic Integer Programming
### Author(s):
- R. D. McBride
- J. S. Yormark
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
We present an implicit enumeration algorithm for a nonseparable quadratic integer programming problem. We utilize fathoming criteria derived from Lemke's complementary pivot algorithm, and compare the use of pseudo-costs versus generalized penalties as a guide to branching. Computational experience is provided.

## 6. An Economics Approach to Modeling the Productivity of Computer Systems
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Kriebei
- Artur Raviv
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
The problem of linking computing and information services to end user needs for performance evaluation has been a long standing issue in the systems literature. A joint university-industry research project was begun in 1975 to better understand the problem. The specific goals of the project have been: (1) to develop a theory or conceptual framework for productivity measurement of the computing and information services function, (2) to pilot test the theory through empirical analysis at field sites, and (3) to evaluate the results and report the conclusions (success and failure). This paper is addressed to the first of these goals; the empirical tests and experience based on the framework are reported in a sequel paper.

## 7. Implicit Intransitivity Under Majority Rule with Mixed Motions
### Author(s):
- Merrill M. Flood
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1980
### Abstract:
When several persons organized as a group are to choose one from among several specified alternatives they may make use of majority voting or some other decision-making process. This paper considers the case in which the decision process includes among the alternatives some that are probability mixtures of others. Examples are presented to illustrate the way in which a situation that is transitive under majority voting rule becomes intransitive when mixtures of the same alternatives are permitted. If utility product maximization is used to determine the group choice, as an agreed upon arbitration process when utilities are assigned to the alternatives by each group member but without interpersonal comparability, some examples are presented to illustrate the results of this method. It is reasoned that some such method is often clearly preferable to majority voting in order both to allot more appropriate influence to minorities and to accommodate for differences in importance of alternatives beyond those represented by individual rank orderings.
