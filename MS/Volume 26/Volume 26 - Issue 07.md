## 1. Marketing Applications of the Analytic Hierarchy Process
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1980
### Abstract:
Several marketing applications of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are reviewed. The paper starts with a brief description of this process, which was developed by Thomas Saaty in 1971, including an eight-point outline of how to apply it. The thrust of the paper is a discussion of a number of illustrative applications of the AHP covering the following areas:
the portfolio decisions of a firm whose management is concerned with the determination of the desired target portfolio and allocation of resources among its components,
determination of the directions for new product development, and
generation and evaluation of marketing mix strategies.

## 2. Modeling and Resolution of the Medium Term Energy Generation Planning Problem for a Large Hydro-Electric System

### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the modeling and resolution of the energy generation planning problem of a large hydroelectric system for a horizon up to two years, with emphasis on hydro plant generation, hydro system aggregation, and objective function modeling. The problem has been formulated as a deterministic discrete-time optimal control problem, with linear transition equations, a highly nonlinear objective, and bounds on both the state and the control variables. The solution algorithm is of the reduced gradient type, with the control variables nonbasic to provide good conditioning. Because of the linear relationship between the state and control variables, the set of feasible directions at a point is a polyhedral convex cone and the bounds both on the state and control variables can be accounted for by means of an algorithm for the orthogonal projection of the gradient on the cone. Some computational experience with this large-scale non-linear program is given, followed by a discussion of implementation.

### Abstract:
A class of production planning problems is considered in which known demands have to be satisfied over a finite horizon at minimum total costs. For each period, production and storage cost functions are specified. The production costs may include set-up costs and the production levels may he subject to capacity limits. The computational complexity of the problems in this class is investigated. Several algorithms proposed for their solution are described and analyzed. It is also shown that some special cases are NP-hard and hence unlikely to be solvable in polynomial time.

## 4. The Effects of Promotion by Seniority in Growth-Constrained Organizations
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Stanford
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1980
### Abstract:
This paper develops a balanced growth fractional flow model for the opportunities for promotion, length of service, and career earnings of personnel in a hierarchical manpower organization, and relates these characteristics to the expenditures needed to maintain the system for a specified period of operation. The primary controls available in the model are the proportions of rank members promoted to higher ranks during each period, the proportions of personnel in each rank who are promoted on the basis of seniority, and the growth rate of the sire of the system.

## 5. Linear Multiple Objective Problems with Interval Coefficients
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1980
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider linear multiple objective programs with coefficients of the criteria given by intervals. This class of problems is of practical interest since in many instances it is difficult to determine precisely the coefficients of the objective functions. A subproblem to test if a feasible extreme point is efficient in the problem considered is obtained. A branch and bound algorithm to solve the subproblem as well as computational results are provided. Extensions are discussed.

## 6. A Decision Analysis Model for a Serious Medical Problem
### Author(s):
- Daniel Pea Sanchez de Rivera
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1980
### Abstract:
This paper presents a decision model for a serious medical problem: the diagnosis and treatment of undifferentiated liver disease with jaundice. The model formalizes the use of information before a treatment is chosen, taking account of prior information collected by the doctor from laboratory and clinical exploration. Then the model chooses the best treatment according to the patient's preference structure.

## 7. A Boolean Approach to Interactive Program Planning
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Program planning refers to the process of selecting an integrated set of projects for implementation. Ultimately, decisions tend to be political in the sense that they involve compromises and tradeoffs among different interests, though the arguments may be couched in technical terms. Program planning may be structured as a multi-stage process. One stage involves the assessment of various alternatives for the project components of the program. A second stage then involves the selection of the required program, i.e., a specific combination of project designs. This paper presents a Boolean method called Interactive Program Planning (IPP) for structuring the assessment process at the project level. The method may be used in an interactive procedure that finds which project alternatives are acceptable to different interest groups. An algorithm that identifies crucial points of disagreement between groups may then be used to help reduce disagreements, thus enlarging the set of acceptable programs. Although the focus here is on program planning, the method is of general relevance to complex issues involving collective decisions. Further, IPP implies the view that optimization methods requiring (a perhaps implicit) consensus on general objectives are of limited value as general frameworks for program planning. Instead (or in addition) the program planning process should be supported by interactive methods that can assist in achieving the widespread acceptance of specific alternatives which meet a variety of perhaps conflicting interests.

## 8. Some New Branching and Bounding Criteria for the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem
### Author(s):
- Giorgio Carpaneto
- Paolo Toth
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1980
### Abstract:
Many algorithms have been developed for the optimal solution of the asymmetric travelling salesman problem: the most efficient ones are based on the subtour elimination approach. This paper presents a breadth-first branch and bound algorithm which differs from the method of Smith, Srinivasan and Thompson in the selection of the subtour to be split, in the ordering of the arcs in the selected subtour, in the computation of different partial lower bounds and in different data structures to facilitate the updating of the cost matrix. Extensive computational results considering random problems with up to 240 vertices are presented for various ranges of the coefficients of the cost matrix.
