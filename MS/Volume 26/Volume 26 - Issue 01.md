## 1. Worst-Case Analysis of Heuristic Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Marshall L. Fisher
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
The increased focus on heuristics for the approximate solution of integer programs has led to more sophisticated analysis methods for studying their performance. This paper is concerned with the worst-case approach to the analysis of heuristic performance. A worst-case study establishes the maximum deviation from optimality that can occur when a specified heuristic is applied within a given problem class. This is an important piece of information that can be combined with empirical testing and other analyses to provide a more complete evaluation of a heuristic. In this paper the basic ground rules of worst-case analysis of heuristics are reviewed, and a large variety of the existing types of worst-case results are described in terms of the knapsack problem. A selected sample of results for four other problems is given. The paper concludes with a discussion of possibilities for further research.

## 2. A Coverage Function for Interval Estimators of Simulation Response
### Author(s):
- Lee W. Schruben
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
The coverage function presented here measures confidence interval robustness. It is suggested that this function be used in the analysis of empirical interval estimator studies. Some approaches for determining appropriate sample sizes in such experiments are also discussed. A short study of two procedures for constructing confidence intervals for a simulation response is offered as an example.

## 3. Technological ForecastingAn Overview
### Author(s):
- Joseph P. Martino
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
Within the past decade, the set of techniques used by technological forecasters has expanded considerably. While the old standbys such as trend extrapolation are still in wide use, some new techniques are also beginning to see wide use. In addition, there are some new techniques which have considerable promise, but which have not yet seen wide use. Finally, there are some techniques which have not yet fulfilled their original promise. Examples of each of these categories are discussed in the paper.

## 4. Simple Ranking Methods for Allocation of One Resource
### Author(s):
- Paul H. Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
This paper considers optimization problems with a nonlinear-additive objective function and a single linear constraint. Such models have numerous direct applications and serve as subproblems in procedures for more complex problems. Some important portfolio selection problems can be expressed in this form, and the problem also arises in economic theory.

## 5. R&D Project Planning with Q-GERT Network Modeling and Simulation
### Author(s):
- Bernard W. Taylor, III
- Laurence J. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation study of two cases of research and development planning. The first case is for a series of R&D projects analyzed sequentially by a single R&D team, while the second case is for a series of R&D projects analyzed sequentially and concurrently by two teams. Q-GERT, a network technique, was employed for the modeling and simulation effort. This technique includes numerous network modeling capabilities which make it more applicable to R&D project planning than traditional network techniques such as CPM and PERT. The simulation results for each case in terms of project duration statistics and outcome probabilities are presented in detail. The trade-offs between the two cases (i.e., single team versus multiple team analysis) are discussed.

## 6. Consumer Preference Judgments: An Exposition with Empirical Applications
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
The modeling of preferences for multiattribute alternatives has received an increased attention in marketing (consumer behavior) and management science (decision analysis). The research in the two disciplines is closely related and can be applied to predicting consumer preferences for multiattribute options. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate and discuss several preference models and measurement techniques that have been used mainly by decision analysts and which are applicable in the consumer preference judgment context. A pilot application of the measurement techniques which provides some insight on their relative predictive accuracy and on the usefulness of empirically verifying the conditions necessary for the existence of the preference models is reported, too.

## 7. A Longitudinal Model to Decompose the Effects of an Advertising Stimulus on Family Consumption
### Author(s):
- Russell S. Winer
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
A general model describing individual consuming unit response to an advertising stimulus is developed. The measure of behavior utilized is consumption. In the model, the various effects of advertising on behavior are decomposed. These are price-advertising interactions, transitory or short-run effects, and permanent or long-term effects. Specific parameterized forms of the model demonstrate how alternative theories of the effects of advertising can be tested.

## 8. Pivot and ComplementA Heuristic for 0-1 Programming
### Author(s):
- Egon Balas
- Clarence H. Martin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
Pivot and Complement is a heuristic for finding approximate solutions to 0-1 programming problems. It uses the fact that a 0-1 program is equivalent to the associated linear program with the added requirement that all slack variables, other than those in the upper bounding constraints, be basic. The procedure starts by solving the linear program; then performs a sequence of pivots aimed at putting all slacks into the basis at a minimal cost; finally, it attempts to improve the 0-1 solution obtained in this way by a local search based on complementing certain sets of 0-1 variables. The computational effort involved in the procedure is bounded by a polynomial in the number of constraints and variables. For the 92 test problems with 5 to 200 constraints and 20 to 900 variables on which the procedure was run, the time used to solve the linear program on the average considerably exceeded the time used for everything else. As to the quality of the solutions obtained, in 45 cases, or 49% of the total, the procedure found an optimal solution; for the capital budgeting problems (positive coefficients everywhere), the solution found was on the average within 0.15% of the optimum; for 81 of the 92 problems, it was within 1% of the optimum; and only in 1 case did the procedure not find a feasible solution.

## 9. NoteA Comment on Modeling the Marketing Mix Decision for Industrial Products
### Author(s):
- Paul W. Farris
- Robert D. Buzzell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
A recent article by Lilien (Lilien, Gary L. 1979. ADVISOR 2: Modeling the marketing mix decision for industrial products. Management Sci.25 (February) 191204.) reports the principal findings of the ADVISOR 2 project, in which regression models are used to explain levels of advertising and marketing expenditures by industrial product manufacturers. Lilien compares ADVISOR results with some analyses of PIMS data which we reported in 1976 (Buzzell, Robert D., Paul W. Farris. 1977. Marketing costs in consumer goods industries. Hans Thorelli, ed. Strategy + Structure = Performance. Indiana University Press, 122145.), and states that  the results of the Buzzell-Farris study on the PIMS data and the results of ADVISOR are quite consistent. We cannot agree with this conclusion. We believe there are important inconsistencies between the two studies, which should be considered by anyone who might use the ADVISOR modelor the PIMS-based modelsto evaluate actual marketing budgets.

## 10. Reply to Farris and Buzzell's Comment on ADVISOR 2 Paper
### Author(s):
- Gary L. Lilien
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
Farris and Buzzell's (Farris, Paul W., Robert D. Buzzell. A comment on modeling the marketing mix decision for industrial products. Management Sci. this issue.) comment on my (Liuen, Gary L. 1979. ADVISOR 2: Modeling the marketing mix decision for industrial products. Management Sci.25 191204.) paper on the ADVISOR studies and its relationship to their work with the PIMS data calls for clarification of the methodology, objectives and results of both studies. We will show that the ADVISOR models present strong evidence in favor of a descriptive model of advertising/sales expenditures that is not constant with the dollar level of sales. This directly addresses the contention by Farris and Buzzell that modeling the A/S ratio as a constant is theoretically and empirically valid. We then explore some of the differences between the Farris-Buzzell analyses and ADVISOR that are important in understanding where and why the results differ. Next we elaborate on some of the validation analyses done for ADVISOR. Finally, we discuss in more detail the reasons for handling product profitability through a variable called product plans in the ADVISOR model.

## 11. NoteAnalysis of Time Series with Calendar Effects
### Author(s):
- Lon-Mu Liu
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
Most national economic data and many marketing series are compiled monthly according to the Gregorian Calendar, but some of the ancient festivals or holidays, such as Easter, Jewish Passover, and Chinese New Year, are set by lunar calendar. Therefore the date of a holiday may vary between two adjacent months from year to year. Some product marketing and consumer behavior patterns are closely related to such holidays; the amount of monthly sales may change as the date of the holiday changes from one month to the other. This paper shows how calendar intervention influences the sample autocorrelation, both by a theoretical study and an actual example. Model estimation for a time series subject to calendar intervention is also discussed.

## 12. NoteThe Single Facility Minimax Distance Problem Under Stochastic Location of Demand
### Author(s):
- Robert Carbone
- Abraham Mehrez
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1980
### Abstract:
This note extends the minimum maximum distance single facility location problem to situations where the locations of prospective demand points are considered to be random variables. Two types of decision are analyzed for this setting under the assumption of independent and identical normal distributions with the same means: locating on the basis of an expected value criterion or adopting a wait-and-see policy. Through the concept of the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), it is shown for one-dimensional location decisions that a substantial reduction in maximum distance may be realized by the adoption of a wait-and-see policy.
