## 1. Testing for Vision Loss in Glaucoma Suspects
### Author(s):
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
The problem of decreasing the amount of testing for vision loss in persons susceptible to glaucoma is formulated as an integer optimization problem. Nonlinear and linear versions of the problem formulation are given, and both heuristic and exact algorithms are proposed. Testing with retrospective clinical data indicates that the suggested procedures can yield substantial improvement in testing time. The relation of the glaucoma testing problem to classical problems in search theory is briefly discussed.

## 2. PBDS: A Decision Support System for Regional Blood Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
Human blood is a perishable product: in the U.S. it has a legal lifetime of 21 days from collection, during which it can be used for transfusion to a patient of the same type, and after which it has to be discarded. It is collected in units of one pint from volunteer donors at various collection sites such as a Regional Blood Center, and after a series of typing and screening tests it is shipped to Hospital Blood Banks in the region. Once at the Hospital Blood Bank, a unit is stored and is available to satisfy the random daily demand for transfusions to patients. Since not all units demanded for a patient are generally used, a unit can be issued several times during its lifetime until transfused or outdated.

## 3. The Diffusion of an Administrative Innovation
### Author(s):
- David J. Teece
### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
This paper examines the diffusion of a particular kind of multidivisional administrative structurethe M-Formin two classes of large industrial firms. The M-Form organization is a multidivisional structure with quasi-independent divisions which are assigned profit center standing and which are monitored and guided by a headquarters organization. A simple deterministic model commonly employed to represent the diffusion of technological innovations is utilized to explain the diffusion of the M-Form structure. The commendable performance of the model suggests that additional insights from the study of technological innovation can be applied with advantage to the study of administrative innovation.

## 4. Estimation of a Longitudinal Model to Decompose the Effects of an Advertising Stimulus on Family Consumption
### Author(s):
- Russell S. Winer
### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
A model which separates the various effects of an advertising experiment on a family's consumption behavior is estimated using consumer panel data. It is determined that there were significant transitory or short-run effects of the advertising, while permanent influences and price-advertising interactions were negligible. Implications of both the empirical results for management and the modeling approach for market researchers are discussed.

## 5. Are Multi-Echelon Inventory Methods Worth Implementing in Systems with Low-Demand-Rate Items?
### Author(s):
- John A. Muckstadt
- L. Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
In practice, most multi-echelon inventory systems are managed using adaptations of single location methods. This paper shows that such methods can be dramatically inferior to methods designed to take advantage of a system's structure. This is especially true in repair parts inventory systems where most items have low demand rates.

## 6. Solving Large-Scale Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problems to Optimality
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
We report the solution to optimality of ten large-scale symmetric travelling salesman problems. The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the standard problems of the Operations Research/Management Science literature and is cited in virtually every textbook on this subject. The TSP is a hard combinatorial optimization problem for which to date no technically good algorithm is known. All known algorithmic approaches to the TSP that are amenable to a worst-case analysis have yielded nothing for this problem that is as satisfactory as the existing solution procedures for, as an example, flow problems in networks. Furthermore, recent theoretical work has shown that the TSP is algorithmically equivalent to the general zero-one decision problem with linear constraints and objective function. The phrase This problem is as hard as a travelling salesman problem reflects this fact and expresses the slim chances of finding an optimal solution to the problem at hand. It is therefore all the more surprising that in the current study, all of the test problems were solved to optimalityi.e., the proposed methodology did not fail on any one of the ten large-scale test problems of the computational study. Besides being a prototype of a difficult combinatorial optimization problem, the travelling salesman problem has a variety of applications in its own right, mostly in the areas of production management, vehicle routing, and vehicle scheduling. A number of related problems, such as, for example, the multiple travelling salesman problem with m travelling salesmen located at a central depot and with fixed charges for their deployment, have been shown elsewhere to fit the standard form of the TSP treated in this paper.

## 8. A Mathematical Programming Approach to Beef Feedlot Optimization
### Author(s):
- John J. Glen
### Published:
- 1 May 1980
### Abstract:
The efficient operation of a beef cattle feedlot is governed by the purchase and selling weights and prices of the animals and by the feeding system used. The optimal feeding system will involve feeding least cost rations to animals at every stage in the production process. A method is described for determining optimal feeding systems which meet the nutrient standards recommended by the US National Research Council. The approach involves first using linear programming (LP) to determine least cost rations to produce specified liveweight gains in animals of known liveweight. Dynamic programming (DP) is then used to determine the optimal sequence of rations to feed in order to produce animals of specified liveweight from animals of known initial weight at minimum cost, using the least cost rations determined from the LP model. The results from this new DP model can then be used to determine the optimal combination of purchase weight, selling weight and feeding system. It is shown that in order to use the DP model, the LP model must be solved a large number of times and a new method is developed to produce these solutions more efficiently. The approach is applied to a representative problem and the computational experience is presented.
