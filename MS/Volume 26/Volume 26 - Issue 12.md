## 1. Communications
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
Communications are read for interest in issues that have importance for all who practice and use management science. They are not refereed for technical correctness, as are articles and Notes that appear in Management Science. The reader is therefore cautioned that the publication of any Communication implies neither scientific standing nor acceptance per se on the part of either Management Science or TIMS.

## 2. Evaluating and Improving Resource Allocation for Navy Recruiting
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Morey
- John M. McCann
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
The recruitment of enlisted men and officers under the All-Volunteer Force concept costs approximately $620 million per year; of this amount approximately $100 million are in advertising expenditures. However, recently Congress and the General Accounting Office have expressed considerable concern over the lack of justification for such expenditures. The issue is further complicated by the recent recruiting shortfalls by all the services and the debate surrounding registration and a possible return to the draft. Finally, results of most profit-oriented sales research are difficult to apply to improving military recruiting efficiency due to the difference in the levels of rapport and credibility necessary to convince a potential recruit to invest several years of his life.

## 3. A New Specification of the Multichain Policy Iteration Algorithm in Undiscounted Markov Renewal Programs
### Author(s):
- A. Federgruen
- D. Spreen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
We consider the Policy Iteration Algorithm for undiscounted Markov Renewal Programs. Previous specifications of the policy evaluation part of this algorithm all required the analysis of the chain structure for each policy generated. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unique specification of the value vectors as well as an anticycling rule which avoids parsing the transition probability matrices into their subchains.

## 4. On Comparison of Cash Flow Streams
### Author(s):
- H. J. Landau
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
In problems where planning over time plays a role, natural objects for consideration are cash flow streams. In order to compare different policies we require some preference ordering over these streams. A customary approach to this problem is to assume that money can be borrowed and lent freely at some fixed interest ratei.e., that there exists a perfect capital marketand to compare streams with respect to such borrowing and lending. The induced ordering is based on the size of a single quantity, termed the discounted value, obtainable from the stream by a linear calculation.

## 5. Priority Update Intervals and Anomalies in Dynamic Ratio Type Job Shop Scheduling Rules
### Author(s):
- Nabil R. Adam
- Julius Surkis
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
Dynamic priority dispatching rules in job shops require the computation of all job priorities in a work center queue every time a machine in the work center becomes idle. This is extremely costly. Alternative priority update procedures are studied and comparative results in terms of performance measures and costs are reported. Ease of implementation of the various procedures in a real world job shop environment is discussed. A second problem related to an anomaly in ratio type dynamic priority rules is also studied; a simple modification to remove the anomaly is suggested and the performances of the old and modified procedures are compared.

## 6. Managerial Risk Preferences for Below-Target Returns
### Author(s):
- Dan J. Laughhunn
- John W. Payne
- Roy Crum
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
This paper reports on the risk preferences for below target returns of 224 managers from the U.S. Canada, and Europe. When only non-ruinous losses were involved, 71% of the managers were risk seeking for below target returns. The distribution of risk preferences tended to be stable over a wide range of experimental conditions: diversity of background of the managers, the size of outcomes below target, and the context of the decision process (personal versus managerial). When ruinous losses were introduced for 75 of the managers, 64% switched to risk averse behavior. Empirical findings concerning the relationship between risk preferences for below target returns and several demographic characteristics of managers are also reported.

## 7. Scheduling Jobs Subject to Nonhomogeneous Poisson Shocks
### Author(s):
- Michael L. Pinedo
- Sheldon M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
Consider n tasks which must be attempted in some order. To successfully complete any given task requires a random amount of time. However, we suppose that there are external events, called shocks, which occur according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. If no shocks occur while a task is being performed, then that task is considered a success. If a shock does occur, then work on that task ends and work on the next one begins. We consider such problems as maximizing
The expected number of successful tasks;
The length of time until no tasks remain;
The expected total reward earned; where a reward R1 is obtained upon successful completion of task i.

## 8. Optimal Multi-Level Lot Sizing for Requirements Planning Systems
### Author(s):
- Earle Steinberg
- H. Albert Napier
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
The wide spread use of advanced information systems such as Material Requirements Planning (MRP) has significantly altered the practice of dependent demand inventory management. Recent research has focused on development of multi-level lot sizing heuristics for such systems. In this paper, we develop an optimal procedure for the multi-period, multi-product, multi-level lot sizing problem by modeling the system as a constrained generalized network with fixed charge arcs and side constraints. The network permits us to relax some of the more restrictive assumptions of previous models such as those designed for product structures with single sources or successors.

## 9. NoteSensitivity Analysis in Leontief Substitution Systems
### Author(s):
- Gary J. Koehler
- Andrew B. Whinston
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
In this note we investigate extremal optimization over Leontief substitution systems. Such problems arise naturally in discounted Markov decision problems and in problems involving the control of economic systems. We develop both bounds on the objective value of a Leontief substitution system subject to perturbations and an algorithm for finding and improving perturbations.

## 10. NoteDisutility as a Probability: An Interpretation of Weighted Informational Measures
### Author(s):
- Henri Theil
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1980
### Abstract:
It is shown that the proposal for a utility-weighted informational measure discussed by Belis, and Guiasu (Belis, M., S. Guiasu. 1968. A quantitative-qualitative measure of information in cybernetic systems. IEEE Trans. Information Theory14 593594.) and others can be formulated in terms of classical (unweighted) information theory by interpreting utilities or disutilities as probabilities. Aggregation properties and extensions to prior and posterior probabilities are also discussed.
