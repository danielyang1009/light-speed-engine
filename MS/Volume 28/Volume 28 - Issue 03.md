### Abstract:
Public-sector planning problems are typically complex, and some important planning issues cannot be captured within a mathematical programming model of a problem; such issues may be qualitative in nature, unknown, or unrevealed by decisionmakers. Furthermore, there are often numerous solutions to a mathematical formulation that are nearly the same with respect to modeled issues but that are drastically different from each other in decision space. In such cases, some of these solutions may be significantly better than others with respect to unmodeled issues. Thus, a potentially important role of programming models is to generate a small number of alternative solutions that are feasible, perform well with respect to modeled issues, and are significantly different with respect to the decisions they specify. Such a set of alternatives may aid analysts and decision makers in understanding the problem and may serve as a catalyst for human creativity and invention.

## 2. Hidden Attributes and the Display of Information in Multiobjective Analysis

### Abstract:
Quite often in the creation of analytic models for decision problems involving multiple objectives, some of the objectives are excluded. This can be due to their being consciously or unconsciously hidden by the decisionmaker or due to the lack of quantifiable performance measures. The normal procedure for evaluation of alternatives by the decisionmaker involves the presentation of their performance with respect to the stated criteria. When there are hidden objectives, however, the impact of the policies cannot be fully evaluated. Without the values of performance measures for all objectives for each of the alternatives, the decision-maker's choice among them rests on his preference weightings of the modelled objectives alone. To facilitate the decisionmaker's evaluation with respect to the hidden attributes, the presentation of alternatives should include values of the decision variables as well as quantified criteria.

## 3. An Experimental Study of Performance Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Andrew D. Luzi

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
Performance information systems minimally consist of a performance standard, performance measurement, incentives to match performance to the standard, and periodic reports on performance. In this study four performance information systems are imposed on laboratory groups solving simple routine problems. These included speed, minimum messages, minimum error, and voting. There was a control condition with no explicit, performance information system. In aggregate, the groups tried to meet the assigned standard of performance. The performance information systems also set into motion other group processes resulting in numerous sensible but unanticipated consequences. It was not possible to conclude that the explicit performance information systems improved overall performance. The choice of performance information system did affect the task processes, the choice of structure, and the involvement in task supporting processes. The variability of behavior within each group suggests caution in widespread application of performance information systems.

## 4. Using Lagrangean Techniques to Solve Hierarchical Production Planning Problems
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
This paper proposes and tests a procedure for decomposing a large scale production planning problem modeled as a mixed-integer linear program. We interpret this decomposition in the context of Hax and Meal's hierarchical framework for production planning. The procedure decomposes the production planning problem into two subproblems which correspond to the aggregate planning subproblem and a disaggregation subproblem in the Hax-Meal framework. The linking mechanism for these two subproblems is an inventory consistency relationship which is priced out by a set of Lagrange multipliers. The best values for the multipliers are found by an iterative procedure which may be interpreted as a feedback mechanism in the Hax-Meal framework. At each iteration, the procedure finds both a lower bound on the optimal value to the production planning problem and a feasible solution from which an upper bound is obtained. Our computational tests show that the best feasible solution found from this procedure is very close to optimal. For thirty-six test problems the percentage deviation from optimality never exceeds 4.4%, and the average percentage deviation is 2.2%. In addition, these best feasible solutions dominate the corresponding solutions obtained by a hierarchical procedure.

## 5. Decision Analysis of Program Choices in Magnetic Fusion Energy Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
This paper describes a methodology based on decision analysis for addressing major program decisions in the development of magnetic fusion energy. The development of this complex technology involves a sequence of funding choices over time among multiple technical approaches and under considerable performance uncertainty. The methodology focuses on the next major facility decision in the U.S magnetic fusion energy program. The decision alternatives include the construction and testing of a major experimental facility based on one of two leading technical approaches (reactor designs), an accelerated program where both approaches are pursued, or delaying another facility until more information is available. Subsequent decisions depend on the first decision and its outcome and involve either further development of the best technical approach or abandonment of the entire research and development program. Analysis of a particular sequence of program decisions takes account of the uncertainties in the ultimate economic performance (cents per kilowatt-hour) of the resulting commercial reactor, the time of commercial availability, and market penetration. Reactor performance is analyzed at a component level and explicitly considers the dependence of component performances based on one technical approach on the respective component performances of alternative approaches. The net benefits of magnetic fusion R&D are assessed by computing the discounted expected cost savings attributable to commercial magnetic fusion energy minus the discounted costs of the R&D program.

## 6. A Systematic Approach to Nuclear Safeguards Decision-Making
### Author(s):

- Stein Weissenberger
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
The regulatory decision on how safe a safeguarded nuclear facility should be depends on a trade-off between diversion risk and the cost of reducing that risk. Given that one plans to build the plant, the optimum level of safeguards is achieved when the cost of further risk reduction exceeds the benefit from lower risk. This paper develops quantitative models of factors that influence this risk/cost trade-off. A basic conceptual structure is presented, and a detailed example is used to illustrate the methodology for optimal regulation setting.

## 7. A Simple Algorithm for Optimal Portfolio Selection with Fixed Transaction Costs
### Author(s):
- Nitin R. Patel
- Marti G. Subrahmanyam
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
The general optimal portfolio selection problem with fixed transaction costs is a complex mathematical programming problem. However, by placing reasonable restrictions on the variance-covariance matrix of returns, it is possible to simplify the solution of the problem. Specifically if the structure of returns between securities is such that the pairwise correlation coefficients are approximately the same, a fairly simple algorithm which requires little computational effort can be employed. This method can also be extended to the case where changes in the information set necessitate a revision of an existing portfolio.

## 8. Leadership: Perspectives in Theory and Research
### Author(s):
- Arthur G. Jago
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1982
### Abstract:
Prominent trends in leadership research are reviewed. Theoretical perspectives are organized in a four-fold typology based on the dominating assumptions of the research effort: (1) the focus on a universally appropriate set of leadership traits, (2) the focus on a universally appropriate behavioral style, (3) the focus on situationally contingent leadership traits, and (4) the focus on situationally contingent behavioral styles. Potential organizational prescriptions following from each perspective are identified (e.g., selection, placement, training). It is argued that existing research has mapped only a portion of the domain of leadership phenomena due to a concentration on relatively few leadership constructs and because of the popularity of a limited set of empirical methodologies. Recent developments, promising new directions, and novel methods in leadership research are described.
