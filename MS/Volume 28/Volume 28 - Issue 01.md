## 1. State of the ArtA Survey of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes: Theory, Models, and Algorithms
### Author(s):
- George E. Monahan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
This paper surveys models and algorithms dealing with partially observable Markov decision processes. A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a generalization of a Markov decision process which permits uncertainty regarding the state of a Markov process and allows for state information acquisition. A general framework for finite state and action POMDP's is presented. Next, there is a brief discussion of the development of POMDP's and their relationship with other decision processes. A wide range of models in such areas as quality control, machine maintenance, internal auditing, learning, and optimal stopping are discussed within the POMDP-framework. Lastly, algorithms for computing optimal solutions to POMDP's are presented.

## 2. An Experimental Study of the Impact of Judgment-Based Marketing Models
### Author(s):
- Shelby H. McIntyre
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
The impact of a decision calculus model on decision quality is assessed in a laboratory setting. An experimental design assesses the effects of: (a) the size of the problem (i.e., the number of control units over which allocations are to be made), (b) the noise-to-signal ratio in the market and (c) individual differences among the model users. The aspects of individual differences studied are: (1) time taken on the task, (2) mathematical ability and (3) cognitive style. The main experiment involved 96 subjects in a full factorial design. In general, the decision calculus model had a beneficial impact on a broad range of decision quality measures, particularly profit achievement.

## 3. The Multiple-Choice Nested Knapsack Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
A specially-structured integer programming model, called the multiple-choice nested knapsack model, is developed in this paper. The model is characterized by variables which are partitioned into multiple-choice sets and resource constraints which are nested across the multiple-choice sets. The application of the model in the areas of merchandise catalog planning and sales resource allocation is described. An algorithm for the model is presented and the results of the computational testing of the algorithm are provided.

## 4. Improved Heuristics for Multi-Stage Requirements Planning Systems
### Author(s):
- Joseph D. Blackburn
- Robert A. Millen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
Most of the recent studies of heuristic lot-sizing techniques for multi-stage material requirements planning systems have investigated the problem in the context of a single stage. In this paper, the multi-stage problem is first modeled analytically to indicate the potential errors inherent in the commonly proposed single-pass, stage-by-stage approaches (e.g., Wagner-Whitin). Then, based on this analysis, several simple cost modifications are suggested to improve the global optimality of these procedures. The effectiveness of these alternative modifications is tested through a series of simulation experiments. It is concluded that some of these modifications consistently improve the performance of the stage-by-stage approaches.

## 5. Performance of a Regulatory Agency as a Function of its Structure and Client Environment: A Simulation Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
This paper examines some of the interrelationships between the formal organization of a regulatory agency and its task environment. Central to the analysis is the development of a simulation model of a regulatory agency. The model depicts the agency as an hierarchical assemblage of decision units whose overall goal is to satisfy clients without antagonizing competitive interests. The model of the agency incorporates the formal structure of authority, the communication network and the process of exchange of informal obligations between agency decision units. The agency's task environment is composed of clients, each of whom communicates his problems to be solved to a different decision unit. As we posit a number of competitive and complementary relationships between clients, the resolution of a problem for one client will impose positive and negative externalities on other clients. While the goals of different decision units may come into conflict, decision units in the model cannot act independently; a coalition is required to resolve a problem.

## 6. User Involvement in Information System Development: A Conflict Model and Empirical Test
### Author(s):
- Daniel Robey
- Dana Farrow
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
This research explores the relationships among user participation, influence, conflict, and conflict resolution in the development of management information systems. Three stages of development are analyzed: initiation, design, and implementation. Results show that influence does result from user participation, and that influence leads to both conflict and resolution. Participation without influence, however, does not lead to successful conflict resolution in any of the three development stages.

## 7. Network Models for Building Evacuation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
How can a large building with many occupants be evacuated in minimum time, and where are bottlenecks likely to occur in such an evacuation? In order to address this question we have constructed a family of three network building evacuation models. The most general model of interest, called the dynamic model, represents the evacuation of a building as it evolves over time, where time is represented discretely by consecutive time periods. The dynamic model triply optimizes in the sense that while directly minimizing the average over the occupants of the number of periods each needs to exit the building, it simultaneously maximizes the total number of people evacuating the building during periods 1 through p for all values of p, and also minimizes the time period in which the last evacuee exits the building. Coincident with the triple optimization, each arc dual variable indicates whether or not the building component the arc represents is a bottleneck in any period during the evacuation.

## 8. NoteSome Equivalent Objectives for Dynamic Network Flow Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1982
### Abstract:
Many important problems can be modeled as dynamic (time-expanded) network flow problems. For example, in building evacuation we might use twenty nodes to represent a room at 3 minute intervals over an hour, and use arcs to indicate the feasible passages, over time, among the various rooms. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate that it is possible to satisfy at least three important objectives simultaneously in a maximal dynamic network flow problem. These are (1) construction of an earliest arrival schedule (i.e., a solution which maximizes flow in the first p periods, for every p), (2) minimization of the period at which the last unit of flow arrives at the sink, and (3) minimization of the average time for all flow to arrive at the sink.
