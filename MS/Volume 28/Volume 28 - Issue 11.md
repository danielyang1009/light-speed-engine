### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
Improved priority scheduling rules are presented for a repair shop supporting a multi-item repairable inventory system with a hierarchical product structure. A variety of scheduling rules are evaluated using a simulation of a representative shop and product structure. The results indicate that dynamic rules which use inventory status information perform better than other dynamic or static rules which ignore inventory status; moreover, dynamic rules which use work-in-process inventory information outperform dynamic rules which ignore work-in-process inventory levels. In the simulation, the use of improved scheduling rules provides performance equivalent to a 20% reduction in spares inventory.

## 2. Some Comments on the Development and Application of Linear Learning Models
### Author(s):
- Peter S. H. Leeflang

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
This paper evaluates some learning models and explores the possibility of extending the linear learning models by adding explanatory variables, using Lilien's model as a point of departure. Two parameter estimation schemes are proposed and applied: one at the micro-level using consumer panel data (micro-data) and the other at the macro-level using aggregate time-series data (macro-data). The use of micro-data restrains the estimation of effects to a limited number of decision variables in Lilien's model, because of a lack of degrees of freedom. It is shown that by modifying the equations of Lilien's model and by considering more than two brands the number of degrees of freedom can be increased considerably. This opens the possibility of estimating the response parameters of many more explanatory variables, in theory. However, practically speaking, estimation remains difficult because the parameters in the modified model are heavily restricted by standard probabilistic and other constraints. The endeavor to estimate the parameters of the modified linear learning model using macro-data is not feasible. This leads to the conclusion that the application of learning models in the area of decision-making in marketing is rather difficult and limited.

## 3. A Mathematical Model for an Energy Forest
### Author(s):
- Olavi Hellman
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
A mathematical model for a forest consisting of a single species of trees with a steady state distribution of age is suggested. The forest is self-sustained in the sense that trees put out seeds from which new trees will grow. Therefore, there will be trees of different year classes. The rules for tree cutting are obtained to maximize the physical yield from the forest. The rule of cutting is given by function u() of the age  of the tree which tells which fraction of all trees of age  of the forest must be felled during unit time. Function u() is obtained by using a slightly generalized optimal control theory which reduces the problem to a fairly simple nonlinear programming problem. The cost of harvesting may be included in the objective functional. All biological characteristics of a forest are contained in two functions of the age of a tree. These functions would be obtained through a process of identification. The model is intended to be a part of a large forest-economy system, therefore mathematical simplicity has been a goal.

## 4. Planning the Balance of Health and Social Services in the United Kingdom
### Author(s):

- Geoff Royston
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
Within the context of the U.K. background (public expenditure is being severely curtailed, at a local level health services and social services are controlled by separate organisations and there are many groups of the population for whom a number of acceptable treatments, or methods of caring, exist), the paper describes the development of a resource allocation model and its use in a local planning situation. Although based on the techniques of mathematical programming, the model does not purport to indicate a single optimum allocation of health and social services resources, but rather to calculate the resource consequences of possible alternative courses of action. As such, its use is seen as iterative, in that health and social services decision makers can review and update their assumptions in the light of the results from successive runs of model.

## 5. Parametric Mixed Integer Programming: An Application to Solid Waste Management
### Author(s):
- Larry Jenkins
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
A method is developed for carrying out parametric analysis on a mixed integer linear program (MILP) as either objective function coefficients or right-hand-side values of the constraints are varied continuously. The method involves solving MILPs at point values of the parameters of variation and joining the results by LP parametric analysis.

## 8. On Optimal Replacement Policies
### Author(s):
- D. Assaf
- B. Levikson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
A system (e.g., a car) must operate for the next t time units. A certain component (e.g., a battery) must be replaced whenever it fails, as it is essential for the operation of the system. There are several types of components differing only in price and life distribution. The problem of choosing the optimal type at any time in which a replacement is needed has previously been studied when all life distributions are exponential. In this paper the results are extended to the case where life distrubutions are arbitrary. Conditions are given under which there is an optimal replacement policy with a special convenient form. Algorithms for the solution of the problem are provided. Examples and related problems are discussed.

## 9. Optimal and Near Optimal Price and Advertising Strategies for Finite and Infinite Horizons
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
The simplest price and advertising optimization model consistent with current empirical research is formulated and analyzed. An explicit horizon function is introduced to compare and synthesize the finite and infinite horizon situations. The practically prevalent procedure of setting this period's advertising expenditure proportional to the previous period's sales is, for good reasons, declared near optimal.

## 10. Optimizing Field Repair Kits Based on Job Completion Rate
### Author(s):
- John W. Mamer
- Stephen A. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
A formulation is presented for obtaining the optimal kit of parts and tools for on-site equipment repairs, based on the fraction of jobs which can be completed from the contents of the kit. This formulation generalizes previous approaches in that part demands need not be independent and various numbers of parts as well as multiple part types per job may be required. It is shown that the formulation is a special case of Balinski's selection problem and thus can be solved by maximal flow/minimal cut network algorithms.

## 11. NoteA Multiple-Item Inventory Model with a Job Completion Criterion
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
Most office equipment is maintained by service organizations consisting of teams of service representatives. An important problem for the service organizations is the determination of the spare parts inventory to be carried by each service representative. This note presents a model for finding the spare parts kit that has the minimum inventory investment for a specified job completion criterion. The model is shown to be equivalent to a binary knapsack problem. The model is contrasted with the model developed by Smith, Chambers and Shlifer for a similar problem.

## 12. NoteOn Anomalies in Dynamic Ratio Type Scheduling Rules: A Clarifying Analysis
### Author(s):
- John J. Kanet
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
Previous authors have shown that dynamic ratio scheduling rules do not always behave as intended. A recent proposal by Adam and Surkis (Adam, N. R., J. Surkis. 1980. Priority update intervals and anomalies in dynamic ratio type job shop scheduling rules. Management Sci.26 (12, December) 12271237.) to correct such anomalies is shown to be in error. The reason why such anomalies occur is clarified and a rule which prevents such anomalies is presented.

## 13. NoteOn the Optimality of Integer Lot Size Ratios in Economic Lot Size Determination in Multi-Stage Assembly Systems
### Author(s):
- Jack F. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1982
### Abstract:
The proof of a well known theorem by Crowston and Wagner in Crowston, Wagner, and Williams (Crowston, W. B., M. H. Wagner, J. F., Williams. 1973. Economic lot size determination in multi-stage assembly systems. Management Sci.19 (5, January) 517527.) is shown here to be defective. According to this theorem, an optimal solution to the batch size determination problem for multi-echelon production/inventory assembly structures is characterized by a set of lot sizes, such that the lot size at each stage must be an integer multiple of the lot size at its successor stage. The theorem has been said to apply to uncapacitated assembly systems having constant final product demand over an infinite horizon, with no backlogs or lost sales permitted, where lot sizes must be rational numbers and time invariant. While the theorem supposedly applied to the case of both finite production rates and infinite production rates, the proof dealt only with the case of instantaneous production. Also, the proof implicitly assumed that lots were processed at any given stage only after unchanging spans of time. In this paper we show that with or without this implicit assumption, the theorem does hold true for the special case of instantaneous processing in two-level assembly systems; that is, configurations where there is only one successor stage in the entire system. However, we also show by counterexample that without this implicit assumption, the theorem is invalid for more general assembly structures. Furthermore, in the appendix of this paper we show that the proof is defective at the point where Crowston and Wagner extend their results for two-level systems to more general assembly systems. Thus it is an open question whether or not the theorem is valid for all assembly structures when processing at any given stage must occur only after unchanging spans of time.
