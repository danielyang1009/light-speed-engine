### Abstract:
Distributed processing has been motivated by many objectives. Among these are a desire to share resources, reduce communications costs (as compared to a centralized processing scheme), increase performance and decrease response time by partitioning tasks and achieve higher system availability (fault tolerance). Typically, processes (tasks) within a single processor and across processors will communicate among themselves in such a distributed environment. It is desirable to be able to assign tasks to processors in some optimal manner. In this paper, a quadratic partitioning model is developed to represent this interaction of tasks in a distributed processing environment. Initially, no capacity constraints are considered at any processor. An optimal solution (in a probabilistic sense) is found for this uncapacitated problem using a probabilistic branch and bound technique. Capacity constraints for processors are then introduced. Three intuitively appealing heuristics are developed to obtain good, though not necessarily optimal, solutions to the capacitated problem.

## 2. Size and Administrative Intensity in Organizational Divisions

- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the relationship between the size of an organization and the number of its administrative personnel drawing upon information from 46 local electricity distribution divisions. Traditionally size has been treated as a uni-dimensional concept, and various single measures/indicators have been used to represent it. In contrast to this view the present study considers size as multi-dimensional. An array of indicators is used and factor analysis is employed to uncover underlying distinct dimensions. In a further step the relationship between the administrative component, i.e., the number of administrative personnel, and the revealed distinct dimensions of size is examined. Results show that the administrative component increases less than proportionately with output-related dimensions of size, thus suggesting that here there are economies of scale. On the other hand the administrative component appears to be weakly related or unrelated to other dimensions expressing fixed assets, market characteristics and growth. Theoretical and practical implications of the analysis are discussed.

## 3. The Shapley Value as Aircraft Landing FeesRevisited
### Author(s):
- Pradeep Dubey
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
We examine the axiomatic basis of the Shapley value when applied to the problem of allocating the cost of a runway among different-sized users. Our approach is to begin with a model of airport-problems and then to listwithin the modelcertain natural properties which an allocation ought to satisfy. It is shown that these lead uniquely to the Shapley value.

## 4. Relative Risk Aversion
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer
- Rakesh K. Sarin
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
An individual's preference for risky alternatives is influenced by the strength of preference he feels for the consequences and his attitude toward risk taking. Conventional measures of risk attitude confound these two factors. In this paper we formally separate these factors and explore how this separation might significantly enhance our understanding of decision making under risk.

## 5. On the Reswitching Property of R&D
### Author(s):
- Tom K. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
Existing theoretical models of research and development (R&D) treat R&D as a single economic activity. Once R&D terminates, the only way for the activity to resume is by assuming some exogenous changes in the basic parameters of the model, e.g., the distribution of technological advances. In contrast, this paper treats R&D as two unique but dependent economic activities.

## 6. A Nonsequential R & D Search Model
### Author(s):
- Tom K. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
Managers of research and development (R&D) programs are often confronted with questions of what determines R&D spending (i.e. R&D search intensity) and when R&D spending is unprofitable (i.e. Reservation Technology Level). Three determinants of R&D spending are identified: the current technology level, the length of decision horizon, and basic research. Comparative statics of the effects of these determinants of R&D spending are discussed.

## 7. A Method for the Prescriptive Assessment of the Flow of Information Within Organizations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
Research on information flow in organizational networks has focused on structural aspects and the identification and location of special communicators or gatekeepers. In this paper, the methods of system reliability are adapted to the systematic analysis of information flow networks; in this context, system reliability is the probability of information flow between the information source and the ultimate recipient, while arc reliability is the probability of information flow on that arc. Gatekeepers generally differ from other nodes in the network by virtue of their greater number of and more reliable incoming and outgoing arcs. Through methods illustrated here, gatekeepers, as well as other nodes and their connecting arcs, can be assessed with respect to their contribution to system effectiveness (reliability). With this analytical capability, the manager can explore and assess alternate courses of action in order to adopt those which most enhance system effectiveness. The approach is illustrated by application to two representative studies from the literature on information flow in R&D organizations.

## 8. Algorithmic Solution of Some Queues with Overflows
### Author(s):
- Marcel F. Neuts

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
The overflow stream from an M/PH/1 queue of finite capacity is used as the input to an unbounded queue with one or more exponential servers. It is shown that the combined system, consisting of the two queues, may be studied as a highly structured Markov process. In the stable case, this Markov process has a matrix-geometric invariant vector. Particular features of the infinitesimal generator of the process may be used to simplify the numerical computation of various steady-state features of the model. Several variants and numerical examples are discussed.

## 9. Sources of Bias in Assessment Procedures for Utility Functions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1982
### Abstract:
Utility functions are an important component of normative decision analysis, in that they characterize the nature of people's risk-taking attitudes. In this paper we examine various factors that make it difficult to speak of the utility function for a given person. Similarly we show that it is questionable to pool risk-propensity data across studies (for descriptive purposes) that differ in the elicitation methods employed.
