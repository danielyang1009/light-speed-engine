## 1. Theory, Models and Implementation in Financial Management
### Author(s):
- J. Morris McInnes

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
A theory of corporate financial management is summarized from the broad flow of finance literature. Within this, contributions to a normative theory, amenable to corporate financial modeling, are reviewed in some detail. The central propositions of a normative theory are isolated to provide a basis of comparison for the practice of financial modeling, as observed through a field research study. Differences between theory and practice are identified and discussed.

## 2. Stratport: A Model for the Evaluation and Formulation of Business Portfolio Strategies
### Author(s):
- Jean-Claude Larrch

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
A decision support system to evaluate and formulate business portfolio strategies is proposed. Strategies are expressed in terms of market share objectives to be achieved in each of the N business units in the portfolio. STRATPORT evaluates a strategy in terms of the net present value of its after-tax cash flows in the long term as well as its short-term net cash flow implications. Risk considerations are incorporated as per the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The model explicitly considers marketing investment, capacity expenditures, working capital and the impact of experience on costs and revenues over a time horizon. The formulation of strategy is accomplished by maximizing long-term profit subject to a short-term net cash flow limit, with the maximization repeated over a range of values for the short-term net cash flow limit. The use of the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier permits the simultaneous optimization of N market shares to be accomplished more efficiently by N univariate maximizations. Although the function that is maximized in the univariate maximization is not unimodal, the newly proposed procedure guarantees that a global maximum will be found. Limitations of the model and some extensions to minimize their impact are discussed.

## 3. Exact and Approximate Cost Functions for Product Aggregates
### Author(s):
- Paul Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
We show that certain large, multiproduct problems can be well approximated by smaller models of the same form, representing only one aggregate product (or a few such products). This reduction follows from a new technique to approximate the minimal cost of a special allocation or disaggregation problem, by a simple, closed-form aggregate cost function. This function, moreover, has the same form as the cost functions for the original, individual products. For special cases the approximation is exact. (This latter result is related to economic-theoretic research on aggregation with homothetic preferences.) The results are applied to a one-stage, multiperiod, multi-item production smoothing model, and then to a similar model of a two-stage system, yielding a reduction in the number of items to one or to relatively few.

## 4. The Longitudinal Analysis of Organizations: A Methodological Perspective
### Author(s):
- Danny Miller
- Peter H. Friesen
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
The case is made for performing more longitudinal research into organizations and their adaptive processes. Previous literature on the empirical longitudinal analysts of organizations is classified into five categories on the basis of the breadth of scope of the research, the number and diversity of organizations being studied, and the degree to which mathematical and statistical procedures are used to develop conclusions. The strengths and limitations of each of the five types of longitudinal research are discussed. It is argued that there should be a more concerted attempt to undertake research that focuses on a broad array of organizational variables in many organizations and which uses quantitative methods to derive results which are replicable and whose range of generality has been carefully established. Several proposals are made toward this end. Methods are suggested for gathering valid and reliable longitudinal multivariate data from numerous organizations in an economical fashion. Also, techniques of statistical and mathematical analysis are proposed for handling the complications caused by multivariate nonlinearities in longitudinal data. Of particular interest in this regard is the use of techniques of organizational taxonomy generation and testing and the use of algebraic heuristic procedures for identifying and differentiating among common scenarios of change in organizations. These suggestions should help to combat the non-cumulative nature of longitudinal research by avoiding the very common problems of specification error, nongenerality, and non-replicability.

## 5. Forecasting Applications of an Adaptive Multiple Exponential Smoothing Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a class of multiple exponential smoothing models useful in automated or minimal intervention industrial forecasting systems. These models are an alternative to simple univariate exponential smoothing and Trigg and Leach type adaptive models, which treat time series as unrelated and so cannot explicitly accommodate interrelationships that may exist between two or more time series. Moreover, the multiple models are adaptive in that the smoothing matrix, which is a generalization of the smoothing constant of univariate models, changes from period to period. Maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters, including the full variance-covariance structure as well as the smoothing matrix, are provided, thus freeing the model user from the need for making ad hoc estimates of parameter values, a feature of simple univariate exponential smoothing. The forecast performance of this multiple time series model is compared with that of other univariate models using automobile sales data and some promising results are obtained.

## 6. A Mixed Exponential Time Series Model
### Author(s):
- A. J. Lawrance
- P. A. W. Lewis
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
The simple model NMEAR (1) is described for a stationary dependent sequence of random variables which have a mixed exponential marginal distribution; the model is a first-order stochastic difference equation with random coefficients and is first-order Markovian. It should be broadly applicable for stochastic modelling in operations analysis. In particular, it provides a model for simulating interarrival times in queuing systems when these random variables are overdispersed relative to an exponential random variable, and moreover are positively correlated. The model also has capability to model a variable which may be zero, but which otherwise is exponentially distributed. Such variables are found as waiting times in queuing models. Because of the (random) linearity of the process, it is easily extended to the modelling of cross-coupled sequences of interarrival and service times. The model can also be extended quite simply to a mixed exponential process with mixed pth order autoregressive and qth order moving average correlation structure, NMEAR (p, q), so that non-Markovian dependence can be handled.

## 7. A Stochastic Model of Consumer Behavior and Optimal Advertising
### Author(s):
- Charles S. Tapiero
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
A stochastic consumer behavior model is constructed transforming Nicosia's (Nicosia, F. M., 1966. Consumer Decision Processes. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.) postulates into probability hypotheses. Nicosia's deterministic model is obtained in the mean evolutions and variance-covariances, defined by a system of linear differential equations obtained. This system, forming together with mean evolutions a closed system of five simultaneous differential equations is studied for stability, to devise optimal communication strategies and for suggesting an estimation technique.

## 8. On the Ample Service Assumption of Palm's Theorem in Inventory Modeling
### Author(s):
- Donald Gross
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
A key assumption of much of the continuous review inventory modeling work is that orders placed do not queue up, so that there is complete order crossing and hence order lead times are strictly independent random variables. This paper investigates the effects of this assumption (which is almost never true).

## 9. Multicommodity Network Flows with Probabilistic Losses
### Author(s):
- Y. P. Aneja
- K. P. K. Nair
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1982
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of maximizing the expected value of multicommodity flows in a network in which the arcs experience probabilistic loss rates. Consideration of probabilistic losses are relevant, particularly, in communication and transportation networks. An arc-chain formulation of the problem and an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal solution are provided. The algorithm involves a modified column generation technique for identifying a constrained chain. Computational experience with the algorithm is included.
