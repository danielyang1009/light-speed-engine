## 1. Predicting Demand for Residential Solar Heating: An Attribute Method
### Author(s):
- M. K. Berkowitz
- G. H. Haines
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
This paper presents two models which allow long run demand for a new product to be estimated prior to any significant sales history. The specific product studied is residential solar heating in Canada. Both models are based on the concept that consumers react in their purchasing decisions to the inherent package of characteristics in a commodity. The use of survey information to enable specific numerical estimates to be made is exemplified. Directions for future research to improve the usefulness of such models are suggested.

## 2. An Empirical Bayes Estimate of Market Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
Starting with a market model of security returns, we describe how the parameters of a distribution for security characteristics can be estimated in a manner correcting for a subtle but significant source of error. When this error is removed, strong negative correlations between alpha and beta and between alpha and sigma squared, and a strong positive correlation between beta and sigma squared are observed. With this feature in the prior distribution, and with the results of a regression for a particular security, we develop an empirical Bayes estimate of the security's three parameters (alpha, beta and sigma squared) which makes use of more information than other estimates described in the literature.

## 3. The Bond Scheduling Problem of the Multi-Subsidiary Holding Company
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
- James H. Vander Weide
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
This paper presents a decision-theoretic model of the bond scheduling problem faced by a multi-subsidiary holding company such as AT&T or GTE. The objective is to minimize the total cost of bond flotations across all subsidiaries, where total cost is the sum of the yield paid to investors, the flotation expense associated with the preparation of each issue and the opportunity expense to each subsidiary of not meeting its request at the desired time. Our model suggests that the timing of bond issues is primarily a problem in trading off the diseconomies of issuing many bonds in one month with the penalty costs of delay. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm for solving the problem is also presented along with an example.

## 4. A Four-Moments Alternative to Simulation for a Class of Stochastic Management Models
### Author(s):
- John F. Kottas
- Hon-Shiang Lau
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
This paper presents a computational alternative to simulation for a large class of stochastic management models involving functions of random variables. An example of a model in this class is the well-known risk analysis problem studied by Hertz and Hillier. Our computational approach includes (i) a versatile framework to describe the univariate and dependence characteristics of a model's random variables, and (ii) formulas for computing the central moments of the model's objective variable. The usefulness of these central moments in decision making is then illustrated and discussed.

## 5. Police Patrol-Initiated Activities Within a Systems Queueing Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
Officers in police patrol cars operate in a complex stochastic environment. In addition to handling dispatcher-assigned calls for service from the public, they patrol to pose a threat of apprehension to would-be offenders and undertake certain on-site interventions to help improve general public safety. The on-site work, often highly discretionary, is called patrol-initiated activity. It includes issuing tickets for traffic violations, building checks, car checks, pedestrian checks and assisting motorists. In many cities patrol-initiated activities and calls for service consume comparable amounts of officers' time. In this paper we develop a spatially-oriented queueing-type model of a police patrol force that allows each of N patrol cars to be in one of three states: (1) busy, on a call for service; (2) busy, on a patrol-initiated activity; (3) free, on patrol. Designed for computer solution, the model yields N nonlinear equations whose unknowns are the workloads of the N patrol cars. Other performance measures of patrol can be computed easily in terms of the workloads. The incorporation of patrol-initiated activities represents an improvement over previous OR/MS models, and could result in more informed police management decisions regarding patrol beat design, workload smoothing among officers, and reduction of neighborhood-specific inequities in police accessibility. The methods of this paper are potentially applicable to other urban services, including taxi and maintenance operations.

## 6. The Hierarchical Service Location Problem
### Author(s):
- George C. Moore
- Charles ReVelle
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
A location problem with a hierarchy of facilities and services is proposed and solved. The formulation defines a demand point to be covered for a given level of service if some member of the facility hierarchy eligible to provide that service is present within an appropriate distance. Furthermore, the absence of coverage at any one service level for a demand point is taken to imply lack of coverage in the grand measure of coverage. The problem's objective is the maximum coverage of population given specific limits on either the number of each type of facility or on the total investment that can be made in all facility types. Relaxed linear programming, supplemented by branch and bound where necessary, is used to solve the resulting integer programming problem. An application is described that uses distance and population data developed for a region of Honduras. Honduran nationals are currently being trained in the use of this and related location methodologies under a contract with the Agency for International Development. This effort is in support of work being undertaken by the Honduran National Planning Council to develop a nationwide data set of populated places in Honduras to which location methodologies will be applied.

## 7. Modeling the Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypertension
### Author(s):
- Lemuel A. Moy
- Stephen D. Roberts
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
We have developed a stochastic representation of the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension that is useful in predicting the outcome of various therapy protocols (sequences of antihypertension agents). Important variables (compliance, pharmacologic potency, incidence of side effects, symptoms from hypertension, and financial cost) are incorporated in the model, realistically representing the complex interactions involved in the treatment of hypertension from the perspectives of both physicians and patients. The outcome measures of the model are clinically relevant and easily interpreted. The model's predictions were found to conform with data from an empirical study. This treatment model was also used to compare commonly utilized antihypertensive agents within the traditional stepped care approach currently popular among clinicians.

## 8. The Two-Product, Single-Machine, Static Demand, Infinite Horizon Lot Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Fayez Fouad Boctor
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
In this paper, we deal with the two-product, single-machine, static demand, infinite horizon lot scheduling problem. After a quick review of the literature, the necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility are derived without imposing any preliminary requirements. Then, an optimal solution algorithm is presented. Finally, we show that a necessary condition for the feasibility of N-product schedules is that each cycle time be an integer multiple of some basic cycle time.

## 9. A General Class of Holt-Winters Type Forecasting Models
### Author(s):
- S. A. Roberts
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the formulation of short-term forecasting models, and introduces a range of models of considerable importance. These are defined in terms of predictions and sensible updating mechanisms for estimates of quantities such as level, growth, and seasonality, and constitute generalizations of familiar (linear) exponential smoothing predictors. They are shown to be equivalent to particular ARIMA models, and generally these do not lie within that subset of the ARIMA class which forms the basis of the Box-Jenkins modelling approach. It is argued that the models of this paper have a reasoned structure, and are to be preferred to the Box-Jenkins models for most socio-economic applications.

## 10. Some New Results for the M/M/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- Claude Dennis Pegden
- Matthew Rosenshine
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1982
### Abstract:
New results are obtained for the single server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. A closed form solution involving only finite sums is obtained for the probability that exactly i arrivals and j services occur over a time interval of length t in a queueing system that is idle at the beginning of the interval. Since many applications of queueing theory involve queues which are emptied and restarted periodically and thus not susceptible to analysis using the well-known equilibrium results, there are many potential applications for results obtained. Some ways in which the results obtained may be applied are discussed.
