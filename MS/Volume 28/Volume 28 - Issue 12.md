### Abstract:
A school may be viewed as an enterprise in which the professional staff provide the operating conditions for converting quantifiable resources or inputs into pupil learning (outputs). The resources are determined by budgets, teacher assignments, and student assignments while learning is determined by various outputs scored according to standardized tests such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Following the work of Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper, E. Rhodes. 1981. Evaluating program and managerial efficiency: an application of data envelopment analysis to program follow through. Management Sci.27 (6) 668697.), we use a ratio definition of efficiency that takes account of all outputs and inputs without requiring a priori specification of weights. Instead a series of mathematical programs are applied to determine virtual multipliers from actual data. The multipliers produce values that can be regarded as the most favorable weights for each school being evaluated. If the resulting optimum virtual multipliers for a given school yield an efficiency ratio of one, then that school is said to be efficient. If the ratio is less than one then that school is said to be inefficient relative to the other schools in the analysis. The ratio is also accorded operational significanceit is not merely an index numberso that the resulting values and the associated virtual multipliers make it possible to locate where improvements may be made along with their relative magnitudes.

### Abstract:
The calculation of margin for investor's option accounts is a complex and costly problem for brokerage houses. The existing procedures usually involve a heuristic requiring sequential computations. These are shown to be inefficient and suboptimal. A simple transportation formulation is presented which permits a direct computation of minimum margin and shows considerable savings when compared with existing heuristic procedures.

## 3. Geographic Decomposition of the Shortest Path Problem, with an Application to the Traffic Assignment Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
An algorithm, which can be applied to loosely connected networks, is given for geographically decomposing the shortest path problem. The algorithm is applicable to the traffic assignment problem when it is solved as a series of shortest path problems by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Numerical results for a large 1287 node, 3752 arc traffic assignment problem for Washington, D.C., indicate that using geographical decomposition can reduce computer memory storage requirements or program run time.

- Vincent P. Barabba
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new framework for handling ill-structured decision problems. The framework derives from recent developments in the logic of argumentation. It shows how policy statements may under certain conditions be construed as the outcome of a complex process of argumentation.

## 5. Integrating New Technical Staff: Implications for Acquiring New Technology
### Author(s):

- Thomas J. Allen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
Hiring new staff in R&D provides an important opportunity for a firm to acquire new technological knowledge. It also takes a considerable length of time before new R&D staff become fully integrated into the organization. This study compares the communication patterns of new and veteran R&D staff as a function of their work activities. The results suggest that both the benefits and problems in the hiring and integration of new R&D staff is moderated by the type of research, development or technical service work involved. Particular attention should be paid to the integration of new staff involved in new product or process development, where the benefits of bringing in new people are great, but the communication barriers to overcome are also found to be the most serious.

## 6. Diffusion of Modern Software Practices: Influence of Centralization and Formalization
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Zmud
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
Centralization and formalization have previously been employed in research designs investigating organizational innovation. The results, however, have been mixed. Three arguments are raised toward explaining this inconsistency. First, innovation is a multi-phased process in which the influence of centralization and formalization could be expected to differ. Second, as innovations may vary with regard to their compatibility to individuals in organizations, the expected influence of centralization and formalization may also vary. Third, organizational innovations may be directed toward particular vested interests, such as the technical or administrative core. Accordingly, the influence of centralization and formalization may also vary.

## 7. Does Divisional Play Lead to More Pennant Races?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
A pennant race occurs in a sports league if the top two teams in a league finish within m games of each other. We develop an analytical model that can be used to predict the probability that a sports league will have a pennant race. The model is then tested on data from the last 50 major league baseball seasons and is shown to do a remarkable job of predicting the number of pennant races that actually occurred. Finally, we give conditions which ensure that dividing a league of 2n teams into 2n-team divisions will increase the expected number of pennant races. As a corollary to this result we prove that the divisional structure which maximizes the expected number of pennant races must contain no divisions with 4 or more teams.

## 8. Multiperiod Resource Allocation with Variable Technology
### Author(s):
- Gary R. Reeves
- James R. Sweigart
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
Planning the allocation of scarce resources to competing activities over multiple time periods is one of the most important problems facing decision makers in modern organizations. Much of the previous research in this area has concentrated on the use of linear programming procedures and has assumed that the technology through which scarce resource inputs are transformed into competing activity outputs is fixed. A more realistic assumption in many situations is that certain technology coefficients are likely to vary over the planning horizon as a function of activity levels in previous periods.

## 9. A Mathematical Programming Approach to Schedule Master Slab Casters in the Steel Industry
### Author(s):
- Mark A. Vonderembse
- Robert W. Haessler
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
This paper examines an important scheduling problem resulting from a new process for continuously casting steel. A master slab caster produces slabs which are wider than customer needs, and therefore, these must be ripped longitudinally at least once before they can be processed to a customer-specified width. The purpose of this research is to develop an effective and efficient algorithm for combining customer sizes in order to economically schedule the ripping process. Such a solution procedure could be used to assist decision-makers in selecting master slab widths for production and in designing width limitations for future casters. The method entails more than the minimization of trim loss because other costs are relevant. Mathematical programming is used to arrive at an optimal or near-optimal solution to this production management problem. The results indicate that the procedure described in this paper reduces to total costs dramatically.

## 10. NoteMultiplicative Interval Variation of Objective Function Coefficients in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Patrick G. McKeown
- Roland A. Minch
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
Traditional sensitivity analysis of linear programming objective function coefficients concerns itself with variations in single parameters. In a recent book, Gal developed a theoretical framework to determine the effect of multiple variations in the parameters. In this paper, we develop a methodology to implement and extend the theoretical results in the earlier work for interval variations of objective function coefficients. This methodology uses necessary and sufficient conditions to determine all optimal solutions to the linear programming problem for objective function coefficients within given intervals. The resulting procedure has been coded for computer use and tested on various types of test problems. Computational results and an example are presented.

## 11. Communications
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1982
### Abstract:
Communications are read for interest in issues that have importance for all who practice and use management science. They are not refereed for technical correctness, as are articles and Notes that appear in Management Science. The reader is therefore cautioned that the publication of any Communication implies neither scientific standing nor acceptance per se on the part of either Management Science or TIMS.
