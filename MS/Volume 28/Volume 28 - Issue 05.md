## 1. Dynamic Analysis of Consumer Response to Marketing Strategies
### Author(s):
- John R. Hauser
- Kenneth J. Wisniewski
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
This paper develops a methodology for modeling consumer response that integrates previous research in stochastic brand selection, diffusion of innovation, test market analysis, and new product design. The methodology makes it practical to extend brand selection models to include diffusion phenomena such as awareness, trial, and information flow. Purchase timing and brand selection are interdependent and both phenomena depend jointly on managerial controls such as advertising, coupons, price-off promotion, product positioning, and consumer characteristics.

## 2. Advertising Budget Allocation under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Duncan M. Holthausen, Jr.
- Gert Assmus
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
This article presents a model for the allocation of an advertising budget to geographic market segments, or territories, when the sales response to advertising in each segment is characterized by a probability distribution. It is shown that allocation decisions that are based on the expected sales response may be associated with a relatively large degree of risk and, therefore, non-optimal to a risk-averse manager. The model derives an efficient frontier in terms of the expected profit and its variance resulting from alternative budget allocations. The manager then chooses the optimal allocation based on his/her preference function.

## 3. The Advertising Budget's Determinants in a Market with Two Competing Firms
### Author(s):
- Julian L. Simon
- Joseph Ben-Ur
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
This is an exploratory study of the determinants of the size of the advertising budget in duopolistic competition. The model is a computer simulation that embodies learning, a multipenod decision horizon, brand loyalty, and other basic features of competitive reality in a two firm market.

## 4. A Simulation Analysis of Tour-Shift Construction Procedures
### Author(s):
- Vincent A. Mabert
- Charles A. Watts
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
Work force scheduling research over the last few years has concentrated on the shift scheduling problem in service oriented firms (telephone operators, postal employees, bank encoders, etc.). In all cases, the authors were primarily interested in the evaluating procedures (optimal and heuristic) to determine the appropriate number of workers to be assigned to the available set of work schedules to meet fluctuating work volumes. However, more attention should be given to how the available shift schedules were defined (start times, durations, etc.) and their impact on maintaining good productivity levels. This paper analyzes the impact of six different approaches in defining the available weekly tour-shift schedules. Tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the six approaches using operating data from Ohio National Bank for the check proof and encoding activity.

## 5. Using Simulation for Leadership and Management Research: Through the Looking Glass
### Author(s):
- Morgan W. McCall, Jr.
- Michael M. Lombardo
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
A case might be made that we have not learned very much about leadership in complex organizations. One factor contributing to this lack might be the narrowness of the traditional approach to leadership. By defining leadership as an interpersonal influence process, a research literature has been generated that focuses almost exclusively on leader-subordinate relationships, two or so styles, and group outcomes. Such a focus does not ask questions about the environmental and organizational context of leadership and the impacts it may have.

## 6. Confidence Intervals for Steady-State Simulations II: A Survey of Sequential Procedures
### Author(s):
- Averill M. Law
- W. David Kelton
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
We continue our survey of methods for constructing confidence intervals for steady-state means via simulation by studying sequential procedures which determine the length of the simulation during the course of the run. Our goal is to provide the simulation practitioner with some guidance as to which published procedures might actually perform well in practice. Empirical results for a variety of stochastic models with known steady-state means suggest that sequential procedures by Fishman and by Law and Carson provide good performance relative to the criterion probability of coverage.

## 7. Efficiency of the Antithetic Variate Method for Simulating Stochastic Networks
### Author(s):
- Robert S. Sullivan
- Jack C. Hayya
- Ronny Schaul
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the efficiency of antithetic variate simulation for estimating the expected completion time of stochastic networks. The method is compared with Monte Carlo simulation and considers both computation effort and the variance of the estimators. An efficiency ratio is first developed and then investigated within a theoretical framework. We then provide analytical proof of the superiority of the antithetic variate method for some networks whose activity durations are distributed symmetrically about their means. Next, experimental analysis of the efficiency ratio is carried out using test networks that are randomly structured and whose activity distributions are randomly assigned. The study shows that on the average the antithetic variate method can provide the same precision as Monte Carlo simulation, but with approximately 1/4 the computation effort. Furthermore, when activity distributions are symmetric, we can expect the antithetic variate method to require less than 1/10 the computation effort.

## 8. A Batching Approach to Quantile Estimation in Regenerative Simulations
### Author(s):
- Andrew F. Seila
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new method, called the batch quantile method, for estimating quantiles in regenerative simulations. The quantile estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, and the method can be easily implemented and does not require prior knowledge of the range of values the data will assume. Empirical studies show adequate coverage of confidence intervals when batches of 50 cycles or more are used.

## 9. NoteOn MRP Lot Sizing
### Author(s):
- John O. McClain
- William L. Maxwell
- John A. Muckstadt
- L. Joseph Thomas
- Elliott N. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 May 1982
### Abstract:
In this Note we present an alternative formulation to the MRP lot sizing model of Steinberg and Napier (SN) (Steinberg, E., H. A. Napier. 1980. Optimal multi-level lot sizing for requirements planning systems. Management Sci.26 (2) 12581271.). The alternative is more parsimonious and the notation less cumbersome. We also point out several errors in the formulation of the SN model which are significant for future research.
