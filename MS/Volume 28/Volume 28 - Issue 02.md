## 1. Subjective Probability and the Theory of Games
### Author(s):
- Joseph B. Kadane
- Patrick D. Larkey
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
This paper explores some of the consequences of adopting a modern subjective view of probability for game theory. The consequences are substantial. The subjective view of probability clarifies the important distinction between normative and positive theorizing about behavior in games, a distinction that is often lost in the search for solution concepts which largely characterizes game theory since the work of von Neumann and Morgenstern. Many of the distinctions that appear important in conventional game theory (two-person versus n-person, zero-sum versus variable sum) appear unimportant in the subjective formulation. Other distinctions, such as single play versus repetitive-play games, appear to be more important in the subjective formulation than in the conventional formulation.

## 2. CommentSubjective Probability and the Theory of Games: Comments on Kadane and Larkey's Paper
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
The normative solution concepts of game theory try to provide a clear mathematical characterization of what it means to act rationally in a game where all players expect each other to act rationally. Kadane and Larkey reject the use of these normative solution concepts. Yet, this amounts to throwing away an important piece of information to the effect that the players are rational and expect each other to be rational. Even in situations where the players do not expect each other to act with complete rationality, normative game theory can help them heuristically to formulate reasonable expectations about the other players' behavior.

## 5. On Poisson Approximations for Superposition Arrival Processes in Queues
### Author(s):
- S. L. Albin
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
We report on simulations of iGIi/M/1 queues; the arrival process is the superposition (sum) of up to 1024 i.i.d. renewal processes and there is a single exponential server. As one might anticipate, the simulation estimate of the expected number of customers in a iGIi/M/1 queueing system approaches the expected number in an M/M/1 queueing system as the number of arrival processes, n, increases. However, for a given n, the difference between the expected numbers in the M/M/1 and iGIi/M/1 queueing systems dramatically increases as the traffic intensity increases from  = 0.5 to  = 0.9. This difference is approximated by a formula which is a function of the traffic intensity, the number of component arrival processes and the squared coefficient of variation of the component interarrival times.

## 6. Organizational Information Systems: Determinants of Their Performance and Behavior
### Author(s):
- George Huber
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with organizational information systems. Examples of such systems include intelligence systems, communications systems, management information systems, decision support systems, and administrative control systems. Systems such as these are critical to an organization's functioning; indeed to its survival.

## 7. Firm's Forecasts of Engineering Employment
### Author(s):
- Peter Brach
- Edwin Mansfield
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
In this paper we present data concerning the accuracy of firm's forecasts of engineering employment and suggest a simple model that may be of use in improving their accuracy. The results, which pertain to 54 firms in the aerospace, electronics, chemical, and oil industries, should be of use to managers, because the formulation of proper manpower policies clearly depends on the precision of such forecasts. Our approach also may be applicable to personnel other than engineers: better forecasts may result from the application of this simple model.

## 8. Multi-Project Scheduling: Categorization of Heuristic Rules Performance
### Author(s):
- I. Kurtulus
- E. W. Davis
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
Application of heuristic solution procedures to the practical problem of project scheduling has previously been studied by numerous researchers. However, there is little consensus about their findings, and the practicing manager is currently at a loss as to which scheduling rule to use. Furthermore, since no categorization process was developed, it is assumed that once a rule is selected it must be used throughout the whole project. This research breaks away from this tradition by providing a categorization process based on two powerful project summary measures. The first measure identifies the location of the peak of total resource requirements and the second measure identifies the rate of utilization of each resource type. The performance of the rules are classified according to values of these two measures, and it is shown that a rule introduced by this research performs significantly better on most categories of projects.

## 9. A Renewal Theoretic Approach to Bias Reduction in Regenerative Simulations
### Author(s):
- Marc S. Meketon
- Philip Heidelberger
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
The special structure of regenerative processes is exploited to derive a new point estimate with very low bias for steady state quantities of regenerative simulations. If the simulation run length is t units of tune, the bias of the new estimate is of order 1/t2 as opposed to the bias of order 1/t associated with more standard estimates. The bias reduction is achieved by continuing the simulation until the first regeneration after time t and then forming the ratio estimate which involves the random number of regenerative cycles observed during the simulation. Empirical results for several queueing models demonstrate that the bias reduction can be substantial for small values of t.

## 10. An Experimental Comparison of Different Approaches to Determining Weights in Additive Utility Models
### Author(s):
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker
- C. Carter Waid
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
Several studies this past decade have examined differences between holistic and decomposed approaches to determining weights in additive utility models. Some have argued that it matters little which procedure is used, whereas others strongly favored particular methods. In this paper we address this controversy experimentally by comparing five conceptually different approaches in terms of their weights and predictive ability. The five methods are (1) multiple linear and non-linear regression analyses of ten and fifteen holistic assessments, (2) direct decomposed tradeoffs as proposed by Keeney and Raiffa (Keeney, R. L., H. Raiffa. 1977. Decisions with Multiple Objectives. Wiley, New York.), (3) a recent eigen-vector technique of Saaty (Saaty, T. L. 1977. A scaling method for priorities in hierarchical structures. J. Math. Psych.15 (3) 234281.) involving redundant pairwise comparisons of attributes, (4) a straightforward allocation of hundred importance points, and (5) unit weighting (i.e., equal weighting after standardizing the attributes).

## 11. Cost-Benefit Models for Explaining Consumer Choice and Information Seeking Behavior
### Author(s):
- Brian T. Ratchford
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
While it provides excellent descriptions of behavior, existing consumer research on information seeking and processing largely fails to explain why consumers engage in various types of activities. This paper presents an economic framework for measuring costs/benefits of search behavior which can help to resolve these questions. This work shows how such a framework can lead to testable hypotheses about information seeking, and discusses how operational measures of economic incentives to search can be developed and employed.

## 12. NoteAn Application of Closed-Form Error Analysis to Fiscal Impact Models
### Author(s):
- David A. Gulley
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1982
### Abstract:
For a variety of reasons, predictive power is not always a useful criterion of model validity. One alternative is a closed-form analysis of error propogation, but often the exact functional form is too unwieldy to use. A similar analysis is performed here, using a Taylor series approximation to the impact-multiplier submodel of a fiscal impact model, developed for coal and oil shale assessment.
