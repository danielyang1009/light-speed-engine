### Abstract:
The author's current decision-making environment is summarized. A short history of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System is given and then the recent changes made by the Reagan Administration are discussed.

## 2. A Markovian Decision Model for Deciding How Many Fire Companies to Dispatch
### Author(s):
- Arthur J. Swersey
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
In deciding how many units to dispatch to an incoming alarm of unknown seventy the fire department is faced with a dilemma: If too few units are sent initially the extra units needed will be delayed; if too many units are sent, the extra units make a needless response and are temporarily unavailable for subsequent alarms. In this paper, we present a Markovian decision model for this problem. The model leads to a simple decision rule that considers three key factors: (1) the probability that the incoming alarm is serious (the greater the probability the more units dispatched); (2) the expected alarm rate in the area surrounding the alarm (the greater the alarm rate, the fewer units dispatched); and (3) the number of units available in the area surrounding the alarm (the more units available, the more units dispatched). We compare the decision rule to policies commonly in use and find that it results in significant improvements in response time to serious fires.

## 3. An Algorithm for the Initial Dispatch of Fire Companies

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
In response to an incoming fire alarm, someone must decide how many and which engine and ladder companies (firefighters and their apparatus) to dispatch to the scene. Traditional dispatching policies assume that all of the designated companies are available at the time the alarm is received. These policies do not consider the workload imposed on firefighters, and do not work well at the high alarm rates now characteristic of parts of large cities. Our procedure, designed for use in New York City's computed-aided Management Information and Control System, makes good initial dispatch decisions at all alarm rates. It uses response times to serious fires to measure performance and recognizes that the dispatcher has incomplete information about the seriousness of the incident when the decision is made.

## 4. Toward Valid Measures of Public Sector Productivity: Performance Measures in Urban Transit
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
In recent years, performance measurement has become the focus of attention in a variety of public sector fields. Unfortunately, too little has been done to develop valid operational definitions of performance, or to identify the weaknesses and biases inherent m certain types of performance measures. Thus, the potential exists for the inappropriate use of certain indicators in performance evaluations and decisions. One field in which there has been increasing effort to deal with performance problems is that of transit. Regardless, the nebulous nature of performance has been all too apparent in this industry. The terms productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness have been used synonymously in some instances, while in other cases efficiency and effectiveness have been considered to be different aspects of overall productivity. This confusion is of major significance, because the use of performance measures in operations assessment, decision making, and resource allocation is increasing. Furthermore, since it increasingly is being urged that subsidy payments be linked to the performance of a transit system, and since subsidies now constitute over half of transit revenues, the performance measurement problem is particularly important.

## 5. The Impact of Inspector Fallibility on the Inspection Policy in Serial Production Systems
### Author(s):
- Donald P. Ballou
- Harold L. Pazer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
Appropriate inspection is a significant component of production systems. In this paper a model is developed to determine the optimal placement of inspection stations within n-stage linear production systems. This model accommodates two types of inspector fallibility: predictable, which implies that the error rates are known and constant, and erratic, which requires a random variable to describe inspector performance. Cost per good unit accepted by the customer is used as the optimizing criterion. The cost-quality response surface is explored through a sequential sensitivity analysis. Our results indicate that under certain conditions the level of predictable inspector fallibility significantly impacts the number and placement of inspection stations as well as cost per good unit produced. The modeled systems, however, were quite insensitive to the variability of inspector performance.

## 6. The Application of Queueing Theory to Continuous Perishable Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
This paper develops two distinct models for studying inventory systems with continuous production and perishable items. The perishable items have a deterministic usable life after which they must be outdated. For each of the models, analytical expressions derived from queueing theory, are found for the steady-state distribution of system inventory. Knowledge of this steady-state behavior may be used for evaluation of system performance, and for consideration of alternatives for improving system performance.

## 7. Spacecraft for Multi-Floor Layout Planning
### Author(s):
- Roger V. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
A descriptive problem definition and a tested computerized heuristic solution procedure are offered for the problem of relative location of facilities in (or layout of) a multi-floor building. The problem definition and solution procedure overcome the problem of severe nonlinearity of inter-department movement times relative to distance, which enter the multi-floor problem because of the indirectness of routing, and because of different movement speeds compared with the single floor case. Both the definition and solution procedure are application-oriented, concentrating on practical aspects of multi-floor space allocation. Substantial savings in an implementation are reported. The procedure is particularly relevant to planning for an organization moving into a new multi-floor building.

## 8. A Model of Technology Selection by Cost Minimizing Producers
### Author(s):
- Dean W. Boyd
- Robert L. Phillips
- Stephan G. Regulinski
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1982
### Abstract:
A set of microeconomic assumptions are presented that lead to a model of the technology choices made by producers of a homogenous energy product. Under these assumptions it is possible to model the technology selection decision as being made solely to minimize product cost. Since the cost of producing energy using a particular technology will be different for different producers, a number of technologies will be adopted in the market rather than a single, least-cost technology.
