### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
In dynamic facility location problems, one desires to select the time-staged establishment of facilities at different locations so as to minimize the total discounted costs for meeting demands specified over time at various customer locations. We formulate a particular dynamic facility location problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. The formulation permits both the opening of new facilities and the closing of existing ones. A branch-and-bound procedure incorporating a dual ascent method is presented and shown, in computational tests, to be superior to previously developed methods. The procedure is comparable to the most efficient methods for solving static (single-period) location problems. Problems with 25 potential facility locations, 50 customer locations, and 10 time periods have been solved within one second of CPU time on an IBM 3033 computer. Extensions of the dynamic facility location problem that allow price-sensitive demands, linearized concave costs, interdependent projects, multiple stages, and multiple commodities also can be solved by the dual ascent method. The method can serve as a component of a solution process for capacitated dynamic location problems.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
Successive Linear Programming (SLP), which is also known as the Method of Approximation Programming, solves nonlinear optimization problems via a sequence of linear programs. This paper reports on promising computational results with SLP that contrast with the poor performance indicated by previously published comparative tests. The paper provides a detailed description of an efficient, reliable SLP algorithm along with a convergence theorem for linearly constrained problems and extensive computational results. It also discusses several alternative strategies for implementing SLP. The computational results show that SLP compares favorably with the Generalized Reduced Gradient Code GRG2 and with MINOS/GRG. It appears that SLP will be most successful when applied to large problems with low degrees of freedom.

## 5. R&D Project Selection and Manpower Allocation with Integer Nonlinear Goal Programming

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
A number of recent research efforts in the area of research and development planning have indicated the necessity that the R&D project selection process be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. As a result, linear 0-1 goal programming, because of its ability to encompass multiple objectives, has been employed on several occasions as a project selection model. However, in these goal programming models the relationships between resource utilization and project outcomes or between various resource utilizations have been expressed linearly when, in reality, they are often non-linear. For example, as the resources allocated to a project are increased the probability of project success will also increase but at a decreasing rate. In this paper, a non-linear integer goal programming model is described via a case example. The case example encompasses a pool of thirty researchers available for allocation to seven possible R&D projects. As such, the model consists of integer decision variables for both the number of researchers allocated, and, project selection. Researcher allocation and project selection are subject to several linear and nonlinear goal constraints. Nonlinear goal constraints are constructed that relate the probability of project success to the number of researchers assigned to a project and to expected monetary return, and, that relate the number of researchers allocated to project completion time. Linear goal constraints are developed for budget limitations, computer capacity utilization and various strict conditions placed on the model. The model selects projects and allocates researchers to projects such that a prioritized goal structure is most satisfactorily achieved. The model solution of the case example indicated the selection of five of the seven projects and the number of researchers assigned to each project. Of the nine prioritized goals, six were achieved while three were only partially achieved.

## 6. A Production Function for Organizations Doing Case Work
### Author(s):
- Martin J. Beckmann
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
This paper examines the contribution of supervisors to an organization's output by constructing a production function in which supervisors' time and case workers' time enter as inputs. There is a quality variable associated with output: average delay. The functional form of the production function is derived for the simplest possible type of queuing model, but the method can be applied to other specifications of the queuing process and of the quality variable. Such a production function can be used to determine the most cost effective span of control. The model is extended to obtain a multi-factor production function for multi-level organizations. Numbers from a welfare agency are used as illustrations but no empirical validation is attempted.

## 7. The Capital Asset Pricing Model: An Evaluation of its Potential as a Strategic Planning Tool
### Author(s):
- Thomas H. Naylor
- Francis Tapon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
In this paper we provide a summary of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and point out how it might possibly be used as a tool for strategic planning by corporations that own a portfolio of businesses. We also point out some of the assumptions underlying the CAPM which must be satisfied if it is to be used for strategic planning. Next we include a critical appraisal of the CAPM as a strategic planning tool. Finally, we state the case for linking competitive strategy models, CAPM models, and business simulation models.

## 8. Computational Complexity of the Capacitated Lot Size Problem
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Horacio H. Yanasse
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the computational complexity of the capacitated lot size problem with a particular cost structure that is likely to be used in practical settings. For the single item case new properties are introduced, classes of problems solvable by polynomial time algorithms are identified, and efficient solution procedures are given. We show that special classes are NP-hard, and that the problem with two items and independent setups is NP-hard under conditions similar to those where the single item problem is easy. Topics for further research are discussed in the last section.

## 9. Group Confidence Pressures in Iterative Decisions
### Author(s):
- David M. Boje
- J. Keith Murnighan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of two group decision making techniques on a set of four problems in groups of sizes 3, 7, and 11. Participants included 192 male and 132 female undergraduates. Estimates that could be evaluated for accuracy for each of the problems were collected for a series of three trials. One set of groups received face-to-face verbal feedback from each other, while the other set received written feedback. These data were compared to mean estimates obtained from randomly selected, pooled individual estimates. The results suggested that the pooled individual estimates were somewhat more accurate than those obtained from either of the interacting groups. At the same time, all individuals became more confident of their answers, suggesting the possibility of groupthink. No effects for different group sizes were found, possibly due to the constraints imposed by the structured nature of the two techniques.

## 10. Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling with Time-Resource Tradeoffs: The Nonpreemptive Case
### Author(s):
- F. Brian Talbot
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1982
### Abstract:
This paper introduces methods for formulating and solving a general class of nonpreemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problems in which the duration of each job is a function of the resources committed to it. The approach is broad enough to permit the evaluation of numerous time or resource-based objective functions, while simultaneously taking into account a variety of constraint types. Typical of the objective functions permitted are minimize project duration, minimize project cost given performance payments and penalties, and minimize the consumption of a critical resource. Resources which may be considered include those which are limited on a period-to-period basis such as skilled labor, as well as those such as money, which are consumed and constrained over the life of the project. At the planning stage the user of this approach is permitted to identify several alternative ways, or modes, of accomplishing each job in the project. Each mode may have a different duration, reflecting the magnitude and mix of the resources allocated to it. At the scheduling phase, the procedure derives a solution which specifies how each job should be performed, that is, which mode should be selected, and when each mode should be scheduled. In order to make the presentation concrete, this paper focuses on two problems: given multiple resource restrictions, minimize project completion time, and minimize project cost. The latter problem is also known as the resource-constrained time-cost tradeoff problem.
