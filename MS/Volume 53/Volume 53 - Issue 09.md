### Abstract:
Recent technological and market forces have profoundly impacted the music industry. Emphasizing threats from peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the industry continues to seek sanctions against individuals who offer a significant number of songs for others to copy. Combining data on the performance of music albums on the Billboard charts with file sharing data from a popular network, we assess the impact of recent developments related to the music industry on survival of music albums on the charts and evaluate the specific impact of P2P sharing on an album's survival on the charts. In the post-P2P era, we find significantly reduced chart survival except for those albums that debut high on the charts. In addition, superstars and female artists continue to exhibit enhanced survival. Finally, we observe a narrowing of the advantage held by major labels. The second phase of our study isolates the impact of file sharing on album survival. We find that, although sharing does not hurt the survival of top-ranked albums, it does have a negative impact on low-ranked albums. These results point to increased risk from rapid information sharing for all but the cream of the crop.

### Abstract:
Extracting sentiment from text is a hard semantic problem. We develop a methodology for extracting small investor sentiment from stock message boards. The algorithm comprises different classifier algorithms coupled together by a voting scheme. Accuracy levels are similar to widely used Bayes classifiers, but false positives are lower and sentiment accuracy higher. Time series and cross-sectional aggregation of message information improves the quality of the resultant sentiment index, particularly in the presence of slang and ambiguity. Empirical applications evidence a relationship with stock valuestech-sector postings are related to stock index levels, and to volumes and volatility. The algorithms may be used to assess the impact on investor opinion of management announcements, press releases, third-party news, and regulatory changes.

## 4. Fair Payments for Efficient Allocations in Public Sector Combinatorial Auctions

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
Motivated by the increasing use of auctions by government agencies, we consider the problem of fairly pricing public goods in a combinatorial auction. A well-known problem with the incentive-compatible Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism is that the resulting prices may not be in the core. Loosely speaking, this means the payments of the winners could be so low, that there are bidders who would have been willing to pay more than the payments of the winning bidders. Clearly, this unfair outcome is unacceptable for a public sector auction. Recent advances in auction theory suggest that combinatorial auctions resulting in efficient outcomes and bidder-Pareto-optimal core payments offer a viable practical alternative to address this problem.

## 5. Should Price Increases Be Targeted?Pricing Power and Selective vs. Across-the-Board Price Increases
### Author(s):

- 1 Sep 2007
### Abstract:
Firms in many industries experience protracted periods of pricing power, the ability to successfully enact price increases. In these situations, firms must decide not only whether to raise prices, but to whom. Specifically, in a competitive context, they must determine whether it is more profitable to increase prices across-the-board or to a specific segment of their customer base. While selective price decreases are ubiquitous in practice (e.g., better deals to potential new customers by phone carriers; better deals to current customers by various magazines), to our knowledge selective price increases are relatively rare.

## 6. The Fragility of Time: Time-Insensitivity and Valuation of the Near and Far Future
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We propose that the temporal dimension is fragile in that choices are insufficiently sensitive to it, and second, such sensitivity as exists is exceptionally malleable, unlike other dimensions such as money, which are attended by default. To test this, we axiomatize a constant-sensitivity discount function, and in four studies, we show that the degree of time-sensitivity is inadequate relative to the compound discounting norm, and strongly susceptible to manipulation. Time-sensitivity is increased by a comparative within-subject presentation (Experiment 1), direct instruction (Experiment 3), and provision of a visual cue for time duration (Experiment 4); time-sensitivity is decreased using a time pressure manipulation (Experiment 2). In each study, the sensitivity manipulation has an opposite effect on near-future and far-future valuations: Increased sensitivity decreases discounting in the near future and increases discounting in the far future. In contrast, such sensitivity manipulations have little effect on the money dimension.

## 7. An Integrated Model for Hybrid Securities

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2007
### Abstract:
We develop a model for pricing securities whose value may depend simultaneously on equity, interest-rate, and default risks. The framework may also be used to extract probabilities of default (PD) functions from market data. Our approach is entirely based on observables such as equity prices and interest rates, rather than on unobservable processes such as firm value. The model stitches together in an arbitrage-free setting a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) equity model (to represent the behavior of equity prices prior to default), a default intensity process, and a Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for the evolution of riskless interest rates. The model captures several stylized features such as a negative relation between equity prices and equity volatility, a negative relation between default intensity and equity prices, and a positive relationship between default intensity and equity volatility. We embed the model on a discrete-time, recombining lattice, making implementation feasible with polynomial complexity. We demonstrate the simplicity of calibrating the model to market data and of using it to extract default information. The framework is extensible to handling correlated default risk and may be used to value distressed convertible bonds, debt-equity swaps, and credit portfolio products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Applied to the CDX INDU (credit default indexindustrials) Index, we find the S&P 500 index explains credit premia.

## 8. Valuing R&D Projects in a Portfolio: Evidence from the Pharmaceutical Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
Understanding the value of a product development project is central to a firm's choice of project portfolio. The value of a project to a firm depends not only on its properties but also on the other projects being developed by the firm. This is due to interactions with the other projects that address the same consumer need and require the same development resources. In this study, we empirically investigate the structure and significance of these portfolio-level project interactions. Using a self-developed pharmaceutical industry data set, we conduct an event study around the failure of phase III clinical trials and their effect on the market valuation of the firm. The study exploits the natural experiment of a product development failure to give us a measure of the value of a drug development project to a firm. We then explain the variance in the value of projects based on interactions with other projects in the firm's portfolio. We find that the presence of other projects targeting the same market and a build-up of projects that require the same development resources reduce the value of a development project. In addition to providing evidence on the significance and structure of these portfolio-level project interactions, the empirical model estimated in this paper also provides a data-driven approach to valuing projects that may be relevant to licensing transactions.

## 9. Managing a Single-Product Assemble-to-Order System with Technology Innovations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a multicomponent, single-product assemble-to-order (ATO) system that faces frequent, component-based technology innovations. For each component, there are two technologies with overlapping life cycles coexisting in the market. All cost parameters associated with each technology (procurement cost, salvage value, etc.) evolve dynamically. We investigate two technology-inventory coordination schemes, one is at the strategic level, where technology and inventory decisions are sequentially made using partial information, and another is at the operational level, where technology and inventory decisions are jointly made using full information. The performance gap between the two coordination schemes quantifies the value of incorporating dynamic inventory information in technology management. We develop effective solution techniques and approximation methods and characterize their policy structures. Our numerical study indicates that the strategic-level technology-inventory coordination is generally sufficient, but the operational-level coordination becomes necessary when demand variability is high and salvage loss is heavy. We also propose a hybrid technology-inventory coordination scheme, whereby the firm adopts a technology management plan using the strategic-level coordination scheme, but executes it dynamically by adapting to inventory information, using a heuristic proposed in this paper. Our numerical study suggests that the hybrid strategy can virtually achieve the performance of the optimal operational level coordination. Our analysis provides guidelines for the effective technology-adoption and inventory-control coordination strategies in the ATO system with rapid innovations.

## 10. A Single-Product Inventory Model for Multiple Demand Classes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a single-product inventory system that serves multiple demand classes, which differ in their shortage costs or service-level requirements. We assume a critical-level control policy, and a backorder clearing mechanism in which we treat a backorder for a lower-priority class equivalent to a reserve-stock shortfall for the higher-priority class. We show the equivalence between this inventory system and a serial inventory system. Based on this equivalence, we develop a model for cost evaluation and optimization under the assumptions of Poisson demand, deterministic replenishment lead time, and a continuous-review (Q, R) policy with rationing. We propose a computationally efficient heuristic and develop a bound on its performance. We provide a numerical experiment to show the effectiveness of the heuristic and the value from a rationing policy. Finally, we describe how to extend the model to permit service times, and how to extend the model to a multi-echelon setting.

## 11. Ranking Contingent Monitoring Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
This paper seeks to provide a ranking of information systems in a setting of contingent monitoring. Control strategies that make the acquisition of additional information conditional on observing certain outcomes largely elude the existing ranking criteria. We show that this happens because contingent monitoring involves more than the classical trade-off between risk sharing and incentives; it also requires a balancing of incentives and downside risk. We then develop a refinement of the most common information system orderings that conveys this feature. This allows us to reinterpret and generalize some of the literature's key results concerning, for instance, auditing policies with independent or with correlated signals and monitoring systems where the precision of an added signal is endogenous.

## 12. Research NoteStrategic Bid-Shading and Sequential Auctioning with Learning from Past Prices
### Author(s):
- Robert Zeithammer
### Published:
- 25 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes sequential auctioning of single units of an indivisible good to a fluctuating population composed of overlapping generations of unit-demand bidders. Two phenomena emergent in such a market are investigated: forward-looking bidding strategies, and closed-loop selling strategies that involve learning from past prices. The buyers shade their bids down, i.e., bid less than they would in a single isolated auction, whenever they expect the seller to sell another unit of the good in the near future. Unlike in exogenous sequences of auctions, the optimal bidding strategy thus depends on the seller's selling strategy. The converse dependence also occurs: the seller can learn about current demand from past realized prices, and sell only in periods with high-enough demand. Such learning depends on the extent of bid-shading because the seller needs to invert the bidding strategy to learn. In equilibrium, buyer bid-shading persists even when the seller does not sell in every period, but it is self-regulating in that it eventually vanishes when the existence of the market is threatened by low seller profits. In this sense, auction markets have a self-preservation instinct. General properties of learning about current demand from past auction prices are also investigated and characterized.
