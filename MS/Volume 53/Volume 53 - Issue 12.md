### Abstract:
This paper develops empirical proxy measures of information technology (IT) risk and incorporates them into the usual empirical models for analyzing IT returns: production function and market value specifications. The results suggest that IT capital investments make a substantially larger contribution to overall firm risk than non-IT capital investments. Further, firms with higher IT risk have a higher marginal product of IT relative to firms with low IT risk. In the market value specification, the impact of IT risk is positive and significant, and inclusion of the IT risk term substantially reduces the coefficient on IT capital. We estimate that about 30% of the gross return on IT investment corresponds to the risk premium associated with IT risk. Taken together, our results show that IT risk provides part of the explanation for the unusually high valuations of IT capital investment in recent research.

### Abstract:
Performance-based contracting is reshaping service support supply chains in capital-intensive industries such as aerospace and defense. Known as power by the hour in the private sector and as performance-based logistics (PBL) in defense contracting, it aims to replace traditionally used fixed-price and cost-plus contracts to improve product availability and reduce the cost of ownership by tying a supplier's compensation to the output value of the product generated by the customer (buyer).

## 4. Implications of Breach Remedy and Renegotiation Design for Innovation and Capacity
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Amanufacturer writes supply contracts with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts to achieve an efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the supply contract to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a buyer grants a financial hostage to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from renegotiation. Tradable options, which grant buyers the right to trade capacity without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers. This paper proves that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate their investments with the simplest of supply contracts (fixed-quantity contracts). This may require renegotiation design, and certainly requires that the firms understand the breach remedy and set their contract parameters accordingly.

## 5. Implications of Renegotiation for Optimal Contract Flexibility and Investment

### Abstract:
In a stylized model of biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing, this paper shows how the potential for renegotiation influences the optimal structure of supply contracts, investments in innovation and capacity, the way scarce capacity is allocated, and firms' resulting profits. Two buyers contract for capacity with a common manufacturer. Then, the buyers invest in innovation (product development and marketing) and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, the firms may renegotiate to allow a buyer facing poor market conditions to purchase less than the contractual commitment and a buyer facing favorable conditions to purchase more. We show that renegotiation can greatly increase the firms' investments and profits, provided that the contracts are designed correctly. Failing to anticipate renegotiation leads to contracts that allow too much flexibility in the buyer's order quantity, and perform poorly relative to contracts designed to anticipate renegotiation. We provide clear conditions under which quantity flexibility contracts with renegotiation coordinate the system. Where quantity flexibility contracts fail, employing tradable options improves performance.

## 6. The Role of Pre-Entry Experience, Entry Timing, and Product Technology Strategies in Explaining Firm Survival
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Studying the U.S. personal computer industry from its inception in 1974 through 1994, we address the following questions. What product technology strategies increase the survival chances of entrants into new, technologically dynamic industries? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by pre-entry experience? Does the effectiveness of these strategies differ by when firms enter a new industry? Consistent with the published literature, we find that diversifying entrants have an initial survival advantage over entrepreneurial startups. But, we find the reverse for later entrants: startups that enter later in the industry have a survival advantage over the later entering diversifying entrants. We explain this finding in terms of the firms' product technology strategies (i.e., offering products based on the technology standard and products incorporating the latest technology), pre-entry experience, and entry timing. Our findings highlight that it is crucial to study what firms do after they enter a new industry to more completely understand their ultimate performance.

## 7. Conditions That Shape the Learning Curve: Factors That Increase the Ability and Opportunity to Learn
### Author(s):
- Eelke Wiersma
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2007
### Abstract:
Prior studies examining factors that influence the learning curve mainly focus on settings in which firms adopt new products or technologies or open new plants or assembly lines. Less is known, however, about how more mature firms learn, when they are further down the learning curve. To gain insight into factors that enhance learning in this situation, I examine factors that increase both the ability and the opportunity to learn. I hypothesize that the ability to learn is enhanced by the presence of a moderate amount of temporary employees in the workforce and by providing employees with related variation in tasks, measured by product heterogeneity. In addition, I hypothesize that opportunities for learning are created when there is some slack in resources and when there are no problems in other important performance dimensions that consume employee attention.

## 8. Selecting a Selection Procedure

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2007
### Abstract:
Selection procedures are used in a variety of applications to select the best of a finite set of alternatives. Best is defined with respect to the largest mean, but the mean is inferred with statistical sampling, as in simulation optimization. There are a wide variety of procedures, which begs the question of which selection procedure to select. The main contribution of this paper is to identify, through extensive experimentation, the most effective selection procedures when samples are independent and normally distributed. We also (a) summarize the main structural approaches to deriving selection procedures, (b) formalize new sampling allocations and stopping rules, (c) identify strengths and weaknesses of the procedures, (d) identify some theoretical links between them, and (e) present an innovative empirical test bed with the most extensive numerical comparison of selection procedures to date. The most efficient and easiest to control procedures allocate samples with a Bayesian model for uncertainty about the means and use new adaptive stopping rules proposed here.

### Abstract:
In this paper, we examine the pattern of correlation among consumer price sensitivities for customer purchase incidence decisions across complementary product categories. We use a hierarchical Bayesian multivariate probit model to uncover this pattern. We estimated this model using purchase incidence data for six categories involving three pairs of complementary products.

## 10. A Framework for Reconciling Attribute Values from Multiple Data Sources

### Abstract:
Because of the heterogeneous nature of different data sources, data integration is often one of the most challenging tasks in managing modern information systems. While the existing literature has focused on problems such as schema integration and entity identification, it has largely overlooked a basic question: When an attribute value for a real-world entity is recorded differently in different databases, how should the best value be chosen from the set of possible values? This paper provides an answer to this question. We first show how a probability distribution over a set of possible values can be derived. We then demonstrate how these probabilities can be used to solve a given decision problem by minimizing the total cost of type I, type II, and misrepresentation errors. Finally, we propose a framework for integrating multiple data sources when a single best value has to be chosen and stored for every attribute of an entity.

## 11. The Machine Maintenance and Sale Age Model of Kamien and Schwartz Revisited
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
In this paper, we revisit and clarify the celebrated machine maintenance and sale age model of Kamien and Schwartz (KS) involving a machine subject to failure. KS formulate and solve the problem as a deterministic optimal control problem with the probability of the machine failure as the state variable. Thus, they obtain deterministic optimal maintenance and sale date. We study two underlying stochastic models with known and random machine modes, and clarify the relationship between the resulting value functions to that of KS. In particular, our maintenance and sale date decisions, when the machine is in operation, are precisely the ones obtained from the deterministic solution of KS. We explain why that is so. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for an optimal maintenance and sale date policy that is missing in KS. We describe many applications of the KS model in areas other than that of machine maintenance. We conclude the paper with extensions of the KS problem that are stochastic control problems not easily solvable or not at all solvable as deterministic problems.
