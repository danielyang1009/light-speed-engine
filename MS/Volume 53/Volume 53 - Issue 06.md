## 2. An Analysis of Short-Term Responses to Threats of Terrorism
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Two important defensive mechanisms available to governments combating terrorism are warnings and the deployment of physical resources. Warnings are relatively inexpensive to issue but their effectiveness suffers from false alarms. Physical deployments of trained security personnel can directly thwart attacks but are expensive and need to be targeted to specific locations. In this paper, we model the joint optimization of defenses against terrorist attacks based on warnings and physical deployments when there is uncertainty in the timing and location of attacks. We model both private warnings issued to security forces and public warnings broadcast to the general public. By structuring the trade-offs faced by decision makers in a formal way, we try to shed light on an important public policy problem. We show that the interaction between the use of warnings and physical defenses is complex and significant. For public warnings, we also model the possible response of terrorists and show how these responses influence the effectiveness of such warnings.

### Abstract:
Movie studios often have to choose among thousands of scripts to decide which ones to turn into movies. Despite the huge amount of money at stake, this processknown as green-lighting in the movie industryis largely a guesswork based on experts experience and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to help studios evaluate scripts that will then lead to more profitable green-lighting decisions. Our approach combines screenwriting domain knowledge, natural-language processing techniques, and statistical learning methods to forecast a movies return on investment (ROI) based only on textual information available in movie scripts. We test our model in a holdout decision task to show that our model is able to significantly improve a studios gross ROI.

### Abstract:
This paper contributes to research on organizational learning by investigating specific learning activities undertaken by improvement project teams in hospital intensive care units and proposing an integrative model to explain implementation success. Organizational learning is important in this context because medical knowledge changes constantly and hospital care units must learn new practices if they are to provide high-quality care. To develop a model of factors affecting improvement project teams driving essential organizational learning in health care, we draw from three streams of related researchbest-practice transfer (BPT), team learning (TL), and process change (PC). To test the models hypotheses, we collected data from 23 neonatal intensive care units seeking to implement new or improved practices. We first analyzed the frequency of specific learning activities reported by improvement project participants and discovered two distinct factors: learn-what (activities that identify current best practices) and learn-how (activities that operationalize practices in a given setting). Next, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses supported three of our four hypotheses. Specifically, a high level of supporting evidence for a units portfolio of improvement projects was associated with implementation success. Learn-how was positively associated with implementation success, but learn-what was not. Psychological safety was associated with learn-how, which was found to mediate between psychological safety and implementation success.

## 5. How Much Did the Liberty Shipbuilders Forget?
### Author(s):
- Peter Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
This paper produces new estimates of the rate of organizational forgetting in the well-known case study of U.S. wartime ship production. Estimates obtained using data constructed from primary sources at the National Archives yield rates of forgetting that are much smaller than previously reported, and may well be zero. The richness of the data makes it possible to control for variations in the product mix, to explore alternative formulations for the learning curve, and to investigate the relationship between organizational forgetting and labor turnover.

## 6. When Do Employees Become Entrepreneurs?
### Author(s):
- Thomas Hellmann
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
This paper examines an economic theory of when employees become entrepreneurs. It jointly addresses the two fundamental questions of when employees generate innovations, and whether these innovations are developed as internal ventures or outside the firm. The model shows that if generating innovations distracts employees from their assigned tasks, firms may discourage innovation. Firms may reject profitable opportunities that fall outside of their core activities. If employees own the intellectual property (IP), they may leave to do a start-up. The allocation of IP rights also affects the generation of innovation. The external entrepreneurial environment is a complement to firm-internal innovation. If the external environment is particularly good, firms may embrace employee innovation and take advantage of it through spin-offs.

## 7. Category Management and Coordination in Retail Assortment Planning in the Presence of Basket Shopping Consumers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
This paper studies the assortment planning problem with multiple merchandise categories and basket shopping consumers (i.e., consumers who desire to purchase from multiple categories). We present a duopoly model in which retailers choose prices and variety level in each category and consumers make their store choice between retail stores and a no-purchase alternative based on their utilities from each category. The common practice of category management (CM) is an example of a decentralized regime for controlling assortment because each category manager is responsible for maximizing his or her assigned categorys profit. Alternatively, a retailer can make category decisions across the store with a centralized regime. We show that CM never finds the optimal solution and provides both less variety and higher prices than optimal. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that profit loss due to CM can be significant. Finally, we propose a decentralized regime that uses basket profits, a new metric, rather than accounting profits. Basket profits are easily evaluated using point-of-sale data, and the proposed method produces near-optimal solutions.

## 8. Electronic B2B Marketplaces with Different Ownership Structures

- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes electronic marketplaces with different ownership structures: biased marketplaces and neutral marketplaces. Biased marketplaces can be either buyer-owned or supplier-owned, whereas neutral marketplaces are owned by independent third parties. We develop a single-period model, with fulfilled expectations equilibrium. The buyers experience positive network effects that are a function of the number of suppliers and the suppliers receive similar positive network effects depending on the number of buyers. We develop a general model with atomistic buyers and suppliers. We find that biased marketplaces set prices to induce greater participation (demand) from both buyers and suppliers compared to a neutral marketplace. This counterintuitive result can be understood in the context of the positive cross-network effects experienced by buyers and suppliers and the added benefit to the owner of a biased marketplace from participating in the marketplace. Biased marketplaces also provide greater social welfare compared to neutral marketplaces.

## 9. Analysis and Comparison of Queues with Different Levels of Delay Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
Information about delays can enhance service quality in many industries. Delay information can take many forms, with different degrees of precision. Different levels of information have different effects on customers and therefore on the overall system. To explore these effects, we consider a queue with balking under three levels of delay information: no information, partial information (the system occupancy), and full information (the exact waiting time). We assume Poisson arrivals, independent exponential service times, and a single server. Customers decide whether to stay or balk based on their expected waiting costs, conditional on the information provided. We show how to compute the key performance measures in the three systems, obtaining closed-form solutions for special cases. We then compare the three systems. We identify some important cases where more accurate delay information improves performance. In other cases, however, information can actually hurt the provider or the customers.

## 10. Service Performance Analysis and Improvement for a Ticket Queue with Balking Customers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
Queueing systems managed by ticket technology are widely used in service industries as well as government offices. Upon arriving at a ticket queue, each customer is issued a numbered ticket. The number currently being served is displayed. An arriving customer balks if the difference between his ticket number and the displayed number exceeds his patience level. We propose a Markov chain model of a ticket queue and develop effective evaluation tools. These tools can help management quantify the service level and identify the performance gap between the ticket queue and the conventional physical queue, in which a waiting line is formed. We gain insights about the ways customer service is affected by information loss in the ticket queue. In particular, we show that ticket and physical queues have significantly different balking probabilities when customer patience is low and the system traffic is heavy. We also propose an improvement to the ticket queue that provides each customer with his expected waiting time conditioned on his observed number difference, which is shown to raise the performance of the ticket queue to that of the physical queue.

## 11. Performance Bounds for Flexible Systems Requiring Setups

### Abstract:
Many organizations use product variety as one possible strategy for increasing their competitiveness. They have installed flexible manufacturing systems because these systems offer a powerful means for accommodating production and assembly of a variety of products. However, increased product variety comes at a cost. For instance, if the resource requires to be set up each time it switches to operate on a new product, the resulting delays and costs could negate the intended benefits of increased product variety. Analyzing these flexible resources for optimal design and operation is therefore very important. To address such issues, we model a flexible resource, serving multiple products, using a queueing modelmore precisely, a polling model. In this model, a single server attends to multiple service centers (queues) at which requests arrive and queue up for service, performing a setup at a polled queue only if that queue is nonempty. This is the state dependent (SD) polling model.

## 12. Performance of Portfolios Optimized with Estimation Error
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
We explain the poor out-of-sample performance of mean-variance optimized portfolios, developing theoretical bias adjustments for estimation risk by asymptotically expanding future returns of portfolios formed with estimated weights. We provide closed-form non-Bayesian adjustments of classical estimates of portfolio mean and standard deviation. The adjustments significantly reduce bias in international equity portfolios, increase economic gains, and are robust to sample size and to nonnormality. Dominant terms grow linearly with the number of assets and decline inversely with the number of past time periods. Under suitable conditions, Sharpe-ratio maximizing tangency portfolios become more diversified. Using these approximation methods it may be possible to assess, before investing, the effect of statistical estimation error on portfolio performance.

## 13. Gain-Loss Separability and Coalescing in Risky Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
This experiment tested two behavioral properties of risky decision makinggain-loss separability (GLS) and coalescing. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) implies both properties, but the transfer of attention exchange (TAX) model violates both. Original prospect theory satisfies GLS but may or may not satisfy coalescing, depending on whether editing rules are assumed. A configural form of CPT proposed by Wu and Markle [Wu, G., A. B. Markle. 2004. An empirical test of gain-loss separability in prospect theory. Working Paper 06-25-04, Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago] violates GLS, but satisfies coalescing. New tests were designed and conducted to test these theories against specific predictions of a TAX model. This model used parameters estimated from previous data, together with simple new assumptions to extend TAX to gambles with negative and mixed consequences. Contrary to all three forms of prospect theory, systematic violations of both coalescing and GLS were observed. Violations of GLS were confirmed by analyses of individual data patterns by means of an error model in which each choice can have a different rate of error. Without estimating any parameters from the new data, the TAX model predicted the majority choices in the new data fairly well, correctly predicting when modal choices would violate GLS, when they would satisfy it, and when indifference would be observed.

## 14. ErratumA Contract and Balancing Mechanism for Sharing Capacity in a Communication Network
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2007
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, the first three authors proposed a method for determining how much to charge users of a communication network when they share bandwidth, and studied the existence and form of Nash equilibria for players choices of capacity. However, the proof of one of the propositions in that paper contained a flaw. In this note, we prove that the original proposition is true under an additional condition, and provide two examples to show that this condition is necessary.
