### Abstract:
In this introductory note, we describe the motivation for this special issue on complex systems. We begin by noting the potential management opportunities offered by recent advances in complexity science. After defining the nature of complex systems and the many ways they are expressed in organizations and markets, we briefly describe the main tools and concepts of complexity theory. We close with a brief review of the articles in this issue and their relevance to the interests and concerns of managers.

### Abstract:
We study the problem of cooperative behavior emerging in an environment where individual behaviors and interaction structures coevolve. Players not only learn which strategy to adopt by imitating the strategy of the best-performing player they observe, but also choose with whom they should interact by selectively creating and/or severing ties with other players based on a myopic cost-benefit comparison. We find that scalable cooperationthat is, high levels of cooperation in large populationscan be achieved in sparse networks, assuming that individuals are able to sever ties unilaterally and that new ties can only be created with the mutual consent of both parties. Detailed examination shows that there is an important trade-off between local reinforcement and global expansion in achieving cooperation in dynamic networks. As a result, networks in which ties are costly and local structure is largely absent tend to generate higher levels of cooperation than those in which ties are made easily and friends of friends interact with high probability, where the latter result contrasts strongly with the usual intuition.

### Abstract:
In this paper, we model the formation of innovation networks as they emerge from bilateral decisions. In contrast to much of the literature, here firms only consider knowledge production, and not network issues, when deciding on partners. Thus, we focus attention on the effects of the knowledge and information regime on network formation. The effectiveness of a bilateral collaboration is determined by cognitive, relational, and structural embeddedness. Innovation results from the recombination of knowledge held by the partners to the collaboration, and its success is determined in part by the extent to which firms knowledge complement each other. Previous collaborations (relational embeddedness) increase the probability of a successful collaboration, as does information gained from common third parties (structural embeddedness). Repeated alliance formation creates a network. Two features are central to the innovation process: how firms pool their knowledge resources, and how firms derive information about potential partners. When innovation is decomposable into separate subtasks, networks tend to be dense; when structural embeddedness is important, networks become cliquish. For some regions in this parameter space, small worlds emerge.

## 5. Patterned Interactions in Complex Systems: Implications for Exploration
### Author(s):

- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
Scholars who view organizational, social, and technological systems as sets of interdependent decisions have increasingly used simulation models from the biological and physical sciences to examine system behavior. These models shed light on an enduring managerial question: How much exploration is necessary to discover a good configuration of decisions? The models suggest that, as interactions across decisions intensify and local optima proliferate, broader exploration is required. The models typically assume, however, that the interactions among decisions are distributed randomly. Contrary to this assumption, recent empirical studies of real organizational, social, and technological systems show that interactions among decisions are highly patterned. Patterns such as centralization, small-world connections, power-law distributions, hierarchy, and preferential attachment are common. We embed such patterns into an NK simulation model and obtain dramatic results: Holding fixed the total number of interactions among decisions, a shift in the pattern of interaction can alter the number of local optima by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, the long-run value of broader exploration is significantly greater in the face of some interaction patterns than in the face of others. We develop simple, intuitive rules of thumb that allow a decision maker to examine two interaction patterns and determine which warrants greater investment in broad exploration. We also find that, holding fixed the interaction pattern, an increase in the number of interactions raises the number of local optima regardless of the pattern. This validates prior comparative static results with respect to the number of interactions, but highlights an important implicit assumption in earlier workthat the underlying interaction pattern remains constant as interactions become more numerous.

## 6. Membership Herding and Network Stability in the Open Source Community: The Ising Perspective
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to conceptually understand membership dynamics in the open source software (OSS) community, and (2) to explore how different network characteristics (i.e., network size and connectivity) influence the stability of an OSS network. Through the lens of Ising theory, which is widely accepted in physics, we investigate basic patterns of interaction and present fresh conceptual insight into dynamic and reciprocal relations among OSS community members. We also perform computer simulations based on empirical data collected from two actual OSS communities. Key findings include: (1) membership herding is highly present when external influences (e.g., the availability of other OSS projects) are weak, but decreases significantly when external influences increase, (2) propensity for membership herding is most likely to be seen in a large network with random connectivity, and (3) for large networks, when external influences are weak, random connectivity will result in higher network strength than scale-free connectivity (as external influences increase, however, the reverse phenomenon is observed). In addition, scale-free connectivity appears to be less volatile than random connectivity in response to an increase in the strength of external influences. We conclude with several implications that may be of significance to OSS stakeholders in particular, and to a broader range of online communities in general.

## 7. Call-Center Labor Cross-Training: Its a Small World After All

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
It is well known that flexibility can be created in manufacturing and service operations by using multipurpose production sources such as cross-trained labor, flexible machines, or flexible factories. We focus on flexible service centers, such as inbound call centers with cross-trained agents, and model them as parallel queueing systems with flexible servers. We propose a new approach to analyzing flexibility arising from the multifunctionality of sources of production. We create a work sharing (WS) network model for which its average shortest path length (APL) metric can predict the more effective of two alternative cross-training structures in terms of customer waiting times. We show that the APL metric of small world network (SWN) theory is one simple deterministic solution approach to the complex stochastic problem of designing effective workforce cross-training structures in call centers.

## 8. Interfirm Collaboration Networks: The Impact of Large-Scale Network Structure on Firm Innovation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
The structure of alliance networks influences their potential for knowledge creation. Dense local clustering provides information transmission capacity in the network by fostering communication and cooperation. Nonredundant connections contract the distance between firms and give the network greater reach by tapping a wider range of knowledge resources. We propose that firms embedded in alliance networks that exhibit both high clustering and high reach (short average path lengths to a wide range of firms) will have greater innovative output than firms in networks that do not exhibit these characteristics. We find support for this proposition in a longitudinal study of the patent performance of 1,106 firms in 11 industry-level alliance networks.

## 9. The Statistical Mechanics of Complex Product Development: Empirical and Analytical Results

### Abstract:
In recent years, understanding the structure and function of complex networks has become the foundation for explaining many different real-world complex biological, technological, and informal social phenomena. Techniques from statistical physics have been successfully applied to the analysis of these networks, and have uncovered surprising statistical structural properties that have also been shown to have a major effect on their functionality, dynamics, robustness, and fragility. This paper examines, for the first time, the statistical properties of strategically important organizational networksnetworks of people engaged in distributed product development (PD)and discusses the significance of these properties in providing insight into ways of improving the strategic and operational decision making of the organization. We show that the structure of information flow networks that are at the heart of large-scale product development efforts have properties that are similar to those displayed by other social, biological, and technological networks. In this context, we also identify novel properties that may be characteristic of other information-carrying networks. We further present a detailed model and analysis of PD dynamics on complex networks, and show how the underlying network topologies provide direct information about the characteristics of these dynamics. We believe that our new analysis methodology and empirical results are also relevant to other organizational information-carrying networks.

## 10. Analyzing Consumer-Product Graphs: Empirical Findings and Applications in Recommender Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We apply random graph modeling methodology to analyze bipartite consumer-product graphs that represent sales transactions to better understand consumer purchase behavior in e-commerce settings. Based on two real-world e-commerce data sets, we found that such graphs demonstrate topological features that deviate significantly from theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In particular, we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path lengths and a greater-than-expected tendency to cluster. Such deviations suggest that the consumers product choices are not random even with the consumer and product attributes hidden. Our findings provide justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only on previous sales transactions. By analyzing the simulated consumer-product graphs generated by models that embed two representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these recommendation algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random graphs. However, consistent deviations in topological features remained. These findings motivated the development of a new recommendation algorithm based on graph partitioning, which aims to achieve high clustering coefficients similar to those observed in the real-world e-commerce data sets. We show empirically that this algorithm significantly outperforms representative collaborative filtering algorithms in situations where the observed clustering coefficients of the consumer-product graphs are sufficiently larger than can be accounted for by these standard algorithms.

## 11. Complexity and the Character of Stock Returns: Empirical Evidence and a Model of Asset Prices Based on Complex Investor Learning
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
Empirical evidence on the distributional characteristics of common stock returns indicates: (1) A power-law tail index close to three describes the behavior of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns (pr(r > x)  x ), a reflection of fat tails; (2) general linear and nonlinear dependencies exist in the time series of returns; (3) the time-series return process is characterized by short-run dependence (short memory) in both returns as well as their volatility, the latter usually characterized in the form of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; and (4) the time-series return process probably does not exhibit long memory, but the squared returns process does exhibit long memory. We propose a model of complex, self-referential learning and reasoning amongst economic agents that jointly produces security returns consistent with these general observed facts and which are supported here by empirical results presented for a benchmark sample of 50 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market we postulate is populated by traders who reason inductively while compressing information into a few fuzzy notions that they can in turn process and analyze with fuzzy logic. We analyze the implications of such behavior for the returns on risky securities within the context of an artificial stock market model. Dynamic simulation experiments of the market are conducted, from which market-clearing prices emerge, allowing us to then compute realized returns. We test the effects of varying values of the parameters of the model on the character of the simulated returns. The results indicate that the model proposed in this paper can jointly account for the presence of a power-law characterization of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns with exponent on the order of three, for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, for long memory in volatility, and for general nonlinear dependencies in returns.

## 12. Emergent Properties of a New Financial Market: American Venture Capital Syndication, 19602005
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
The recorded transactions of venture capital investments permit a direct examination of the Braudel hypothesis that regional markets evolve dynamically and interdependently in reference to a global system. This hypothesis contradicts the popular belief that regional financial development is anchored in dense clusters. Using methods of complex graphs, we analyze 159,561 transactions over nearly 45 years to demonstrate the rapid emergence of a national network of syndications. A giant component emerges early in the history of the industry, which subsumes the regional and sectoral subgraphs. The results confirm the Braudel hypothesis over the role of regional clusters, rejects preferential attachment in favor of repeated ties among trusted partners, and emphasizes the importance of dynamics and complex weighted graphs for the analysis of social and economic behavior.
