## 2. Managerial Turnover and Strategic Change
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The connection between strategic change and managerial turnover is studied within a model where managers decide on a firm's strategy. Managers as well as firm owners care for the long-term success of a company, but managers are also interested in their own reputation. Due to reputational concerns, managers are reluctant to alter strategic decisions they themselves made in the past even when internal accounting information indicates that they should do so. It is shown that it may well be optimal in some cases to dismiss managers of higher ability while someone less talented may be kept in office when strategic change has to be enforced.

## 3. The Debate on Influencing Doctors' Decisions: Are Drug Characteristics the Missing Link?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
Decision making by physicians on patients' treatment has come under increased public scrutiny. In fact, there is a fair amount of debate on the effects of marketing actions of pharmaceutical firms toward physicians and their impact on physician prescription behavior. While some scholars find a strong and positive influence of marketing actions, some find only moderate effects, and others even find negative effects. Debate is also mounting on the role of other influencers (such as patient requests) in physician decision making, both on prescriptions and sample dispensing. The authors argue that one factor that may tip the balance in this debate is the role of drug characteristics, such as a drug's effectiveness and a drug's side effects.

### Abstract:
The only therapy for a patient with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is liver transplantation, which is performed by using either a cadaveric liver from a deceased donor or a portion of a living-donor's liver. This study addresses the following decision problem for an ESLD patient with an available living donor. Should she have a transplantation now or wait? If she decides to have the transplantation now, should she use her living-donor liver or a cadaveric liver for transplantation? We formulate this problem as a discrete-time, infinite-horizon Markov decision process model and solve it using clinical data. Because living donors are typically related to the recipient, we incorporate a disutility associated with using the living-donor liver as opposed to using a cadaveric liver. We perform a structural analysis of the model, including a set of intuitive conditions that ensure the existence of structured policies such as an at-most-three-region (AM3R) optimal policy. Our computational experiments confirm that the optimal policy is typically of AM3R type.

## 5. Template Use and the Effectiveness of Knowledge Transfer
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 3 Aug 2007
### Abstract:
This paper is a direct empirical examination of the fundamental claim that use of templates enhances the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. We explore the effect of template use through an eight-year, in-depth field investigation of Rank Xerox (now Xerox Europe). The field investigation covers three sequential transfer efforts in 15 western European countries. The investigation reveals a naturally occurring, repeated-treatment quasi experiment that allows us to test the hypothesis that the use of templates enhances the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Observations in this experiment measure the extent of adoption and performance of the practice at the recipient units. The treatment is the use of a template during the transfer.

## 6. Coherence and Consistency of Investors' Probability Judgments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
This study investigates the quality of direct probability judgments and quantile estimates with a focus on calibration and consistency. The two response modes use different measures of miscalibration, so it is difficult to directly compare their relative (in)accuracy. We employed a more refined within-subject design in which decision makers (DMs) used both response modes to make judgments about a random sample of stocks accompanied by identical information to facilitate comparison between the two judgment methods. DMs judged the probabilities that the stocks will reach a certain threshold, provided lower and upper bounds of these forecasts, and estimated median, 50%, 70%, and 90% confidence intervals of their future prices. We found that the judgments were internally consistent and coherent, but in most cases they were slightly miscalibrated. We used several new methods of analysis that allow for more precise and reliable comparison between the two response modes. We inferred point probability estimates for the target events from the confidence intervals and analyzed them by the same methods applied to binary judgments. Interestingly, when we quantified miscalibration in identical fashion for both methods we did not find evidence of differential levels of miscalibration for the probability judgments and the confidence intervals. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results.

## 7. Probability Elicitation, Scoring Rules, and Competition Among Forecasters
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
Probability forecasters who are rewarded via a proper scoring rule may care not only about the score, but also about their performance relative to other forecasters. We model this type of preference and show that a competitive forecaster who wants to do better than another forecaster typically should report more extreme probabilities, exaggerating toward zero or one. We consider a competitive forecaster's best response to truthful reporting and also investigate equilibrium reporting functions in the case where another forecaster also cares about relative performance. We show how a decision maker can revise probabilities of an event after receiving reported probabilities from competitive forecasters and note that the strategy of exaggerating probabilities can make well-calibrated forecasters (and a decision maker who takes their reported probabilities at face value) appear to be overconfident. However, a decision maker who adjusts appropriately for the misrepresentation of probabilities by one or more forecasters can still be well calibrated. Finally, to try to overcome the forecasters' competitive instincts and induce cooperative behavior, we develop the notion of joint scoring rules based on business sharing and show that these scoring rules are strictly proper.

## 8. Simulation of Coherent Risk Measures Based on Generalized Scenarios
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
In financial risk management, coherent risk measures have been proposed as a way to avoid undesirable properties of measures such as value at risk that discourage diversification and do not account for the magnitude of the largest, and therefore most serious, losses. A coherent risk measure equals the maximum expected loss under several different probability measures, and these measures are analogous to populations or systems in the ranking-and-selection literature. However, unlike in ranking and selection, here it is the value of the maximum expectation under any of the probability measures, and not the identity of the probability measure that attains it, that is of interest. We propose procedures to form fixed-width, simulation-based confidence intervals for the maximum of several expectations, explore their correctness and computational efficiency, and illustrate them on risk-management problems. The availability of efficient algorithms for computing coherent risk measures will encourage their use for improved risk management.

## 9. The Effects of Statistical Information on Risk and Ambiguity Attitudes, and on Rational Insurance Decisions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 7 Sep 2007
### Abstract:
This paper presents a field study into the effects of statistical information concerning risks on willingness to take insurance, with special attention being paid to the usefulness of these effects for the clients (the insured). Unlike many academic studies, we were able to use in-depth individual interviews of a large representative sample from the general public (N=476). The statistical information that had the most interesting effects, individual own past-cost information, unfortunately enhanced adverse selection, which we could directly verify because the real health costs of the clients were known. For a prescriptive evaluation this drawback must be weighted against some advantages: a desirable interaction with risk attitude, increased customer satisfaction, and increased cost awareness. Descriptively, ambiguity seeking was found rather than ambiguity aversion, and no risk aversion was found for loss outcomes. Both findings, obtained in a natural decision context, deviate from traditional views in risk theory but are in line with prospect theory. We confirmed prospect theory's reflection at the level of group averages but falsified it at the individual level.

## 10. Final-Offer Arbitration and Risk Aversion in Bargaining

### Abstract:
Negotiations are often conducted under the stipulation that an impasse is to be resolved using final-offer arbitration (FOA). In fact, FOA frequently is not needed; in Major League Baseball, for instance, more than 80% of the salary negotiations that could go to arbitration instead reach a bargained agreement. We show that the risk aversion of at least one side explains this phenomenon. We then model pay negotiation in baseball by applying a bargaining solution with a variable disagreement outcome representing FOA, studying the existence of pure Nash equilibrium initial offers and their effects on the player's eventual pay, and considering the Nash solution as a special case.

## 11. Convertible Bond Underpricing: Renegotiable Covenants, Seasoning, and Convergence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
We investigate the long-standing puzzle on the underpricings of convertible bonds. We hypothesize that the observed underpricing is induced by the possibility that a convertible bond might renegotiate on some of its covenants, e.g., an imbedded put option in financial difficulties. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the initial underpricing is larger for lower rated bonds. The underpricing worsens if the issuer experiences subsequent financial difficulties. However, conditional on no rating downgrades, our main empirical result shows that convertible bond prices do converge to their theoretical prices within two years. This seasoning period is shorter for higher rated convertible bonds.

## 12. Optimal Feature Advertising Design Under Competitive Clutter

### Abstract:
This study investigates consumers' attention to retail feature ads and proposes a method to optimize the design of the ads. Utilizing a large dataset of consumers' attention to over 1,100 individual feature ads collected with eye-tracking technology, we analyze the effects of the five key design elements of feature adsbrand, text, pictorial, price, and promotionon consumers' attention to them. Attention is measured in terms of selection and gaze duration. We focus on the effects of the surface sizes of the design elements. A key feature of our model is that it takes into account the impact of visual clutter in the ad display page. To capture the clutter effects, we propose two new entropy-based measures that characterize the salience of feature ads in their competitive environment based on Attention Engagement Theory. In a Bayesian framework, we simultaneously estimate the parameters of the model and optimize the design of feature ads in terms of surface sizes of the five design elements. Our optimization results and comparisons with alternative design approaches indicate that significant improvements in attention to feature advertising can be achieved without increase in costs, and that the resultant optimal feature ad designs create win-win opportunities for manufacturers and retailers.
