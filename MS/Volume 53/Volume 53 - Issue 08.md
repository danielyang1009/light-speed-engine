### Abstract:
We model and estimate the effects to downstream productivity from information technology (IT) investments made upstream. Specifically, we examine how an industrys productivity is affected by the IT capital stock of its suppliers. These supplier-driven IT spillovers occur because, due to competition in the supplying industry, quality benefits from suppliers IT investments can pass downstream. If the output deflators of supplying industries (consequently the intermediate input deflator of the using industries) do not capture the quality improvement from IT, then the output productivity of the supplying industries is mismeasured or misassigned. We develop and empirically test a model capturing these supplier-driven effects using data on 85 manufacturing industries at the three-digit SIC code level. We find that for a 10.5% increase in suppliers IT capital, the suppliers output increases by 0.63%0.70%, which is more than covering the cost of the increase in suppliers IT capital. In addition, this increase in suppliers IT capital increases the average downstream industrys output by $66$72 million, thereby confirming substantial supplier-driven IT spillovers downstream. We also infer the magnitude of the measurement error of the price deflator of the intermediate input resulting from the failure to account for IT-related quality improvement, finding that the measured price deflator overestimates the true deflator by approximately 30% at the mean level of IT capital.

## 3. The Impact of Prior Decisions on Subsequent Valuations in a Costly Contemplation Model

### Abstract:
This paper develops and tests a model of how recall of information from past decisions affects subsequent related decisions. A boundedly rational individual has to determine her willingness to pay for a good that she previously considered purchasing at a given price, or provide valuations for a set of goods that she previously ranked in order of preference. The individual is ex ante uncertain about her utility from consumption of the goods and can exert costly cognitive effort to reduce this uncertainty. We show that incorporating information from a prior decision has three primary effects: (a) Valuations are expected to exhibit higher variancein particular, the spread of valuations between the most and least preferred alternatives increases; (b) decision makers will, in expectation, exert more effort during the valuation phase; and (c) the relative impact of prior decisions on valuation spread increases, the more each attribute contributes to overall utility. The model predictions are then tested in a series of controlled lab experiments.

## 4. Effects of Information-Revelation Policies Under Market-Structure Uncertainty

### Abstract:
Geographically dispersed sellers in electronic reverse marketplaces such as those hosted by market-makers like Ariba are uncertain about the number of competitors they face in any given market session. We refer to this uncertainty about the number of competitors as market-structure uncertainty. Over the course of several market sessions sellers learn about the competitive nature of the marketplace. How they learn to reduce the market-structure uncertainty depends on the market-transparency scheme, or the revelation policy adopted. A revelation policy determines the extent to which informationthe number of sellers in a session, their bidding patterns, etc.is revealed to sellers. Because these policies control what sellers learn and how they bid in future sessions, they determine buyer surplus. Possibly because market-structure uncertainty is more prevalent in information technology-enabled marketplaces than traditional ones, prior work has not addressed the impact of revelation policies on this type of uncertainty. Currently, there is little guidance available to buyers in choosing the appropriate revelation policy.

## 5. The Price of Anarchy in Supply Chains: Quantifying the Efficiency of Price-Only Contracts
### Author(s):
- Georgia Perakis

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
In this paper, we quantify the efficiency of decentralized supply chains that use price-only contracts. With a price-only contract, a buyer and a seller agree only on a constant transaction price, without specifying the amount that will be transferred. It is well known that these contracts do not provide incentives to the parties to coordinate their inventory/capacity decisions. We measure efficiency with the price of anarchy (PoA), defined as the largest ratio of profits between the integrated supply chain (that is, fully coordinated) and the decentralized supply chain. We characterize the efficiency of various supply chain configurations: push or pull inventory positioning, two or more stages, serial or assembly systems, single or multiple competing suppliers, and single or multiple competing retailers.

## 6. Risk Mitigation in Newsvendor Networks: Resource Diversification, Flexibility, Sharing, and Hedging
### Author(s):
- Jan A. Van Mieghem
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2007
### Abstract:
This paper studies how judicious resource allocation in networks mitigates risk. Theory is presented for general utility functions and mean-variance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring resource diversification, flexibility (e.g., inventory substitution), and sharing (commonality). In contrast to single-resource settings, risk-averse newsvendors may invest more in networks than risk-neutral newsvendors: some resources and even total spending may exceed risk-neutral levels. With normally distributed demand, risk-averse newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand variance, while risk-neutral agents adjust only proportionally to standard deviation.

## 7. Existence of Coordinating Transshipment Prices in a Two-Location Inventory Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a two-location production/inventory model where each location makes production decisions and is subject to uncertain capacity. Each location optimizes its own profits. Transshipment (at a cost) is allowed from one location to another. We focus on the question of whether one can globally set a pair of coordinating transshipment prices, i.e., payments that each party has to make to the other for the transshipped goods, that induce the local decision makers to make inventory and transshipment decisions that are globally optimal. A recent paper suggests, for a special case of our model, that there always exists a unique pair of coordinating transshipment prices. We demonstrate through a counterexample that this statement is not correct and derive sufficient and necessary conditions under which it would hold. We show that in some conditions, coordinating prices may exist for only a narrow range of problem parameters and explore conditions when this can happen. Finally, we study the effects of demand and capacity variability on the magnitude of coordinating transshipment prices.

## 8. Fairness and Channel Coordination
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
We incorporate the concept of fairness in a conventional dyadic channel to investigate how fairness may affect channel coordination. We show that when channel members are concerned about fairness, the manufacturer can use a simple wholesale price above her marginal cost to coordinate this channel both in terms of achieving the maximum channel profit and in terms of attaining the maximum channel utility. Thus, channel coordination may not require an elaborate pricing contract. A constant wholesale price will do.

## 9. Learning from Experience in Software Development: A Multilevel Analysis

### Published:

### Abstract:
This study examines whether individuals, groups, and organizational units learn from experience in software development and whether this learning improves productivity. Although prior research has found the existence of learning curves in manufacturing and service industries, it is not clear whether learning curves also apply to knowledge work like software development. We evaluate the relative productivity impacts from accumulating specialized experience in a system, diversified experience in related and unrelated systems, and experience from working with others on modification requests (MRs) in a telecommunications firm, which uses an incremental software development methodology. Using multilevel modeling, we analyze extensive data archives covering more than 14 years of systems development work on a major telecommunications product dating from the beginning of its development process. Our findings reveal that the relative importance of the different types of experience differs across levels of analysis. Specialized experience has the greatest impact on productivity for MRs completed by individual developers, whereas diverse experience in related systems plays a larger role in improving productivity for MRs and system releases completed by groups and organizational units. Diverse experience in unrelated systems has the least influence on productivity at all three levels of analysis. Our findings support the existence of learning curves in software development and provide insights into when specialized or diverse experience may be more valuable.

## 10. Does Transaction Misalignment Matter for Firm Survival at All Stages of the Industry Life Cycle?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
Research on industry life cycles suggests that competitive pressures are more severe during the shakeout stage, which could be associated with the emergence of a dominant design, than at other stages. Transaction-cost theory, on the other hand, assumes generally competitive markets and does not address the industry life cycle. It therefore implies that transaction-cost economizing is a superior firm strategy regardless of the stage of the life cycle. This paper seeks to reconcile these two streams of research by investigating whether aligning transactions with governance modes in accordance with transaction-cost prescriptions has a differential effect on firm survival in preshakeout versus shakeout stages of the industry life cycle. Analyzing data from the early U.S. auto industry (19171933), we find that while transaction misalignment did not have a significant impact on firm survival during the preshakeout stage or during the period as a whole, it did have a significantly larger negative impact on survival during the shakeout stage than during the preshakeout stage. We also find that the negative effects of misalignment on survival were significantly weaker for larger firms during the shakeout stage. This suggests that applications of transaction-cost theory which assume uniformly severe selection pressures across the industry life cycle and uniform effects of misalignment across firms of different sizes could be misleading. It also suggests that theories of the industry life cycle could usefully take transaction costs into account along with production costs in their analyses of competition over the life cycle.

## 11. A Market-Based Optimization Algorithm for Distributed Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Jul 2007
### Abstract:
In this paper, a market-based decomposition method for decomposable linear systems is developed. The solution process iterates between a master problem that solves the market-matching problem, and subproblems that solve the agents bundle-determination problems. Starting from any initial price and feasible allocation, system optimality can be achieved under a dynamic market-trading algorithm in a finite number of trades. The final market-clearing prices are discovered by this market trading and an efficient allocation is achieved by direct, wealth-improving resource exchanges among self-interested agents. Certain types of strategic behavior by the agents and a dealer in the marketplace are studied as well. Our proposed market mechanism addresses price dynamics, incentive issues, and economic transactions of real-world, distributed decision-making situations more realistically than traditional decomposition approaches. In addition, it can be operated in both synchronous and asynchronous environments. We provide a market-based paradigm for decentralized problem solving and information processing that can be easily implemented to support real-time optimization of distributed systems.
