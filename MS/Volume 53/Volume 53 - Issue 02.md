### Abstract:
This paper presents new evidence regarding a firms probability for survival, based on the network structure of the firms managers. We found that start-ups that have larger informal communication networks increased their chance to survive external shock. Original data have been collected from Israeli software start-ups during the dot-com economic growth. About eight years later, we added information about their ability to survive the burst of the dot-com bubble. From a theoretical point of view, this paper highlights the power of the classic social networks approach in explaining organizational performance. From a practical point of view, these findings offer some guidelines for managers of start-ups. Our results show that the size of informal interfirm networks really matters.

### Abstract:
Modularity in product design and flexible supply chains is increasingly common in buyersupplier relationships. Although the benefits of supply chain flexibility and component modularity for end-product manufacturers are accepted, little is known about their impact on suppliers. We advance the literature on modularity by exploring how three aspects of a suppliers relationships with its customers affect the suppliers survival: duration of buyersupplier relationships, autonomy from customers, and links to prominent buyers. We compared the effects of these aspects of buyersupplier relationships for low- and high-modularity components. Using data on U.S. carburetor and clutch manufacturers from 1918 to 1942, we found that suppliers of high-modularity components benefited more from autonomy provided by potential customers, whereas suppliers of low-modularity components benefited more from ties to higher status customers. Both benefited from autonomy generated by existing customers. Thus, relationships that require trust and extensive sets of interfirm routines, as do those for low-modularity components, led to both greater relationship benefits and greater constraints.

- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
This paper studies the impact of competition on a firms choice of technology (product-flexible or product-dedicated) and capacity investment decisions. Specifically, we model two firms competing with each other in two markets characterized by price-dependent and uncertain demand. The firms make three decisions in the following sequence: choice of technology (technology game), capacity investment (capacity game), and production quantities (production game). The technology and capacity games occur while the demand curve is still uncertain, and the production game is postponed until after the demand curve is revealed.

## 5. Strategic IT Investments: The Impact of Switching Cost and Declining IT Cost

### Abstract:
The declining cost of information technology (IT) over time provides the later entrant in information-intensive industries a cost advantage. On the other hand, the earlier entrant has the potential to build and retain its market share if consumers incur a cost in switching to the later entrant. We investigate the impact of a decline in the IT cost and the switching cost on IT investment strategies of firms. We find that a declining IT cost always hurts the early entrants profit. The early entrant may assume an aggressive investment strategy or a defensive investment strategy in response to a decline in the IT cost, depending on whether the switching cost relative to the extent of decline in the IT cost is high or low, respectively. A decline in IT cost also hurts the later entrants profit if the switching cost is high. A surprising result is that when the decline in the IT cost is higher than a critical value, a higher switching cost increases consumer surplus. When firms control the switching cost, the early entrant increases its investment in quality and switching cost and maintains its quality and its market-share leadership irrespective of the extent of decline in the IT cost.

## 6. Asymmetric Consumer Learning and Inventory Competition

### Abstract:
We develop a model of consumer learning and choice behavior in response to uncertain service in the marketplace. Learning could be asymmetric, that is, consumers may associate different weights with positive and negative experiences. Under this consumer model, we characterize the steady-state distribution of demand for retailers given that each retailer holds a constant in-stock service level. We then consider a noncooperative game in steady state between two retailers competing on the basis of their service levels. The demand distributions of retailers in this game are modeled using a multiplicative aggregate market-share model in which the mean demands are obtained from the steady-state results for individual purchases, but the model is simplified in other respects for tractability. Our model yields a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that asymmetry in consumer learning has a significant impact on the optimal service levels, market shares, and profits of the retailers. When retailers have different costs, it also determines the extent of competitive advantage enjoyed by the lower-cost retailer.

## 7. Outsourcing via Service Competition

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a single buyer who wishes to outsource a fixed demand for a manufactured good or service at a fixed price to a set of potential suppliers. We examine the value of competition as a mechanism for the buyer to elicit service quality from the suppliers. We compare two approaches the buyer could use to orchestrate this competition: (1) a supplier-allocation (SA) approach, which allocates a proportion of demand to each supplier with the proportion allocated to a supplier increasing in the quality of service the supplier promises to offer, and (2) a supplier-selection (SS) approach, which allocates all demand to one supplier with the probability that a particular supplier is selected increasing in the quality of service to which the supplier commits. In both cases, suppliers incur a cost whenever they receive a positive portion of demand, with this cost increasing in the quality of service they offer and the demand they receive. The analysis reveals that (a) a buyer could indeed orchestrate a competition among potential suppliers to promote service quality, (b) under identical allocation functions, the existence of a demand-independent service cost gives a distinct advantage to SS-type competitions, in terms of higher service quality for the buyer and higher expected profit for the supplier, (c) the relative advantage of SS versus SA depends on the magnitude of demand-independent versus demand-dependent service costs, (d) in the presence of a demand-independent service cost, a buyer should limit the number of competing suppliers under SA competition but impose no such limits under SS competition, and (e) a buyer can induce suppliers to provide higher service levels by selecting an appropriate allocation function. We illustrate the impact of these results through three example applications.

## 8. Testing a Life-Cycle Theory of Cooperative Interorganizational Relationships: Movement Across Stages and Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
This research examines the evolution of cooperative interorganizational relationships and provides an empirical test of four propositions from the DSO (Dwyer et al. 1987) life-cycle theory, and one proposition from the RV (Ring and Van de Ven 1994) theory of relationship development. Using primary data from over 1,500 resellers in a channel of distribution, we find that the mature phase is not the pinnacle of the relationship lifecycle; relationship properties (e.g., relationship harmony, overall dependence, and the resellers trust in the manufacturer) in this stage are no different than in the build-up phase. However, relationship properties that support relationship expansion (e.g., goal congruence and information exchange norms) reach their zenith in the build-up phase and afterwards fade into the background. All of the various relationship properties hit their nadir in the decline phase.

## 9. Dynamic Assortment with Demand Learning for Seasonal Consumer Goods
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
Companies such as Zara and World Co. have recently implemented novel product development processes and supply chain architectures enabling them to make more product design and assortment decisions during the selling season, when actual demand information becomes available. How should such retail firms modify their product assortment over time in order to maximize overall profits for a given selling season? Focusing on a stylized version of this problem, we study a finite horizon multiarmed bandit model with several plays per stage and Bayesian learning. Our analysis involves the Lagrangian relaxation of weakly coupled dynamic programs (DPs), results contributing to the emerging theory of DP duality, and various approximations. It yields a closed-form dynamic index policy capturing the key exploration versus exploitation trade-off and associated suboptimality bounds. In numerical experiments its performance proves comparable to that of other closed-form heuristics described in the literature, but this policy is particularly easy to implement and interpret. This last feature enables extensions to more realistic versions of the motivating dynamic assortment problem that include implementation delays, switching costs, and demand substitution effects.

## 10. Coordinated Replenishment Strategies in Inventory/Distribution Systems

- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the impact of coordinated replenishment and shipment in inventory/distribution systems. We analyze a system with multiple retailers and one outside supplier. Random demand occurs at each retailer, and the supplier replenishes all the retailers. In traditional inventory models, each retailer orders directly from the supplier whenever the need arises. We present a new, centralized ordering policy that orders for all retailers simultaneously. The new policy is equivalent to the introduction of a warehouse with no inventory that is in charge of the ordering, allocation, and distribution of inventory to the retailers. Under such a policy, orders for some retailers may be postponed or expedited so that they can be batched with other retailers orders, which results in savings in ordering and shipping costs. In addition to the policy we propose for supplying inventory to the retailers, we also consider three other policies that are based on these well-known policies in the literature: (a) can-order policy, (b) echelon inventory policy, and (c) fixed-replenishment interval policy. Furthermore, we create a framework for simultaneously making inventory and transportation decisions by incorporating the transportation costs (or limited truck capacities). We numerically compare the performance of our proposed policy with these policies to identify the settings in which each policy would perform well.

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a finite-state, finite-action, infinite-horizon, discounted reward Markov decision process and study the bias and variance in the value function estimates that result from empirical estimates of the model parameters. We provide closed-form approximations for the bias and variance, which can then be used to derive confidence intervals around the value function estimates. We illustrate and validate our findings using a large database describing the transaction and mailing histories for customers of a mail-order catalog firm.

## 12. An Extreme Value Approach to Estimating Interest-Rate Volatility: Pricing Implications for Interest-Rate Options
### Author(s):
- Turan G. Bali
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
This paper proposes an extreme value approach to estimating interest-rate volatility, and shows that during the extreme movements of the U.S. Treasury market the volatility of interest-rate changes is underestimated by the standard approach that uses the thin-tailed normal distribution. The empirical results indicate that (1) the volatility of maximal and minimal changes in interest rates declines as time-to-maturity rises, yielding a downward-sloping volatility curve for the extremes; (2) the minimal changes are more volatile than the maximal changes for all data sets and for all asymptotic distributions used; (3) the minimal changes in Treasury yields have fatter tails than the maximal changes; and (4) for both the maxima and minima, the extreme changes in short-term rates have thicker tails than the extreme changes in long-term rates. This paper extends the standard option-pricing models with lognormal forward rates to accommodate significant kurtosis observed in the interest-rate data. This paper introduces a closed-form option-pricing model based on the generalized extreme value distribution that successfully removes the well-known pricing bias of the lognormal distribution.

## 13. Capturing Flexible Heterogeneous Utility Curves: A Bayesian Spline Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2007
### Abstract:
Empirical evidence suggests that decision makers often weight successive additional units of a valued attribute or monetary endowment unequally, so that their utility functions are intrinsically nonlinear or irregularly shaped. Although the analyst may impose various functional specifications exogenously, this approach is ad hoc, tedious, and reliant on various metrics to decide which specification is best. In this paper, we develop a method that yields individual-level, flexibly shaped utility functions for use in choice models. This flexibility at the individual level is accomplished through splines of the truncated power basis type in a general additive regression framework for latent utility. Because the number and location of spline knots are unknown, we use the birth-death process of Denison et al. (1998) and Greens (1995) reversible jump method. We further show how exogenous constraints suggested by theory, such as monotonicity of price response, can be accommodated. Our formulation is particularly suited to estimating reaction to pricing, where individual-level monotonicity is justified theoretically and empirically, but linearity is typically not. The method is illustrated in a conjoint application in which all covariates are splined simultaneously and in three panel data sets, each of which has a single price spline. Empirical results indicate that piecewise linear splines with a modest number of knots fit these data well, substantially better than heterogeneous linear and log-linear a priori specifications. In terms of price response specifically, we find that although aggregate market-level curves can be nearly linear or log-linear, individuals often deviate widely from either. Using splines, hold-out prediction improvement over the standard heterogeneous probit model ranges from 6% to 14% in the scanner applications and exceeds 20% in the conjoint study. Moreover, optimal profiles in conjoint and aggregate price response curves in the scanner applications can differ markedly under the standard and the spline-based models.
