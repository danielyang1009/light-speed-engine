## 2. Minimum-Cost Checking Using Imperfect Information
### Author(s):
- Stephen M. Pollock
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
An event takes place at time t, a discrete random variable with known probability function. At unit intervals of time, a measurement x is observed which yields information about the event; x is a random variable, with a known probability density function being dependent upon whether or not the event has yet occurred.

## 3. The Queue M/G/1 With Feedback to Lower Priority Queues
### Author(s):
- L. E. Schrage
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
The queue M/G/1 with a round-robin type queueing discipline is considered. The overall processing time of a job is assumed to consist of a sequence of “simple” processing times. There are a countably infinite number of waiting queues, 1,2,…, but a single processing facility. A job upon arrival enters the first, or highest priority waiting queue. When a job in the nth queue gains the processor, it receives its nth simple processing time in an uninterrupted fashion and then either departs or enters the n + 1st queue. The processor upon completion of a simple processing time selects the job to be next processed from the highest priority (lowest index number) non-empty queue. Laplace transforms and expressions for the moments of the time in system distributions are obtained.

## 4. Optimality and Computation of (σ, S) Policies in the Multi-Item Infinite Horizon Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Ellis L. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
A multi-item inventory system with periodic review, single set-up cost K plus linear ordering cost c for changing stock levels, and holding and shortage cost l(x) for being in stock position x at the beginning of a period is considered. Demand in any period is assumed to be ξ with probability ϕ(x,ξ), where x is the stock level at the beginning of the period. The infinite horizon optimum policies found consist of ordering up to S for any point x in σ, the reorder region, and not ordering at x not in σ. A computational procedure is given, bounds are derived, and, for further assumptions on l, σ is further characterized.

## 5. On Nonlinear Fractional Programming
### Author(s):
- Werner Dinkelbach
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
The main purpose of this paper is to delineate an algorithm for fractional programming with nonlinear as well as linear terms in the numerator and denominator. The algorithm presented is based on a theorem by Jagannathan (Jagannathan, R. 1966. On some properties of programming problems in parametric form pertaining to fractional programming. Management Sci.12 609–615.) concerning the relationship between fractional and parametric programming. This theorem is restated and proved in a somewhat simpler way. Finally, it is shown how the given algorithm can be related to the method of Isbell and Marlow (Isbell, J. R., W. H. Marlow. 1956. Attrition games. Naval Res. Logist. Quart.3 71–93.) for linear fractional programming and to the quadratic parametric approach by Ritter (Ritter, K. 1962. Ein Verfahren zur Lösung parameterabhängiger, nichtlinearer Maximum- Probleme. Unternehmensforschung, Band 6, S. 149–166.). The Appendix contains a numerical example.

## 6. A Linear Programming Algorithm for Mutual Fund Portfolio Selection
### Author(s):
- William F. Sharpe
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
The portfolio selection problem faced by a mutual fund manager can be formulated following the Markowitz approach: find those portfolios that are efficient in terms of predicted expected return and standard deviation of return, subject to legal constraints in the form of upper bounds on the proportion of the fund invested in any single security. This paper suggests that such problems be re-formulated as parametric linear-programming problems, utilizing a linear approximation to the true (quadratic) formula for a portfolio's risk. Limited empirical evidence suggests that the approximation is acceptable. Moreover, it allows the use of an extremely simple and efficient special-purpose solution algorithm. With appropriate modifications, this algorithm may prove useful to the managers of mutual funds with a wide variety of objectives.

## 7. Optimal Timing of Bond Refunding
### Author(s):
- H. Martin Weingartner
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
Refunding is the operation by which the issuer of a bond calls it before maturity in order to replace it with another issue. The chief reason for calling is the interest saving which a new bond may make possible. In deciding whether to call a bond at any given time, the issuer must consider not only the potential savings from the current refunding, but also from future refundings up to some horizon fixed by financial policy. These savings must also be compared with those resulting from the decision to postpone refunding. This paper formulates the refunding problem in terms of a dynamic programming model in which the term structure of interest rates is utilized to obtain information about the future course of interest rates.

## 8. The Analysis of Simulation-Generated Time Series
### Author(s):
- George S. Fishman
- Philip J. Kiviat
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
This study applies spectral analysis to the study of time series data generated by simulated stochastic models. Because these data are autocorrelated, analysis by methods applicable to independent observations is not possible. Mathematical models known as covariance stationary stochastic processes are useful representations of autocorrelated time series. The increased publication of literature describing stochastic processes and spectral analysis, in particular, is making these ideas available to an increasing audience.

## 9. On The Application of the Laplace Transform to Certain Economic Problems
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Grubbström
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
During the last thirty years, the method of the Laplace transform has found an increasing number of applications in the fields of physics and technology. In this article the author points out the possibility of solving problems in the area of discounting with the aid of this method. Without any loss of general validity, it is shown that a discount factor can always be written in an exponential manner which implies that the present value of a cash-flow will obtain a very simple form in the Laplace terminology. This simplicity holds good for stochastic as well as for deterministic economic processes, and the results mentioned below should, therefore, be of immediate use when applied, e.g., to investment problems.

## 10. Mathematical Model for a Duopolistic Market
### Author(s):
- K. S. Krishnan
- Shiv K. Gupta
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is developed for a marketing situation with two competitors when each competitor has two control variables, viz. price and promotional effort. The model discussed in this paper is an extension of Mills' model [Bass, Frank M., Buzzell, Robert D., Greene, Mark R., Lazer, William, Pessemier, Edgar A., Shawver, Donald L., Shuchman, Abraham, Theodore, Chris A., Wilson, George W. Mathematical Models and Methods in Marketing, article by Harland D. Mills, “A Study of Promotional Competition,” pp. 271–301, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., Homewood, Illinois, 1961.]. Mills has assumed that each competitor has only one control variable, viz. promotional effort and the profit margins of the two competitors are known. In this paper the profit margins are also control variables. The paper derives conditions under which non-boundary equilibrium solutions exist and the sensitivity of the model for small deviations in the decision variables from their equilibrium values is tested. Mills' results are found to be valid only under certain conditions.

## 11. A Bayesian Approach to an Individual Player's Choice of Bid in Competitive Sealed Auctions
### Author(s):
- Irving H. Lavalle
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
A general approach to the decision problem confronting the individual player in a noncooperative game is outlined and applied to one player's choice of bid in a competitive sealed auction for a valuable object. That player's Bayes-optimal bid is characterized under both general and specific assumptions as to the subjective probability distributions expressing his judgments. Under the specific assumptions, analytically tractable results (in terms of Gamma fractiles) are presented. Equilibrium and maximin bids are presented for comparative purposes.

## 12. Communications to the Editor—Probability and Rates of Return: Some Critical Comments
### Author(s):
- Richard H. Bernhard
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1967
### Abstract:
A recent issue of this journal presents a paper by Professor F. S. Hillier [Hillier, F. S. 1963. The derivation of probabilistic information for the evaluation of risky investments. Management Sci.9(3, April) 443–457.] in which he develops, under limiting but carefully, stated assumptions, a formal analytic procedure for finding the parameters of a probability distribution of present worth given a known interest rate and probabilistic information about the sequence of cash flows to be discounted. It is the intent of this communication to question the utility of distributions of the internal rate of return given that they have been found.
