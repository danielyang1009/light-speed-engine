## 1. Optimal Level Debt Schedules for Municipal Bonds
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
An important restriction which frequently appears in the bid specifications for new issues of municipal bonds is that the total dollar amount to be paid for both principal and interest by the municipality in any given year of the issue must not be significantly different from the total dollar amount to be paid in any other year, i.e., that the total payout pattern over the lifetime of the bond issue must be substantially level. Because of this “level debt” restriction, the inter-relationships between coupon schedule and maturity schedule appear to underwriters as being very complex. Given the requirements of the marketplace, bond market professionals presently employ trial-and-error techniques in an attempt to determine the admissible coupon and maturity schedule which will lead to the lowest possible net interest cost. The present paper shows that the determination of this optimal coupon and maturity schedule for a level debt issue can be readily accomplished by linear programming techniques.

## 2. Heuristics in Job Shop Scheduling
### Author(s):
- William S. Gere, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
The problem is that of scheduling jobs with diverse routings on the productive facilities in a shop such that the respective due dates are met, or failing this, the sum of lateness times is minimized. The approach is simulative in that the operation of the shop is simulated in a Fortran program, but in addition to the straightforward use of priority rules for determining sequences of jobs on the machines, a number of heuristics or rules of thumb are incorporated. Both the static and dynamic problems are investigated. The efficacy of a small number of heuristics in combination with certain priority rules is demonstrated.

## 3. Production Smoothing of Economic Lot Sizes with Non-Decreasing Requirements
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of finding a production schedule, in terms of how much to produce in each period, that minimizes the total cost of supplying known market requirements for a single product. The costs include a concave production cost, a concave inventory cost, and a piecewise concave cost of changing the production level from one period to the next. Assuming that there is no backlogging of requirements and that the market requirements are monotone increasing, i.e., not decreasing from period to period, the form of the minimum cost production schedule is obtained. This form is then exploited in a dynamic programming algorithm to provide an efficient means of exactly determining the minimum cost schedule. An interesting calculation reducing theorem is also developed to further enhance the efficiency of the dynamic programming algorithm.

## 4. Discrete Optimization Via Marginal Analysis
### Author(s):
- Bennett Fox
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
Discrete optimization subject to one constraint is attacked by Lagrangian analysis. Incremental allocation schemes are given that generate undominated allocations. In an important special case, the complete family of undominated allocations is generated.

## 5. Some Aspects of the Effects of the Regional Distribution of Scientific Talent on Regional Economic Activity
### Author(s):
- Ira Horowitz
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
There is a persistent belief that regional R and D activity will have stimulating effects on the region's economic activity. In order to explore this view further, a multi-equation econometric model is derived to determine the extent to which the spatial distribution of scientific talent is in turn reflected in regional economic activity. The parameters of the model are estimated by the two-stage least-squares method. It is concluded that such economic variables as investment in plant and equipment, employment, and earnings are positively related to the distribution of scientific talent, although these relationships are relatively inelastic. It is also seen that the regional distribution of Department of Defense R and D expenditures tends to be extremely elastic with respect to the regional distribution of scientific talent. It is therefore concluded that concern for the scientific sophistication of a region's population, and the economic implications of this sophistication, is by no means misplaced.

## 6. The Efficient Use of an Imperfect Forecast
### Author(s):
- Howard E. Thompson
- William Beranek
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
This paper illustrates how individual forecasts and forecasting techniques may be evaluated by the use of established decision theory. Given the probability distribution of the forecast error, we first find the optimal strategy for a decision process, i.e., how to make the most efficient use of a forecast. After expressing the expected profit of the optimal strategies in terms of the probability of a correct forecast, we illustrate how to find (1) the value of an imperfect forecast, and (2) the value of a forecasting technique. With this information, we can then determine when to use a forecast, the maximum amount to pay for both a forecast and a forecasting method, and the conditions under which it is worthwhile to attempt to improve the accuracy of a forecasting method.

## 7. Strictly Concave Parametric Programming, Part I: Basic Theory
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
This paper, which is presented in two parts, develops a computational approach to strictly concave parametric programs of the form: Maximize α f1(x) + (1 − α)f2(x) subject to concave inequality constraints for each fixed value of α in the unit interval, where f1 and f2 are strictly concave and certain additional regularity conditions are satisfied. This class of problems subsumes a corresponding class of vector maximum problems and also, by means of a simple device, provides a deformation method for ordinary concave programming. The approach is based on exploiting the continuity properties of the parametric program so as to efficiently maintain a solution to the associated Kuhn-Tucker conditions as a traverses the unit interval. The same approach can be adapted to much more general parametric programs than the one above.

## 8. Generalized Cuts in Diophantine Programming
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
In the generation of an additional constraint or cut for integer programming introduced by Ralph Gomory, there is a certain parameter whose value is customarily chosen so that one of the original variables has a zero coefficient in the cut-equation. In this paper we consider alternative values of the parameter and refer to any linear combination of the original source equation and this cut as a “generalised cut”. Attention is then focused, as customary, on those cuts of this type for which the original variable has a zero coefficient. In particular, we show how to determine values for Gomory's parameter so that only a subset of the feasible solutions to the cuts used by Gomory's method of integer forms are feasible for the generalised cuts.

## 9. An Engineering Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem
### Author(s):
- S. M. Roberts
- Benito Flores
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
An engineering approach to the traveling salesman problem is a method which is intuitively “reasonable” to the non-mathematician. It consists of a sequence of operations which (1) develops good starting circuits, (2) improves these circuits, (3) extracts sufficient information from the improved circuits to determine pairs or chains of cities likely to appear in the conjectured global minimum cost circuit, (4) with certain cities paired off, develops the graph of the network. The graph program generates all the circuits from the smallest to the largest cost. The method has been applied successfully to the 20, 48, and 57 city traveling salesman problems.

## 10. Communications to the Editor—An Analysis of Criteria for Investment and Financing Decisions Under Certainty: A Comment
### Author(s):
- James C. T. Mao
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
In a recent article [Teichroew, D., A. A. Robichek, M. Montalbano. 1965. An analysis of criteria for investment and financing decisions under certainty. Management Sci.12(3, November) 151–179.] in this Journal, Daniel Teichroew, Alexander A. Robichek, and Michael Montalbano (TRM) investigated the decision-making procedures for accepting or rejecting investment alternatives available to the firm. There are, however, certain key ideas in their article which need either further clarification or simple modification. It is hoped that by suggesting these clarifications and modifications, this note will make more clear the full value of TRM's basic contributions.

## 11. Note on Level-Debt-Service Municipal Bidding
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1966
### Abstract:
Cohen and Hammer [Cohen, K. J., F. S. Hammer. 1966. Optimal level debt schedules for municipal bonds. Management Sci.13(3, November).] have shown that under certain conditions the problem of selecting a coupon-principal schedule, when bidding on a new issue of municipal bonds with a level-debt-service constraint, is a linear programming problem. A similar result was independently obtained by the present author, and is presented here, using the same definitions and notations as in Cohen and Hammer.
