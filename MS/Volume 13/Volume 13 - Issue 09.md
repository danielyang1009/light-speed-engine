## 1. A Markovian Decision Model for a Joint Replacement and Stocking Problem
### Author(s):
- C. Derman
- G. J. Lieberman
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
Two important classes of problems encountered by industry and government are those dealing with replacement policies and ordering policies. These problems are usually treated separately. A particular model which treats the replacement and stocking problems as one is considered in this paper. It is formulated as a denumerable state Markovian decision model. It is shown that the optimal decision policy has a particular structure. In attaining the optimal policy, this structure is exploited so that an optimal policy can be obtained in a finite number of steps.

## 2. A Finite Horizon Dynamic Inventory Model with a Stockout Constraint
### Author(s):
- Paul R. Beesack
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
A finite horizon, periodic review, dynamic inventory model for a single item with a stockout constraint is considered in this paper, and the optimal ordering policy is obtained. The discrete case is dealt with, and linear purchase and holding costs are assumed together with a fixed order cost, all costs being discounted back to the beginning of the first period. A fixed delivery lead time is assumed, and backlogging of unsatisfied demand is required. The stockout constraint is that the ratio of the expected number of stockouts to the expected demand over the finite horizon not exceed a preassigned fraction. The optimal ordering policy is obtained by the usual dynamic programming technique, using a Lagrange multiplier to handle the stockout constraint.

## 3. Transient Behaviour of a Tandem Queue
### Author(s):
- N. U. Prabhu
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
Customers arrive in a Poisson process at a queueing system with two counters in series, with an infinite queue allowed before the first counter and no queue allowed before the second. The steady-state behaviour of this system was studied by earlier authors. In this paper the transient behaviour of the stochastic processes underlying the model is investigated.

## 4. A Stochastic Inventory Model for Rented Equipment
### Author(s):
- William D. Whisler
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
An inventory of rented equipment is studied. Equipment is withdrawn from the inventory by customers who use it for a length of time and then return it. Decisions about the amount of equipment to rent can be made at certain points in time. This paper describes a policy for making these decisions which minimizes expected costs. The dynamic programming model formulated is different than the usual ones considered in the literature because the inventory level can fluctuate up or down and convexity of the cost function is not important since simple optimal policies can be found when the cost function is nonconvex.

## 5. Labor and Machine Limited Production Systems
### Author(s):
- Rosser T. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
A number of investigations have been performed with models of machine limited production systems. In the main, the work has centered upon evaluation of alternative queue disciplines. In this paper, a model is proposed for studying systems in which both machines and labor are limiting resources. The proposed model includes several design and control factors which offer promising subjects for research. These factors relate to labor and job assignment procedures and control, labor force training, and system flexibility as determined by equipment purchasing and employment policies. Results are reported for an initial set of experiments in which the labor assignment procedure and the size of the labor force are variables, and for two subsequent sets of experiments in which the labor assignment procedure, the degree of centralized control of labor assignment, the job routing characteristics of the network, and the labor efficiency matrix are variables. Suggestions are given for further research.

## 6. Stochastic Programming with Aspiration or Fractile Criteria
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
The general linear programming problem is considered in which the coefficients of the objective function to be maximized are assumed to be random variables with a known multinormal distribution. Three deterministic reformulations involve, respectively, maximizing the expected value, the α-fractile (α fixed, 0 < α < ½), and the probability of exceeding a predetermined level k of payoff. In this paper the author's previous work on “bi-criterion programs” is specialized to give an algorithm for routinely and efficiently solving the second and third reformulations. A by-product of the calculations in each case is the tradeoff-curve between the criterion being maximized and expected value. The intimate relationships between all three reformulations are illuminated, with the cumulative effect of considerably lessening the burden on the decision-maker to preselect with finality a particular value of α or k.

## 7. A New Model for Stochastic Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- William H. Evers
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
The linear programming formulation with random variation in the coefficient matrix is considered. A new model is proposed in which the random variation in the constraints is removed and terms dependent upon the distributions associated with the random constraints introduced into the objective function. The new objective function may be interpreted quite naturally as the sum of the original costs, the expected shortage (or overage) and the set-up cost.

## 8. Car Pool Systems in Railroad Transportation: Mathematical Models
### Author(s):
- B. Avi-Itzhak
- B. A. Benn
- B. A. Powell
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
A car pool system is a closed transportation system where a number of care are assigned to ship goods from one source to any number of destinations. Such systems are common to all modes of transportation (surface, marine and air). In this paper descriptive mathematical models are developed for car pools in railroad transportation. The models resemble inventory models and are also applicable to similar systems in other modes of transportation.

## 9. Extensions of Amoroso-Robinson's Formula
### Author(s):
- Ernst Lykke Jensen
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of price-fixing from the standpoint of an individual firm in a heterogeneous market. The elementary Amoroso-Robinson formula is generalized within a deterministic as well as a probabilistic set-up. In the probabilistic case it is shown that the price-solution depends on the standard deviation of demand as a function of the price parameters. From the models considered it is, in particular, deduced that the optimum price is at a lower level than the corresponding deterministic price if the standard deviation is constant, but at a higher level if the coefficient of variation is constant.

## 10. A Branch and Bound Algorithm for the Knapsack Problem
### Author(s):
- Peter J. Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
A branch and bound algorithm for solution of the “knapsack problem,” max ∑ vixi where ∑ wixi ≦ W and xi = 0, 1, is presented which can obtain either optimal or approximate solutions. Some characteristics of the algorithm are discussed and computational experience is presented. Problems involving 50 items from which approximately 25 items were loaded were solved in an average of 0.07 minutes each by a coded version of this algorithm for the IBM 7094 computer.

## 11. Computational Experience with Variants of the Balas Algorithm Applied to the Selection of R&D Projects
### Author(s):
- Clifford C. Petersen
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
Allocating funds to independent R&D projects is a problem of practical importance for many firms. We formulate the problem as a 0-1 integer programming problem with the objective of selecting projects that will maximize the anticipated dollar contract volume, yet not exceed cost budgets. Our form-mulation accommodates R&D projects extending over several budget periods and permits carryover of unspent funds from one budget period to later periods. Experience in solving such problems by using the Balas [Balas, Egon. 1965. An additive algorithm for solving linear programs with zero-one variables. Oper. Res.13 (4, July–August) 517–549.] algorithm in its literal form and in reformulated form is summarized. Several other modifications to the algorithm are described and; their effect on efficiency is shown through presentation of computational experience on problems with as many as 50 variables.

## 12. Optimum Production Planning by the Maximum Principle
### Author(s):
- C. L. Hwang
- L. T. Fan
- L. E. Erickson
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
This study deals with the problem of optimum production planning with certainty in sales forecasting. The objective to be minimized is the sum of the costs derived from holding inventories, stockouts, and the deviation of the production rate from the optimal rate for the plant. Pontryagin's maximum principle is employed to obtain an optimal production policy.

## 13. A Pareto-Optimal Dividend Policy
### Author(s):
- Robert Wilson
### Published:
- 1 May 1967
### Abstract:
A Pareto-optimal sequential dividend policy for a syndicate is obtained in a tractable special case. The relationship between the many-person and single-person problems is investigated, and it is shown that the group acts as though it were an individual with risk preferences and probability assessments compounded from the members according to explicit formulae.

### Abstract:
This note describes a 5-person von Neumann-Morgenstern game which has a unique solution that is strictly larger than its core. This game provides a counterexample for the following two conjectures stated by L. S. Shapley in [Kuhn, H. W., ed. Report of an Informal Conference on the Theory of n-Person Games, held at Princeton University, March 20–21, 1953 (dittoed).].
