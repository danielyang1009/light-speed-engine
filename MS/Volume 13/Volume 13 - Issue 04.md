## 1. Planning Models
### Author(s):
- Martin K. Starr
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
At present, the term planning has many meanings and little substance. It is an omnibus word or a dressing gown under which a variety of management matters masquerade. So many management activities are described as planning that the significance of the term may have succumbed to generality.

## 2. Models and Modelling for Manpower Planning
### Author(s):
- W. R. Dill
- D. P. Gaver
- W. L. Weber
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
Some parts of the long-range planning problem have been widely discussed. Other parts have received less attention. Of the relatively neglected areas, one of special importance is manpower planning. Manpower planning includes a specification of the kinds and numbers of men an organization will need to accomplish its profit, growth, or service objectives; a forecast from current personnel inventories of how well it is now set to meet the projected needs; and by a comparison of needs with forecasted supply, the formulation of plans for recruiting, assigning, and developing personnel.

## 3. Regression Yield Curves for U.S. Government Securities
### Author(s):
- Kalman J. Cohen
- Robert L. Kramer
- W. Howard Waugh
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
The uses of regression analysis to estimate market yield curves for U.S. Government securities are considered in this paper. Several possible regression models for this purpose are examined. It is found that models which regress either the before-tax yield or the after-tax yield of governments on the number of days remaining to maturity and the square of the logarithm of the number of days remaining to maturity can fruitfully be applied to actual market data in determining yield curves.

## 4. Optimum Seeking with Branch and Bound
### Author(s):
- Norman Agin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
A wide variety of branch and bound algorithms have recently been described in the literature. This paper provides a generalized description of such algorithms. An objective is to demonstrate the wide applicability of branch and bound to combinatorial problems in general. Two existing algorithms are used as illustrations and a discussion of computational efficiency is included.

## 5. Power Comparability—Its Contribution to a Theory of Firm Behavior
### Author(s):
- William R. Sherrard
- Richard D. Steade
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
Although the importance of the interdisciplinary approach to the study of business is well recognized as a means of exploring and applying the knowledge and methodology of social and behavioral science to business activity, the surface has barely been scratched as far as our knowledge of the determinants of business policy and action is concerned. This paper expands, in table form, a model of power measurement developed by a political scientist (Robert A. Dahl), and then applies this power measurement table to business decision making at the board of directors level. We feel that the usefulness of power comparison lies in allowing one to discern which individuals or groups influence decision making in the firm, which, in turn, determines at least the formal basis of firm behavior. In a separate section of the paper the effect of a firm's organizational structure on an individual's power is discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the limitations and contributions of “power comparability” to a theory of firm behavior.

## 6. Bias in Pert Project Completion Time Calculations for a Real Network
### Author(s):
- A. R. Klingel, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
Among network techniques recently widely employed in program management, Pert is addressed to the problem of assessing the manager's chances of completing a project on time. Theory and monte carlo simulation have shown that the Pert method yields results which are biased high, and this paper discusses a real example involving conditions under which the bias is very large. The manager is thus grossly misled into thinking his chances are very good, when in reality they are very poor. If the manager's network has multiple parallel paths with relatively equal means and large variances, Pert calculations will be considerably biased. Simulation can be utilized to estimate the distribution of completion time in this case, and guide the manager in appraising and controlling his chances of completion.

## 7. A Comparison of Short and Medium Range Statistical Forecasting Methods
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Kirby
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average, and Least Squares forecasting models were tested by simulating their operation on seven years of actual data for various sewing machine product groups. The relative accuracy of the forecasts varied according to the length of the period being forecasted and the characteristics of the data. Tests were also conducted on synthetic series designed to isolate the cyclical, trend and noise components. For the series tested, the Exponential Smoothing and Moving Average methods were about equal in overall performance for intermediate range forecasts (next six months' demand). For the short range (next month's demand), the Exponential Smoothing gave slightly better over-all results. The difference in relative performance between the Exponential Smoothing and Moving Average methods for intermediate versus short range forecasts appears to be due to a subcomponent identified as “caused noise.”

## 10. Resistance Against Analysis and Planning in Research and Development
### Author(s):
- Helmut Krauch
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1966
### Abstract:
Many current reflections on science and technological development seem to be concentrated upon the notion that these processes are not subject to man's conscious control. But, instead of demanding an analysis of research itself, from which conscious control might ultimately be expected, they focus their attention on the consequences of scientific activity. They recommend the scientific comprehension of the results of science, on the ground that only thus can we save ourselves from calamitous consequences. A feeling of helplessness and resignation in the face of the apparent autonomy of technological development is quite common. Its origins may reach far back. With Heraclitus, we feel that war is “the father of all things,” and reach the height of our pessimism in Spengler's Kulturkritik. “The master of the world becomes the slave of the machine.”
