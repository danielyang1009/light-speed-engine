## 1. Prospects for the Management Sciences in Advertising
### Author(s):
- Benjamin Lipstein
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
The advertising industry is likely to be three times its current size by 1985. In view of current labor force trends, it is unlikely that the advertising industry will be able to attract a sufficient number of people to service that volume of advertising. The key to servicing this large volume of advertising is likely to be the management sciences which will provide the basis for increased productivity in the advertising industry. On the basis of past technological trends in the industry, this paper attempts to make some predictions as to the kinds of activities that are likely to be required in the agency of the future and the kinds of skills and talents that will be needed to man the agency of the future.

## 2. The Rise of Management Science in Advertising
### Author(s):
- Stanley I. Cohen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
Over the past decade, the roles of Management Science and Operations Research in Advertising have grown, under the salient influence of computer methodology, from a modest experimental project state to a full scale systems state. The rate of growth manifests itself in (1) the size and complexity of problems being tackled, and (2) the widening sphere of techniques being brought in to use. The classic areas of Advertising Research such as Product, Consumer, Media, and Copy Research, defined as the Advertising-Marketing Complex, are availing themselves of the mathematical and statistical modeling techniques being designed throughout the entire research community of the world. Techniques such as mathematical programming, simulation, Bayesian analysis, multivariate analysis, and Markov analysis have become everyday production and research tools to the Advertising Industry. This paper will outline the growth and the current state of important areas of Advertising Research in relation to their involvement with Operations Research and Management Science.

## 3. Load Forecasting, Priority Sequencing, and Simulation in a Job Shop Control System
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Bulkin
- John L. Colley
- Harry W. Steinhoff, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
This paper reports the development, installation and evaluation of a simulation which sequences shop operations for the next shift. Simulation outputs give each foreman the priority of jobs currently in his section and those jobs which might be coming through his area during the next work period. The foreman can determine in advance what tools, raw materials, etc., are needed and obtain them, thus tending to eliminate queue time for hot jobs.

## 4. Scheduling Maintenance and Determining Crew Size for Stochastically Failing Equipment
### Author(s):
- R. C. Vergin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
Past treatment of the single machine maintenance problem has shown that preventive maintenance may be desirable for equipment for which failures are caused at least partially by wear-out factors. In all previous treatment, however, the size of the maintenance-repair crew has been held constant and the optimal maintenance period has then been determined. This paper develops a simultaneous solution for the maintenance-repair crew size and the optimal maintenance period. The optimal maintenance period is seen to shift as the size of the maintenance-repair crew varies.

## 5. A Decision-Theoretic Approach on Deciding when a Sophisticated Forecasting Technique is Needed
### Author(s):
- Lawrence Harris
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
This note describes a decision-theoretic approach for deciding on when it is worthwhile to obtain a sophisticated statistical forecasting model and when an unsophisticated approach suffices. By developing a forecasting loss function for an example, the prior cost of uncertainty is first determined. Based on this cost, it is decided whether the sophisticated model should be obtained. If this is decided in the affirmative, the posterior cost of uncertainty is determined and the net gain from this decision is obtained.

## 6. Technological Forecasting in Perspective
### Author(s):
- Raymond S. Isenson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
The term, technological forecasting, is appearing with ever increasing frequency in the public utterances of government and industrial leaders. Yet it is obvious to even the most casual observer that little agreement exists as to the meaning of the term, the potential for useful forecasting, regardless of detailed nature, or the status of relevant studies. The purpose of this paper is to review generally the various, apparently useful forecasting techniques, to offer a rationale basis for undertaking a technological forecast, and to place technological forecasting in perspective with regard to other planning inputs.

## 7. Capital-Budgeting Decisions Involving Combinations of Risky Investments
### Author(s):
- James Van Horne
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
In this paper, a method is proposed for evaluating combinations of investments when the cash flows are not known with certainty. Various probability concepts are employed; and combinations are evaluated according to their incremental contribution of expected net-present value and variance to the firm as a whole. It is shown that existing investment projects must be considered if the total risk of a particular combination of investment proposals is to be evaluated realistically. Through diversification of investments, a firm is able to obtain the most desirable combination of expected net-present value and risk.

## 8. Subject Performance in Two Six-Man Communication Network Experiments
### Author(s):
- Wayne S. Marshall
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
A detailed report of subjects' behavior in two six-man communication network experiments is given. These are perhaps the first six-man experiments in the Bavelas-type communication networks to be reported. Main features of subject performance lead one to question the idea of “optimal organizational behavior” even in this very simple situation.

## 14. Decision Making, Information Systems, and the Role of the Systems Analyst
### Author(s):
- Oleh Kostetsky
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1966
### Abstract:
A dynamic interaction exists between a firm and its business environment, due to both physical and psychological changes. This necessitates a system to generate a sequence of decisions which will create a sequence of acts modifying the forces within the firm-environment interaction so as to maximize the probability that the firm's basic objectives will be met.
