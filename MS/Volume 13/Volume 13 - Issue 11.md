## 1. Optimal Strategy for Item Presentation in a Learning Process

### Abstract:
We treat a dynamic programming problem concerned with an application of tailoring programmed instruction to the individual student. We use a model of learning based on stimulus-sampling theory in which a subject is to be taught n items in the course of N trials. The problem is to determine a strategy of trial-by-trial item selection to maximize the expected terminal level of achievement of the subject; a trial consists of a test on a selected item followed by a reinforcement or teaching action relative to the item. A subject is either in the “conditioned” or “unconditioned” state with respect to an item. His response to a test is either correct or incorrect, and the probability of a correct response depends upon his state; thus, the state is not in exact correspondence with the response. The reinforcement action permits a probabilistic transition from the unconditioned to the conditioned state during a trial. States are not observable; a strategy is based upon the history of responses to items presented up to the current trial. Associated with a subject is a current state probability vector (λ1, λ2,…, λn), λi= probability of conditioned state relative to item i, given the subject's history to date. We prove that the following (locally optimal) strategy is (globally) optimal: In each trial, present any item for which the current probability of the conditioned state is least.

## 2. A Computer Simulation Model of Municipal Budgeting
### Author(s):
- John P. Crecine
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
An increasing awareness of the importance of urban governmental activities draws attention to municipal expenditures and to the municipal operating budget. Little effort has been directed toward the question of how municipalities allocate resources. The work reported here represents an attempt to develop a positive theory of municipal resource allocation for large metropolitan communities and to subject this theory to empirical tests. Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh are used as data points.

## 3. Competitive Bidding with Asymmetric Information
### Author(s):
- Robert B. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the problem of competitive bidding (via sealed tenders) under uncertainty when one of the parties knows the value of the prize with certainty. A real problem of this type has been reported in a case study by Woods. The equilibrium strategies are derived and characterized for computational purposes in terms of the solution to a related differential equation. An example is solved in detail and found to be rather surprising in terms of the relative strength it imputes to the position of the party with better information.

## 4. Exponential Smoothing and Short-Term Sales Forecasting
### Author(s):
- P. J. Harrison
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
Non-seasonal forecasting methods are examined by considering demand generating processes which are reasonable and general descriptions of customer demand and for which the popular predictors are shown to be optimal. Tests of the adequacy of the generating processes are described. The way in which the forecasting errors vary with the forecasting period is examined, and it is shown that this is dependent not only on the length of the period but also on the values of the forecasting parameters. The sensitivity of the predictors to departures from the optimal parameters is investigated, and the long debated comparison of Holt's linear growth predictor (1957) and Brown's linear growth predictor (1959) is examined. It is shown for the assumed generating model and for forecasting parameters lying within the usual limits, that even if there is an infinite amount of data available to establish the optimum forecasting parameters, the standard error of the one step ahead predictor exceeds that of the Holt predictor by no more than 1.6 percent. The generalized polynomial generating process is shown to have as its optimal least squares predictor the corresponding Box-Jenkins polynomial predictor (1962).

## 5. Parametric Production Planning
### Author(s):
- Curtis H. Jones
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a heuristic approach to the determination of work force and production levels. The existence of two feed-back rules (one for work force and one for production) is postulated. The universe of possible parameters is searched to find the set of parameters that provides the lowest cost or highest profit for a particular firm. Each set of parameters is evaluated by comparing the costs or profits resulting from the application of rules bearing these parameter values to a likely sequence of sales forecasts and actual sales. Decision rules formed in this way give cost and profit results nearly equal to those resulting from the application of the optimal techniques to purely mathematical problems. In more complex and more realistic situations, the results obtained by Parametric Production Planning may be superior to those achieved by a linear programming approach or a linear decision rule.

## 6. Randomized Replacement Rules which Maximize the Expected Cycle Length of Equipment Subject to Markovian Deterioration
### Author(s):
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
A problem of determining the form of optimal replacement policies is treated. Equipment whose changes of state can be described by a finite Markov chain are considered. The objective of the replacement policy is the maximization of the expected time between replacements while keeping the probabilty of an in-service failure below a specified bound. It is shown that, if the equipment “ages,” a replacement policy of simple structure called a randomized control limit rule will be optimal. Such a policy can be determined by linear programming.

## 7. Inventory Depletion Management with Stochastic Field Life Functions
### Author(s):
- William P. Pierskalla
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
Most inventory depletion analysis has been concerned with the case of a deterministic field life function. Since it is rarely the case that the exact field life function of a stock of items would be known, it is more reasonable to treat the case where the field life of an item is a random variable, X(S), which depends only on the age, S, of the item upon issuance. In this stochastic case, it is shown that the policy of issuing the oldest item first (FIFO) is optimal provided E[X(S)] = aS + b where 0 ≧ a > − 1, b > 0, i.e., where the items have a linearly decreasing mean value function, and where some additional, but behaviorally not restrictive, assumptions are made.

## 9. The Piecewise Concave Function
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
An important function which is neither concave nor convex often arises in production and inventory models. This function is herein called piecewise concave and can be considered to be a generalization of the concave function. Essentially it is the maximum of a collection of concave functions. Various properties of piecewise concave functions are explored in this paper. In particular, a theory is developed to locate the point at which such functions are minimized. A short discussion of applications is included.

## 11. Toward Better Curricula Through Computer Selected Sequencing of Subject Matter
### Author(s):
- Martin Israel Taft
- Arnold Reisman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1967
### Abstract:
It is generally recognized that reinforcement, over an extended period of time of a given subject matter taught, enhances the student's mastery and subsequent retention of knowledge and/or skills. Recent major studies of curricula have concentrated on the content and method of presentation but have not made any significant strides towards the systematic exploitation of the potential contribution to the learning process of reinforcement through proper sequencing of subject matter presentation. This paper outlines a mathematical model of the established and industrially validated learning and forgetting theories and presents a computer executed heuristic algorithm for the selection of the best schedule for subject presentation. Applications of this methodology can be made at all levels of our educational system; from the elementary grades through graduate school, in highly academic as well as vocational training programs.
