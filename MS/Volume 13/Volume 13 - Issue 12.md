## 1. On the Art of Modeling
### Author(s):
- William T. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
The problem of teaching or developing creative modeling ability is considered in the light of three basic hypotheses concerning the processes of enrichment (elaboration of very simple models), association (analogy with previously developed structures), and alternating attention to different aspects of the task. Based on these hypotheses, specific steps are presented which have been developed to help individuals acquire modeling skills. The steps are illustrated by means of an example. Other sources of modeling ability are also suggested.

## 3. The Determination of Optimal Investment Policy
### Author(s):
- K. Larry Hastie
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
Using a model similar to Sharpe's, the author discusses the shape of the efficient frontier of security portfolios and the determination of an optimal investment policy. Sharpe shows that in equilibrium, the expected returns and standard deviations of all efficient security portfolios lie along a straight line. In this article, the author demonstrates that this conclusion depends on the assumptions that there exist both a risk-free asset and a single interest rate at which all investors can borrow or lend funds. If either assumption is removed, the expected returns and standard deviations of efficient portfolios will not be linearly related. The author suggests that in equilibrium, the efficient frontier is not unique for all investors, but that the efficient frontier will be different for investors with different borrowing rates. Furthermore, if no risk-less asset exists, a portfolio may exist which has both higher expected real return and lower risk than does a default-free security.

## 4. Measurement Problems in Cluster Analysis
### Author(s):
- Donald G. Morrison
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
In the first part of this paper we will review and modify the cluster analysis procedure presented by Green, Frank and Robinson [Green, P. E., R. E. Frank, P. J. Robinson. 1967. Cluster analysis in test market selection. Management Sci.13 (8, April) B-387–B-400.] in a recent issue of this journal. In revising their procedure, we will raise some very fundamental questions with respect to cluster analysis in particular and multivariate statistics in general. The scale that we use in measuring the input variables (e.g., age, income, education, etc.) will affect the results. The question is: “How do we scale the input variables so that the results are ‘meaningful’?” We will see that some of the usual methods that are used to give statistically meaningful results will not assure us of managerially meaningful results. Finally, a possible “solution” along with its advantages and disadvantages over standard techniques will be presented.

## 6. Developing Standards for Library Expenditures
### Author(s):
- Powell Niland
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of a project to use simple and multiple regression to develop standards for evaluating budget proposals of a university library. Based on a seven-year sample of actual expenditure data, ending with the academic year 1964–65, regression equations were developed for each of the five major categories of library expenditures. These equations were tested against the expenditures approved for the academic year 1965–66. Based on this test, useful standards were developed by employing the regression technique. The technique is proposed as a device for coping with the control of complex activities for which direct standard setting is difficult or prohibitively expensive, in institutional, governmental or business organizations.

This paper does five things: (1) relates earlier developments in management thought to modern organization views; (2) discusses some aspects of decision making, the systems concept, and man/machine systems; (3) identifies the overall goals which an integrated information system should serve; (4) suggests an approach to be followed by information system planners; and (5) attempts to foresee how a widespread use of information systems may affect organization structure and management practice.

## 13. Marketing Science
### Author(s):
- Kenneth A. Longman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
For over fifty years, the idea of joining the word “science” to the word “marketing” has met with considerable skepticism. The two words have often appeared with a question mark and often with much more disparaging epithets. The skepticism has not stopped all progress. The American Marketing Association, for instance, claims its purpose is to foster the advancement of science in marketing. And, with a certain amount of clucking, the marketing community permitted, and even encouraged, the founding of an organization called the Marketing Science Institute. Just this past Spring, in Boston, TIMS officially started its College on Marketing which should certainly be concerned with the question of Marketing Science.

## 14. New Directions in Administration
### Author(s):
- Donald S. Feigenbaum
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1967
### Abstract:
It is my purpose to review the matter of relative emphasis upon the quantitative school of administrative thought as compared to the qualitative school and their long term impacts—or possibly lack of them—upon industrial administration, which in action, quite obviously is always some amalgam of qualitative and quantitative practices. My approach will be to state the case for modern quantitative methods and then to offer some concluding remarks to evaluate this case.
