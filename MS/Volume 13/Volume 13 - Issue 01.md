## 1. Forecasting Non-Stationary Economic Time Series
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to show how certain results obtained by Peter Whittle [Whittle, P. 1963. Prediction and Regulation by Linear Least Square Methods. English Universities Press, London.] may be used to derive the results on adaptive forecasting obtained by Wage and Nerlove [Nerlove, M., S. Wage. 1964. On the optimality of adaptive forecasting. Management Sci. 10(January) 207–24.] and to carry forward the general program of that paper; namely, to study the prediction of those types of non-stationary and non-deterministic series1 which can be reduced to stationary series by a finite linear transformation. For this class of non-stationary series it may be shown in general that the optimal forecast for any future period may be expressed as a linear combination of past values of the series, and past one-step prediction errors; they are, in this sense, “adaptive.” Unfortunately, this class contains series which, when transformed, have infinite moving average representations. For these series the adaptive representation of the optimal forescats will contain an infinite number of terms, and thus, in terms of the original motivation of adaptive forecasting, be less than helpful. Such considerations do, however, suggest what the limits of applicability of the adaptive representation are, and give a criterion for choosing between the autoregressive and adaptive representations in the case of any particular series. The analysis is illustrated by forecasts of unemployment of males, aged 14–19, one, four, and fifteen months ahead.

## 2. Factors Influencing Market Penetration
### Author(s):
- R. W. Allen
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
The decision of a company in the selection of a technological business area to exploit is a difficult one to make because of the many complex factors involved and the uncertainties of predicting future events. To assist the management decision processes, a mathematical model is developed which relates the many factors such as company capability, time, market, competition, investment and costs to the expected economic gain over time. The basis of the model presupposes that the markets of interest are composed of many product areas in which companies will compete for a share. Thus, the model is concerned with two opposing forces (competition versus the company) trying to penetrate the same available product area simultaneously over a given time period. In addition to the model formulation several basic types of markets are analyzed as to their effect on the various economic factors. Also, the effect of the investment program in the market penetration is exhibited as well as the effect of loss in market shares on the maximum economic gain.

## 3. Quadratic Assignment Problem Algorithms and the Location of Indivisible Facilities
### Author(s):
- Frederick S. Hillier
- Michael M. Connors
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the problem of assigning locations to indivisible facilities and its relation to the quadratic assignment problem. It also develops two suboptimal algorithms, one dealing with the general quadratic assignment problem and the other with an interesting special case. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing suboptimal algorithms are presented.

## 5. The Direct Solution of the Transportation Problem with Reduced Matrices
### Author(s):
- Paul S. Dwyer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
A discussion of the importance of a direct method in obtaining all the solutions of a transportation problem, and in obtaining solutions of more general problems, is followed by a discussion of methods of reduced matrices in which the transportation matrix is reduced, by a series of subtractions from rows and columns, to a transformed matrix to which the orthogonality condition is applicable. The direct method proceeds in a series of simple steps to the determination of zero terms having associated xij values which eventually satisfy the row and column equations. Formal and informal versions are presented and application is made to several general problems.

## 6. An Improved Starting Algorithm for the Ford-Fulkerson Approach to the Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Heiner Mueller-Merbach
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for yielding an improved initial dual solution of the transportation problem when the network flow algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson is used. (1) The algorithm is described. (2) It is demonstrated by means of a numerical example. (3) Computational experience is reported. 400 medium-sized (30 × 80; 50 × 60; 50 × 80) test problems with three different kinds of distance matrices and two different kinds of shipment quantity vectors were evaluated. The average improvement over the usual method was about 30%.

## 7. A Deterministic Multi-Period Production Scheduling Model with Backlogging
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
A deterministic multi-period production and inventory model that has concave production costs and piecewise concave [Zangwill, W. I. 1965. A dynamic multi-product, multi-facility production and inventory model. Technical Report 1, Program in Operations Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, April 29.] inventory costs is analyzed. An essential feature of the model is that it permits backlogging of unsatisfied demand; otherwise the model is similar to the one considered by Manne [Manne, A. S. 1958. Programming of economic lot sizes. Management Sci.4(2, Jan.) 115–135.], Wagner and Whitin [Wagner, H. M., T. M. Whitin. 1959. Dynamic version of the economic lot size model. Management Sci.5(1, October) 89–96.], Wagner [Wagner, H. M. 1960. A postscript to “dynamic problems to the firm.” Naval Res. Logist. Quart.7(March) 7–12.], and Veinott [Veinott, A. F., Jr. 1963. Unpublished notes. Stanford University, Stanford, California.]. By permitting backlogging, which mathematically means that inventories can be negative, the concavity assumptions of these authors are no longer appropriate. Instead we consider piecewise concave cost functions to find the form of the minimum cost production schedule. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the minimum cost schedule is also presented.

## 8. On a Class of Optimal Stock Depletion Policies
### Author(s):
- Jan Mossin
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
The following problem is solved by the calculus of variations: How should a monopolist sell off a fixed stock of a commodity so as to maximize the present value of profits if demand per time unit is linear in price and subject to exogenous growth, deterioration is proportional to remaining stock, and carrying cost is proportional to stock.

## 9. On the Generation of Discount Rates and Implicit Prices Through a Replacement Model
### Author(s):
- Hermann Enzer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to generate discount rates and implicit prices by applying theorems of Frobenius and Bellman to non-negative matrices. The model which is developed may be useful in situations in which management decisions must be made regarding the replacement of aging and obsolescing equipment for some specified period of time. One version of the model allows choices among alternatives and another version leads to a deterministic form. The discount rate which is derived is the reciprocal of the maximal growth rate which is obtained as the largest (positive) root of the non-negative matrix introduced in the first version of the model, while the implicit prices arise from an associated eigenvector. The model may be particularly useful in situations where market rates and market prices do not properly reflect values as is the case for some public goods.

## 10. Programming Variable Factors
### Author(s):
- Robert Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1966
### Abstract:
A duality theory and two computational algorithms are developed for variable-factor programming, a name given to linear programming when the profit coefficients are functionally dependent upon a program of variable-factor inputs in limited supply. Computational experience is reported for one of the algorithms. An interesting and useful feature of the dual problem is that it is a concave programming problem, whereas the primal problem is not.
