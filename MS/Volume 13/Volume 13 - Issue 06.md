## 1. A Program of Research in Business Planning
### Author(s):
- H. Igor Ansoff
- Richard C. Brandenburg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to outline a program of research which is needed to improve the state of the art of business planning. We have approached this task by relating planning to management science on one hand, and to certain areas of descriptive knowledge on the other. From these relations we have constructed a comprehensive program for research on planning. Some parts of this program are being actively pursued, some are still in need of attention. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to a two-fold purpose: that it will help give the business planner a sense of unique identity, and that it will provide him with a research program which he can pursue in strengthening this identity.

## 2. An Algorithm and Computational Procedure for Locating Economic Facilities
### Author(s):
- Roger C. Vergin
- Jack D. Rogers
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
The problem of locating economic facilities in such a manner as to minimize the cost of moving inputs from source points to the facilities and outputs from the facilities to subsequent destination points has had considerable attention in recent times. A wide and diverse variety of approaches which give reasonable but not necessarily optimal solutions to such problems has been suggested. This paper suggests a different approach to this familiar problem. For a single facility location problem, an algorithm is presented which produces optimal locations. For the case of locating several new facilities a computer search process is instituted which produces close to optimal locations.

## 3. Inflow of Private Capital and Choice of Planning Strategies
### Author(s):
- V. R. Panchamukhi
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
International flow of private capital can be seen as a situation wherein a variety of conflicting interests are involved. The interests of the government of the country in which foreign investment takes place, do not concur with the interests of the foreign private investor. The interests of the foreign private investor and those of the government of his own country can be mutually conflicting ones, since the private profitability of an investment project differs from its social desirability. The interests of the government of the capital exporting country and those of the government of the capital-importing country, can also be at variance with each other. Our attention here is confined to analyse the first category of conflict of interests, in which the foreign private investor and the government of the capital importing country are the two policy-makers. In this situation, interests of one policy-maker are affected by the choice of planning strategies by the other policy-maker and each wants to choose his strategies so as to “optimise” his interests. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of Game Theory approach in arriving at the “best” planning strategies open to the two policy-makers involved. In the immediately following two sections, we describe the interests of the foreign private investor and those of the government of the capital-importing country (hereinafter called the domestic planner). In the remaining sections, we discuss the problem of optimum policy making as a two-person non-zero-sum game, with the domestic planner and the foreign private investor as the players of the game. The appendix gives the mathematical formulations of the game model and its solutions.

## 4. The Evaluation of Potential New Product Alternatives
### Author(s):
- Marshall Freimer
- Leonard S. Simon
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
In evaluating new product opportunities through the use of a rating scheme, account must be taken of the fact that the individual factors on which the product is being assessed interact in producing an overall result. A score for a product may be thought of as a point in n dimensional space in which are located two density functions, one representing scores of successful products and the other of unsuccessful products. Linear discriminant analysis provides the means for utilizing the likelihood ratio of success to failure for any given potential product (point). The question then arises as to whether to accept the decision dictated by the discriminant analysis or to collect more information concerning the location of the point. Both a posterior and a preposterior distribution can be obtained, yielding the value of additional information and thus determining whether to make the decision now or to postpone it.

## 5. METRI and The Allowance List Problem
### Author(s):
- Gershon Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
The fundamentals of the METRI approach to model-building are discussed. This approach may have applicability where the system to be modelled involves very large numbers of variables, ignorance, uncertainty, and hierarchical relationships, and where the decisions to be made involve enormous amounts of detail. Since the approach was developed in the context of the “allowance list” problem, the application of the approach to that problem is discussed in detail. The problem of “validation” is also discussed, since, as in some other cases, the payoff measure defined by the model has no close parallel in terms of independently available data. The paper is basically an account of certain aspects of a U.S. Navy project.

## 6. Mathematical Models of Growth Allowances for Public Utility Regulation—A Synthesis
### Author(s):
- F. T. Sparrow
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
The construction and application of mathematical models which aid in the determination of fair rates of return for regulated industries is a development of potentially great importance to both the theoretician and the purchaser of regulated industry services. This paper shows that the two apparently dissimilar models of fair rates of return under conditions of growth found in the literature are derivable from a third more general model of such a process. The relative usefulness of the models is discussed, along with the validity of the behavioral assumptions that underlie the models.

## 7. The Use of Mathematical Models in Plant Maintenance Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Efraim Turban
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
This paper describes and discusses the results of a national survey [1] on the use of mathematical models in plant maintenance decision making. The major points considered are: (1) The extent to which such models are used, (2) their potential financial benefits, and (3) the determinants of their use. Of special interest is the finding that these determinants are similar to those involved in the general problem of OR models in imiplementation, despite the technological character of maintenance decisions.

## 8. A Heuristic Model for Scheduling Large Projects with Limited Resources
### Author(s):
- Jerome D. Wiest
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
Present PERT-type scheduling models implicitly assume unlimited availability of resources. As most project schedulers are aware, however, activities may be constrained in their start dates by availability of resources as well as by technological orderings. Analytic solutions to the limited-resource, project scheduling problem are infeasible at present for all but small projects; heuristic approaches seem most promising of useful results. One such approach, described here, is a computer model capable of scheduling single or multiple projects within resource limits and other constraints commonly encountered by the project scheduler. The basic formulation of the model is discussed along with its scheduling heuristics which determine the period-by-period allocation of resources to activities in a project. By changing certain parameters and heuristics in the model, one can simulate project scheduling under varying constraints and scheduling rules. Applications of the model to a number of fictitious and real projects are described.

## 11. Management Science in the World of Today and Tomorrow
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
Operations Research or Management Science, two names for the same thing, refers to the science of decision and its application. In its broad sense, the word “cybernetics,” the science of control, may be used in its place. This science is directed towards those tasks that humans have not yet delegated to machines. Tasks involving human energy and (as we have seen) those involving simple human control have already been conceded to machines even though they have not been fully taken over by them. It is the automation of higher order human decision processes that is the last citadel.

## 12. Time Sharing, Management, and Management Science
### Author(s):
- G. J. Feeney
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1967
### Abstract:
This is going to be a talk: mostly about time sharing, a little bit about the implications for management and an even smaller bit about the implications for management science. Not that these implications are minor. On the contrary, I think time sharing is going to produce profound, irreversible changes in both the practice and the science of management. But instead of the usual inspirational harangue on the revolutionary future that time sharing will bring, let's take a close look at the technical and economic fundamentals which define the invention and the necessity that it answers. Once these fundamentals are clear, you can make your own forecasts.
