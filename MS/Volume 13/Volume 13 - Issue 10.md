## 1. Long Range Planning in Open-Pit Mining
### Author(s):
- Horst Albach
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
In open-pit mining of lignite, production plans have to be set up for a period of about twenty to thirty years. This is partly due to the close interaction of production plans and investment plans and partly due to legal requirements for open-pit mining in Germany. The major uncertainties encountered in setting up a production plan stem from the geological structure of the pit. The total deposit of lignite in the field as well as the stratification of the layers of waste material and lignite can he considered as stochastic variables. The production plan is formulated as a chance-constrained programming problem. The model requires maximization of a linear form subject to linear and non-linear constraints. In order to facilitate computation of the large-scale problems encountered in practical applications the original model is changed into a straightforward linear programming model. An iteration procedure is derived by which the solution to the original non-linear problem is found. The production plan is computed for different levels of acceptable risk. The results form a risk-profit-surface from which management has to pick the optimum-optimorum plan according to its risk-preference function.

## 2. Decision-Making Allowing for Uncertainty of Future Investment Opportunities
### Author(s):
- Seymour Kaplan
- Norman N. Barish
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
All capital investment decisions are made under varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. Evaluations of the desirability of capital investments require estimates of present conditions as well as forecasts of future events which involve these risks and uncertainties. Several recently developed models for capital investment decision-making have involved the random variable treatment of anticipated cash flows. When present worth calculations are made in these cases, a fixed interest rate is usually assumed. When internal rate of return calculations are made, the minimum acceptable rate of return is given a fixed value.

## 3. A Minimum Risk Manpower Scheduling Technique
### Author(s):
- Roger F. Jewett
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
An approach to decision making under uncertainty is presented and its application to manpower scheduling discussed. The Minimum Risk technique yields an optimum series of manpower levels over a time interval in which the workload (manpower required for each period) is not known. It is assumed that the possible workloads can be described, defined by a finite set of mutually exclusive manpower requirements, and their probabilities can be estimated. Each possible workload is examined and the risk of a particular manpower level is related to the added (transition) cost of performing whatever workload occurs, given this manpower level.

## 4. Sales Forecasting with the Aid of a Human Behavior Simulator
### Author(s):
- George Schussel
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
This article describes a recent application of simulation to a forecasting problem. The simulation was of the human behavior characteristics of a diverse group of retail dealers. The purpose of the simulation was to propose and test a new method of forecasting a manufacturer's sales to his retail dealers. A simulation model of dealer behavior was constructed and proved very effective in helping the manufacturer to generate good sales forecasts. Unsophisticated retailers were found to have a sufficiently systematic set of procedures to permit simulation of these procedures by a computer model and it was concluded that effective simulation of the human decision processes of a large non-homogeneous group of businessmen is possible.

## 5. Management Implementation of Scientific Research: An Attitudinal Study
### Author(s):
- Thomas R. Dyckman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
This paper describes a study of the views of managers and researchers toward the problem of improved management implementation of scientific research. The work done here is an extension of the effort begun by Churchman and Schainblatt [Churchman, C. W., A. H. Schainblatt. 1965. The researcher and the manager: A dialectic of implementation. Management Sci.11(4, Feb.) B-69–87.] and continued by Bennis [Bennis, W. G. 1965. Commentary. Management Sci.12(2, Oct.) B-13–16.] and others. A controlled experimental situation was employed to obtain participant views toward the possible methods of improving the implementation situation.

## 6. Some Principles of Practical Welfare Economics
### Author(s):
- Julian L. Simon
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
Non-profit institutions must make many kinds of decisions about allocations of resources. The theory is clear: allocate so that the marginal utility is equal in all uses. But this is more easily said than done.

## 7. Rules for Investigating Cost Variances
### Author(s):
- Richard M. Duvall
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
Several writers have suggested quality control procedures in order to determine when an observed variance of actual cost from standard cost should be investigated in order to determine if the variance is due to non-standard performance. These procedures do not explicitly consider the cost of an investigation and the benefits derived from discovering and correcting the cause for the variance. The purpose of this paper is to indicate how these costs may be made a part of the decision to investigate a given cost variance.

## 8. An Investigation of Design Methodology
### Author(s):
- Gerald Nadler
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
A methodology other than that used for research may be more appropriate for designing and engineering projects. This paper compares the purposes and methodologies of research and of designing, and concludes that while their purposes are different, their current methodologies are the same.

## 9. Simulating Communication Network Experiments
### Author(s):
- Wayne S. Marshall
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
A report of a computer simulation of human behavior in Bavelas-type communication network experiments. The simulation successfully imitates behavior in the five-man chain network, and does reasonably well for a six-man Y net, but fails on a more complex six-man net. Main features of the simulation are described. In order to simulate human behavior, a number of non-optimal activities were initially permitted in the simulation and were discarded gradually by probabilistic selection of “desirable” patterns of message sending. Results lead one to question the notion of “optimal performance,” even for a simple communication task in a small group.

## 10. Basic Concepts for a Theory of Organization
### Author(s):
- Ralph M. Stogdill
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
Classical and behavioral theories can be reconciled if organization is regarded as an input-processing-output system. If material and financial resources are disregarded, all organizations utilize human performances, expectations, and interactions as inputs. In newly formed groups and organizations, these three variables act upon each other to generate structure, operations, and interpersonnel. The latter three variables, once they become differentiated and are utilized in task performance, act as processors to transform the inputs further into product, drive, and cohesiveness as outputs. The hypothesized relationships between the output variables are in accord with research findings and reconcile long standing discrepancies.

## 14. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
The following letter from Drs. Bench and Ginsburg is of great interest to me because it relates details about what a management science group is doing, rather than discussing theory. It specifically dwells on the data processing aspects of the management science role. Although many other groups in government and industry face the same problems as do the authors, not one article published during 1966 in Management Science, Series B, was primarily concerned with the application of computers to operations. Furthermore, not one article mentioned the problems involved in using information generated on computers as part of the models it described. I hope that this letter will help stimulate our contributors to more discussion of the use of computers and information systems.

## 16. Management Education in India
### Author(s):
- M. V. Pylee
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1967
### Abstract:
Fifteen years ago hardly anyone had thought seriously about the need of organized management education in India. Soon after Independence in 1947 a high level Commission on Education was appointed by the Government of India with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan (the present President of India) as Chairman to make a comprehensive study of the various aspects of the educational system then existing and make recommendations for its modification for the new requirements of the nation. This commission however, had little to say on management education. But the formulation of a definite program for planned economic development soon after, brought about a complete change in the situation. The need for technically trained and competent administrative personnel became urgent. As a result, during the past one decade there has been an increasing awareness of the need for providing facilities of training in management.
