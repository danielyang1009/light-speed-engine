## 1. Cluster Analysis in Test Market Selection
### Author(s):
- Paul E. Green
- Ronald E. Frank
- Patrick J. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
Selection of “matched” areas for test marketing is an important undertaking if reliable comparisons among markets are to be made. This usually has been done on a rather arbitrary basis, largely because of the large number of market characteristics on which markets can be viewed as similar or different.

## 2. Financial Implications of Lot-Size Inventory Models
### Author(s):
- William Beranek
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
The definition of the cost of resources devoted to inventories which is inherent in the economic-lot-size procedure implies financial conditions which may not exist. This would lead to infeasibility and/or to a misstatement of carrying costs. If carrying costs are incorrectly stated, then in these, as well as all standard inventory models which emobdy the same assumption, the indicated optimum inventory is either too high or too low, and needlessly excessive costs are incurred by firms using such models.

## 3. Simulation of a Psychological Decision Process in Personnel Selection
### Author(s):
- Robert D. Smith
- Paul S. Greenlaw
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
Considerable attention in recent years has been given to the computer simulation of human thought processes in problem solving. This paper describes the computer simulation of the decision processes of a psychologist dealing with the ill-structured problem of analyzing psychological test scores and other data concerning individuals being considered for various types of clerical and clerical-administrative positions. The computer model was designed to output, as did the psychologist in his decision making, both: (1) numerous interpretive comments about each applicant, and (2) a specific recommendation as to whether the individual should be employed. The methodology and results of this research are described, and the possibility of utilizing computerized models of this type as an aid in personnel selection is suggested.

## 4. The Convergence Technique: A Method for the Planning and Programming of Research Efforts
### Author(s):
- Louis M. Carrese
- Carl G. Baker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
The difficulties encountered in attempts to apply directly some of the standard network analysis techniques to the planning of research programs are discussed. The particularized requirements for a planning system suitable for research efforts are identified, and a technique developed specifically for the planning and programming of research efforts is described. Basically, the technique involves the formulation of a series of flows and arrays depicting major program elements and individual projects, sequentially ordered on the basis of research logic, and graphically represented by a matrix which relates research performance to resources required (including personnel, materials, equipment and facilities, and funds). Because of the nature of research, the technique was developed to avoid the formulation of tight networks with sharp time-to-completion estimates for each project. The application of this technique to two biomedical research programs of the National Cancer Institute is discussed.

## 5. Military Essentiality of Naval Aviation Repair Parts
### Author(s):
- Marvin Denicoff

- Thomas C. Varley
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of ranking items according to their worth, where each item has associated with it a vector of attributes. In particular, a ranking system is developed and tested for aviation repair parts. The objective of the study is to determine whether some items are more important than others for the accomplishment of aircraft missions. If items differ in essentiality, it is important to take such differences into account in providing logistics support. The essentiality ranking is made by generating a vector of attributes for each repair part on the basis of human judgments. These judgments are obtained using a questionnaire which explicitly establishes the ground rules for making attribute assignments. Judgmental priority rules are then applied to the vectors to rank the items. The proposed methodology was tested for four configurations of aircraft. In the course of the study, a wide dispersion in the essentiality of repair parts was found. Of equal significance, a high degree of consistency was also noted among a large number of respondents. The ranking procedure, although designed for military aircraft, has other applications, including commercial ones. Such applications are appropriate whenever budgetary or other considerations require a priority system for allocating resources, e.g., in the procurement and distribution of material stocks including repair parts.

## 6. An Algorithm for Solving Job Sequencing Problems
### Author(s):
- J. T. Presby
- M. L. Wolfson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
The technique described in this paper was devised for sequencing jobs on individual machines having characteristics of: (1) high job changeover costs; (2) small backlogs (10-20 jobs); (3) occasional “rush” orders.

## 7. A Note on Semi-Probabilistic Grading
### Author(s):
- Ira Horowitz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
This note describes the results of using a semi-probabilistic grading system to determine students' grades in a graduate course in quantitative methods. That is, the students are required to make policy decisions to handle traditional sorts of problems, such as inventory and queuing problems. The points a student receives are some known function of his firm's profits for a particular period, the period having been simulated for each student's firm in accordance with a prespecified probability distribution, given the student's recommendations. In addition, he receives a grade on the assignment based on its a priori quality rather than its ex post success. This note describes the results of using this system, results which in turn lead to some interesting speculations about decision-making and decision makers in general. In particular, it is suggested that even persons well aware of sophisticated procedures for making a rational choice among alternatives will not necessarily take advantage of these procedures, and further, that luck plays a more significant role in success than one might be inclined to concede.

## 9. Organizational Decision Making Behavior Under Varying Conditions of Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- David W. Conrath
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
The problem of decision making under uncertainty generally has been treated in a rather constrained fashion. Most writers assume that the decision is to be made by an entity (the problem of utility function amalgamation is ignored), that the process whereby it is reached is of no consequence, and that an adequate definition of uncertainty is that traditionally provided in game theory. We contend, on the other hand, that these assumptions are un-realistically restrictive, and that it would do well to look at the problem in its broader aspects. A general framework is provided for this purpose, and it is used in a relatively simple example to demonstrate a possible application.

## 10. A Two-Stage Forecasting Model: Exponential Smoothing and Multiple Regression
### Author(s):
- Dwight B. Crane
- James R. Crotty
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
This paper presents a forecasting technique which attempts to combine the advantages of both time series analysis and multiple regression. In this two-stage technique, an exponentially smoothed moving average model is used to forecast values of the dependent variable and/or selected independent variables as desired. These forecasts, along with data for other (lagged) independent variables, are then used as inputs to a multiple regression program. The observations are selected sequentially by the regression model so that each equation is based only upon data which would have been available at the time of the forecast, and the coefficiets of the equation are updated as new information becomes available. The final section of the paper describes a successful application of the two-stage model to a demand deposit forecasting problem.

## 12. The Role of the Subconscious in Executive Decision-Making
### Author(s):

## 13. Critique of: “The Role of the Subconscious in Executive Decision-Making”
### Author(s):
- George Fisk
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
Robert Ferber's paper revives a debate almost forgotten in our preoccupation with rational methods for seeking maximum benefits or minimum costs. Normative decision theory helps us to know how to seek optimal solutions, but there is also a need to know how far our daily decisions depart from this ideal. Except for a few studies in experimental heuristics little has been reported in the field of descriptive decision analysis showing how businessmen make everyday decisions. Consequently Ferber's welcome case vignettes reopen the question of how we might proceed in developing more adequate descriptive models of the decision process.

## 14. Critique of: “The Role of the Subconscious in Executive Decision-Making”
### Author(s):
- Kenneth A. Longman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1967
### Abstract:
The subject of subconscious effects on executive decision-making is one quite worthy of the attention of management scientists. If we read our own journal, we find very little attention paid to psychological questions in management. The restriction of interest to the subconscious is, of course, a narrow view of the psychological questions which should concern us, but it is a reasonable starting place.
