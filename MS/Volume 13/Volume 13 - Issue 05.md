## 1. On the Expected Duration of PERT Type Networks
### Author(s):
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
In PERT-type networks, where activity times are random variables, the expected duration of the total project can be approximated by first substituting the expected values of the individual activities, and then evaluating the length of the critical path. This paper develops two improved estimates. Both estimates approach the true expected duration from below, i.e., they are both optimistic estimates.

## 3. On the Convergence of Periodic Reinvestments by an Amount Equal to Depreciation
### Author(s):
- Yuji Ijiri
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the pattern of periodic reinvestments in depreciable assets when the amount of reinvestment in each period is set equal to the amount of depreciation for the period and derives a constant to which the periodic investments converge. The expression for the constant which depends upon the depreciation method is then interpreted in terms of the firm's investment and financing policy as well as its growth rate.

## 4. The Present Value of Investments in Sinking Funds
### Author(s):
- Peter A. Demetriou
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
A discussion of some general properties of investments in sinking funds is followed by a reformulation of an earlier solution of a particular sinking fund problem. Then, a general statement of the problem of calculating the profitability of a sinking fund is followed by a number of applications.

## 5. Non-Linear Programming Via Penalty Functions
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
The non-linear programming problem seeks to maximize a function f(x) where the n component vector x must satisfy certain constraints gi(x) = 0, i = 1, …, m1 and gi(z) ≧ 0, i = m1 + 1, …, m. The algorithm presented in this paper solves the non-linear programming problem by transforming it into a sequence of unconstrained maximization problems. Essentially, a penalty is imposed whenever x does not satisfy the constraints. Although the algorithm appears most useful in the concave case, the convergence proof holds for non-concave functions as well. The algorithm is especially interesting in the concave case because the programming problem reduces to a single unconstrained maximization problem or, at most, to a finite sequence of unconstrained maximization problems. In addition, the paper presents a new class of dual problems, and the algorithm is shown to be a dual feasible method. Another property of the algorithm is that it appears particularly well suited for large-scale problems with a sizable number of constraints.

## 6. Strictly Concave Parametric Programming, Part II: Additional Theory and Computational Considerations
### Author(s):
- Arthur M. Geoffrion
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
The theory presented in Part I of this paper led to a Basic Parametric Procedure for a broad class of strictly concave parametric programs. In this part, additional theory is developed that facilitates efficient computational implementation. An illustrative graphical example is given, and some extensions are indicated.

## 7. Linear Programming Solutions for Separable Markovian Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- Guy T. de Ghellinck
- Gary D. Eppen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the linear programming solutions to sequential decision (or control) problems in which the stochastic element is Markovian and in which the objective is to minimize the discounted sum of expected costs when a discount factor λ, 0 ≦ λ < 1, is used. In praticular, it deals with a class of “separable” problems for which it is possible to define a “reduced” linear programming problem which will yield the optimal policy and the shadow prices for this problem. The reduced problem involves a substantially smaller number (e.g., 3N vs. N2) of variables than the usual formulation of these problems. Two well-known example problems are solved to illustrate the wide applicability and the utility of these results.

## 8. Optimal Issuing Policies in Inventory Management—I
### Author(s):
- William Pierskalla
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
The general inventory depletion problem can be described as the problem of finding an issue policy which maximizes or minimizes a prescribed function when the inventory itself is changing in quality over time. Earlier authors writing on this subject have placed many restrictive assumptions on the model. The assumption of one demand source withdrawing items from the stockpile is removed and the case of several demand sources is considered. Next, it is assumed that there is a constant penalty cost, p, each time an item is issued. It can be described as an installation or work stoppage cost. Finally, the assumption that the field life, L(S), is a concave or convex function is removed. A more general type of function is considered. L(S) is a concave nonincreasing function for Sε [0, t] and L(S) = L(t) = c > 0 for S ≧ t. When L(S) has this form, it provides a good approximation to the general decreasing S-shaped curve. In all of the foregoing cases, optimal policies or bounds on the optimal policies are presented.

## 9. On Choosing an Optimal Technology
### Author(s):
- Martin Weitzman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the problem of choosing, on the enterprise level, a least cost technology for producing a bill of goods. Given certain simplifying assumptions appropriate to a long-run partial equilibrium environment, the problem is shown to be of a form which is solvable with any one of several techniques. Algorithms are presented and discussed. Proofs of their computational properties are provided, and implications for economic theory and decentralized decision making are noted. Finally, the basic model is expanded to consider the effects of modifying some of the economic assumptions.

## 10. Communication to the Editor—A Note on “Mathematical Analysis of Rates of Return Under Certainty”
### Author(s):
- Carl Norstrom
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1967
### Abstract:
In this note a new approach to the rate of return problem is taken in two stimulating articles by Daniel Teichroew, Alexander A. Robichek and Michael Montolbano [Teichroew, D., A. Robichek, M. Montalbano. 1965. Mathematical analysis of rates of return under certainty. Management Sci.11 (3, January)] and [Teichroew, D., A. Robichek, M. Montalbano. 1965. An analysis of criteria for investment and financing under certainty. Management Sci.12 (3, November)]. One of these results, given as theorem II A in the first article, is, however, partly in error.
