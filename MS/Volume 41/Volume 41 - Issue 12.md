## 1. Understanding User Evaluations of Information Systems

### Abstract:
Organizations spend millions of dollars on information systems to improve organizational or individual performance, but objective measures of system success are extremely difficult to achieve. For this reason, many MIS researchers (and potentially MIS practitioners) rely on user evaluations of systems as a surrogate for MIS success. However, these measures have been strongly criticized as lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. Furthermore, empirical evidence of their efficacy is surprisingly weak. Part of the explanation for the theoretical and empirical problems with user evaluations is that they are really a measurement technique rather than a single theoretical construct. User evaluations are elicited beliefs or attitudes about something, and they have been used to measure a variety of different somethings. What is needed for user evaluations to be an effective measure of IS success is the identification of some specific user evaluation construct, defined within a theoretical perspective that can usefully link underlying systems to their relevant impacts. We propose task-technology fit (TTF) as such a user evaluation construct. The TTF perspective views technology as a means by which a goal-directed individual performs tasks. TTF focuses on the degree to which systems characteristics match user task needs. We posit that higher task-technology fit will result in better performance. Further, we posit that users can successfully evaluate task-technology fit. This latter proposition is strongly supported in a survey of 259 users in 9 companies.

## 2. Influence Activities and Strategic Coordination: Two Distinctions of Internal and External Markets
### Author(s):
- Laura Poppo
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
This paper examines empirically two distinctions of internal and external markets: influence activities and strategic coordination. Influence activities that arise from decentralization, imperfect monitoring, and a relative performance system are a potential liability of internal markets, coordination may be worse in internal markets than in external markets. However, strategic coordination is an advantage of internal markets, a hierarchy can more effectively implement strategic policies in internal markets than external markets. The results of this study show that profit center managers engage in influence activities by haggling over price adjustments, causing greater renegotiation costs in internal markets than in comparable external markets. However, implementation of cost reduction, which is a strategic policy, appears to be more effective in internal markets the results show that supplying profit centers disclose more private cost information than external market suppliers. Thus cooperation and competition appear to operate simultaneously in internal markets. In addition, the results suggest that internal markets appear to undermine one advantage of a vertical integration strategy the creation of unique assets, as organizational resource that can generate rents. These results, which are based on data gathered from the internal and external markets of one Fortune 100 company, are exploratory and further work is needed to generalize the findings.

## 3. Representation and Solution of Decision Problems Using Sequential Decision Diagrams
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
In this paper we introduce a new graph, the sequential decision diagram, to aid in modeling formulation, and solution of sequential decision problems under uncertainty. While as compact as an influence diagram, the sequential diagram captures the asymmetric and sequential aspects of decision problems as effectively as decision trees. We show that a unified framework consisting of a sequential diagram, an influence diagram, and a common formulation table for the problems data, suffices for compact and consistent representation, economical formulation, and efficient solution of (asymmetric) decision problems. In addition to asymmetry, the framework exploits other sources of computational efficiency, such as conditional independence and value function decomposition, making it also useful in evaluating dynamic-programming problems. The formulation table and recursive algorithm can be readily implemented in computers for solving large-scale problems. Examples are provided to illustrate the methodology in both asymmetric and symmetric cases.

## 4. Numerical Valuation of High Dimensional Multivariate European Securities
### Author(s):
- Jme Barraquand
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of pricing a contingent claim whose payoff depends on several sources of uncertainty. Using classical assumptions from the Arbitrage Pricing Theory, the theoretical price can be computed as the discounted expected value of future cash flows under the modified risk-neutral information process. Although analytical solutions have been developed elsewhere for a few particular option pricing problems, computing the arbitrage prices of securities under several sources of uncertainty is still an open problem in many instances. In this paper, we present efficient numerical techniques based upon Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European contingent claims depending on an arbitrary number of risk sources. We introduce in particular the method of quadratic resampling (QR), a new powerful error reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulation. Quadratic resampling can be efficiently combined with classical variance reduction methods such as importance sampling. Our numerical experiments show that the method is practical for pricing claims depending on up to one hundred underlying assets.

## 5. Pricing a Class of American and European Path Dependent Securities
### Author(s):
- Jimmy E. Hilliard

- Walter J. Muller, III
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
Path dependent securities depend on current and past values of underlying state variables. Consequently, the usual backward evaluation technique is difficult to apply since state variable values existing earlier in real time are unknown. This paper develops a series of propositions which makes possible the pricing of a certain class of both American and European versions of these path dependent securities.

## 6. Facilitating Coordination in Customer Support Teams: A Framework and Its Implications for the Design of Information Technology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
The management of coordination gaps is critical to the effective functioning of a customer support team. To address the managerial challenge of designing Information Technology (IT) to facilitate coordination in customer support teams, this paper develops a framework describing the drivers of coordination gaps in customer support teams. Measures for the characteristics of problem resolution processes, the characteristics of IT that assist in the management of coordination gaps, and coordination gaps are developed and validated. Results from a field study administered to 399 respondents from 41 teams in Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Seton Hospital, and Southwestern Bell support the proposition that coordination gaps arise from a lack of fit between the characteristics of problem resolution processes used and the characteristics of IT used. What is more important, the results also indicate that processes with differing characteristics require different kinds of IT.

## 7. A Survey of the Implications of the Behavior of the Central Path for the Duality Theory of Linear Programming
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
The literature in the field of interior point methods for Linear Programming has been almost exclusively algorithmic oriented. Very few contributions have been made towards the theory of Linear Programming itself. In particular none of them offer a simple, self-contained introduction to the theory of Linear Programming and linear inequalities. The purpose of this paper is to show that the interior point methodology can be used to introduce the field of Linear Programming. Starting from scratch, and using only elementary results from calculus and linear algebra, we prove that for every value of the barrier parameter, the logarithmic barrier function for the primal-dual problem has a unique minimizer, and that the path of these minimizers (the central path) converges to a strictly complementary pair of optimal solutions. These results were proved more than a decade ago with advanced mathematical arguments. Our proofs are new: they are also simpler and often more natural than the ones currently known. They provide a new approach to the fundamental results of Linear Programming, including the existence of a strictly complementary solution, and the strong duality theorem.

## 8. Using Common Random Numbers for Indifference-Zone Selection and Multiple Comparisons in Simulation
### Author(s):
- Barry L. Nelson
- Frank J. Matejcik
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
We present a general recipe for constructing experiment design and analysis procedures that simultaneously provide indifference-zone selection and multiple-comparison inference for choosing the best among k simulated systems. We then exhibit two such procedures that exploit the variance-reduction technique of common random numbers to reduce the sample size required to attain a fixed precision. One procedure is based on the Bonferroni inequality and is guaranteed to be statistically conservative. The other procedure is exact under a specific dependence structure, but may be slightly liberal otherwise. Both are easy to apply, requiring only simple calculations and tabled constants. We illustrate the procedures with a numerical example.

## 9. A Method for Discrete Stochastic Optimization
### Author(s):
- Sigrn Andradttir
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of optimizing a function over a finite or countably infinite set of alternatives, in situations where this objective function cannot be evaluated exactly, but has to be estimated or measured. A special focus is on situations where simulation is used to evaluate the objective function. We present two versions of a new iterative method for solving such discrete stochastic optimization problems. In each iteration of the proposed method, a neighbor of the current alternative is selected, and estimates of the objective function evaluated at the current and neighboring alternatives are compared. The alternative that has a better observed function value becomes the next current alternative. We show how one version of the proposed method can be used to solve discrete optimization problems where the objective function is evaluated using transient or steady-state simulation, and we show how the other version can be applied to solve a special class of discrete stochastic optimization problems and present some numerical results. A major strength of the proposed method is that it spends most of the computational effort at local minimizers of the objective function. In fact, we show that for both versions of the proposed method, the alternative that has been visited most often in the first m iterations converges almost surely to a local optimizer of the objective function as m goes to infinity.

## 10. Operational Control of the Transportation of Hazardous Materials: An Assessment of Alternative Decision Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1995
### Abstract:
Commercially available tracking systems based on advanced communications and computing technology allow a dispatcher of hazardous material transports to monitor the movement of vehicles on a transportation network in real time. When unexpected events occur, a dispatcher working with this new technology can identify the regions surrounding the transportation network that are affected by these events and determine safe and cost-effective routes for the vehicles that plan to drive through those regions. Four decision models for rerouting hazardous material vehicles in real-time have been assessed in an experimental setting. The first model supports a dispatcher in finding alternative routes (visually), while the second model adds to the display, for each vehicle, an alternative route based on a conservative heuristic. The other two models are based on an ordinal preference and a numerical utility structure to support the dispatcher in determining the impact of the events on transportation safety and costs. The models were embedded into four decision support systems that use multimedia technology to simulate the dispatchers workstations. These systems were then used in an experiment at the dispatching school in Wil, Switzerland, with 32 experienced dispatchers and truck drivers to assess efficiency and accuracy of the four models. The results show that assessing risks and costs with the ordinal preference structure, prior to making routing decisions, is significantly more efficient and accurate than searching directly for new routes. Using a numerical scale for safety and cost assessment was disliked by the subjects and led to inferior results.
