### Published:

### Abstract:
Given that most data used for production studies have not been accumulated for such purposes, it is important that the quantitative tools for messy data which can affect the accuracy of computed technical efficiency measures be found. In this study, high breakdown robust methods are used in conjunction with a robust distance measure defined relative to the minimum volume ellipsoid estimator. The standardized robust residuals from the high breakdown estimators and the robust distance measures are used to statistically and graphically depict both multivariate outliers and leverage points.

### Abstract:
We present an analytical framework for understanding what makes a product category more conducive for store brand introduction. We also investigate market characteristics that help explain differences in store brand market share across product categories. Our findings suggest that the introduction of a store brand is likely to increase retailer's profits in a product category if the cross-price sensitivity among national brands is low and the cross-price sensitivity between the national brands and the store brand is high. Our model predicts that the store brand share would also be greater under these conditions. In addition, we find that the introduction of a store brand is more likely to lead to an increase in category profits if the category consists of a large number of national brandseven though the store brand market share is expected to be lower when there are a large number of national brands. We compare the key predictions of our model with data on 426 grocery product categories. The data are consistent with the predictions of the model.

## 3. Predicting Buyer-Seller Pricing Disparities
### Author(s):
- Jeff T. Casey
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
Numerous studies have shown that compensation demanded (CD) to give up a commodity often greatly exceeds willingness to pay (WTP) to obtain the same commodity, even in incentive compatible experiments that penalize strategic misrepresentation. Observed CD/WTP disparities are too large to be reconciled with traditional assumptions of economic rationality. A prospect theory-based behavioral framework for predicting CD and WTP is proposed which produces five distinct transaction encoding rules, any one of which can in principle apply to a buyer or a seller. According to this framework, CD/WTP gaps occur when buyers and sellers encode the prospective transaction differently, and gaps can occur in multiple ways, and vary in size, depending on encoding. The transaction encoding framework was tested in two experiments. In Experiment 1, model fits to subjects' CD and WTP for lottery tickets were consistent with the hypothesis that buyers and sellers encode transaction problems differently. Moreover, the quite large observed CD/WTP gaps were explained fully by encoding: When differences between buyers' and sellers' encoding processes were taken into account, their estimated utility (value) and probability weighting functions did not differ. The present framework and results show that the widely cited endowment effect is but one of several ways in which loss aversion can give rise to CD/WTP gaps. Consistent with this broadened perspective, Experiment 2 demonstrated CD/WTP gaps in the absence of an endowment effect (and in the absence of rational economic causes). The transaction encoding framework (1) provides a structured approach for predicting and testing the effects of a variety of task factors on pricing behavior and transaction outcomes, and (2) reveals the useful property that, in many cases, the ratio CD/WTP can be interpreted as a direct measure of the degree of loss aversion.

## 4. Dynamic Scheduling of a Production/Inventory System with By-Products and Random Yield
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
Motivated by semiconductor wafer fabrication, we consider a scheduling problem for a single-server multiclass queue. A single workstation fabricates semiconductor wafers according to a variety of different processes, where each process consists of multiple stages of service with a different general service time distribution at each stage. A batch (or lot) of wafers produced according to a particular process randomly yields chips of many different product types, and completed chips of each type enter a finished goods inventory that services exogenous customer demand for that type. The scheduling problem is to dynamically decide whether the server should be idle or working, and in the latter case, to decide which stage of which process type to serve next. The objective is to minimize the long run expected average cost, which includes costs for holding work-in-process inventory (which may differ by process type and service stage) and backordering and holding finished goods inventory (which may differ by product type). We assume the workstation must be busy the great majority of the time in order to satisfy customer demand, and approximate the scheduling problem by a control problem involving Brownian motion. A scheduling policy is derived by interpreting the exact solution to the Brownian control problem in terms of the production/inventory system. The proposed dynamic scheduling policy takes a relatively simple form and appears to be effective in numerical studies.

## 5. An Experimental Investigation into the Efficacy of Visual Interactive Simulation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
The use of a Visual Interactive Simulation (VIS) model for experimental analysis, where the user initiates runs and gathers information as desired without necessarily any respect for formal analysis, is encouraged by some proponents of VIS and VIS software packages. Proponents of formal output analysis view this approach as dangerous and irresponsible.

## 7. The Application of Ranking Probability Models to Racetrack Betting

### Abstract:
Hausch et al. (HZR) (Hausch, D. B., W. T. Ziemba, M. Rubinstein. 1981. Efficiency of the market for racetrack betting. Management Sci.27 14351452.) developed a betting system that demonstrated positive profits at two racetracks. The system assumes running times are distributed exponentially, but other distributions for running times (Henery [Henery, R. J. 1981. Permutation probabilities as models for horse races. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B43(1) 8691.] and Stern [Stern, H. 1990. Models for distributions on permutations. J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.85(410) 558564.]) have been shown to produce a better fit in Bacon-Shone et al. (1992a), Lo (Lo, V. S. Y. 1994. Application of running time distribution models in Japan. D. B. Hausch, V. S. Y. Lo, W. T. Ziemba, eds. Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Markets. Academic Press, 237247.), and Lo and Bacon-Shone (Lo, V. S. Y., J. Bacon-Shone. 1994. A comparison between two models for predicting ordering probabilities in multi-entry competitions. The Statistician43(2) 317327.) using data from Hong Kong, the Meadowlands, and Japan. The better fit is at the cost of severely increased complexity in computing ranking probabilities, though. In response, Lo and Bacon-Shone (Lo, V. S. Y., J. Bacon-Shone. 1992. An Approximation to Ordering Probabilities of Multi-entry Competitions. Research Report 16, Department of Statistics, University of Hong Kong.) proposed a simple model of computing ranking probabilities which closely approximates those based on the Henery and the Stern models and fits the data as well. This paper couples the Lo and Bacon-Shone model and the HZR system. For data sets from the United States and Hong Kong, we show improved profit over the HZR system at lower levels of risk using final betting data assuming zero computational costs. With data from Japan, our model shows little difference in profits from the HZR system.

## 8. Profit Maximizing Cost Allocation for Firms Using Cost-Based Pricing
### Author(s):
- Teresa M. Pavia
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
This work develops a profit maximizing cost allocation scheme for firms that allocate all costs to their various outputs and then use these costs to set prices, a process known as fully-distributed cost-based pricing. If the costs incurred by the firm are not easily traced to a particular output (for example, the electric bill for a shared manufacturing plant), the costs must be allocated. The demand for a given output is assumed to be a function of the price. Hence, the cost allocation scheme that is selected will affect both the price and the demand for the output. The allocation of common costs that maximizes the firm's overall profit under these conditions is identified. Frequently, the profit maximizing allocation allocates none of the untraceable common costs to one or more of the outputs. This allocation scheme stands in contrast to common practices of sharing costs equally or proportionally across outputs. Examples explore the implications of such a profit maximizing cost allocation on prices and demand in four scenarios: i) no constraints, ii) constraints on maximum allowable prices, iii) a change in market size, and iv) cost containment incentives.

## 9. Production Organisation and Risk Control When Market Instruments Are Available
### Author(s):
- Roger J. Bowden
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
A standard result in the theory of production under price risk is that if forward cover is available, production is determined in terms of the known, quoted forward or futures price, rather than expectations of future prices. In practice, however, primary production often involves joint or substitutable products, so that a natural hedge may be available. In addition, costs such as input prices or interest rates are highly variable and may be correlated with output prices. Supply risk adds to this variation. This paper considers the demand for market-based hedging instruments in relation to such natural hedges and to the possible use of storage for hedging purposes. Under normality of conditional price/cost variation it is shown that for relatively arbitrary nonlinear production technologies and attitudes to risk, producers can plan production and derive their demand for futures by decomposing the organisation into a number of activity centres, involving planning, marketing, cost, and treasury functions. Adding up the hedging demands from each centre, and equating to the effective supply of each type of hedge (natural and market), yields a linear system that may be solved for the optimum quantities of each hedge contract.

## 10. Corporate Hedging of Exchange Risk When Foreign Currency Cash Flow Is Uncertain
### Author(s):
- Bhagwan Chowdhry
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
We analyze hedging policies for a corporation that generates a foreign currency cash flow that is not known with certainty. We obtain an intriguing result that the probability of bankruptcy for a firm that attempts to minimize this probability is lower when there is some uncertainty in the exchange rates than when there is no uncertainty in the exchange rates: the firm reduces the probability of bankruptcy by borrowing more than its financing needs through foreign currency borrowing alone and by investing the excess funds in domestic risk-free securities.

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
The purpose of this short paper is to help clarify some questions which have arisen with respect to the suitability, or even the correctness, of the way Saaty's AHP method handles criteria weights, sometimes causing the rank reversal phenomenon. The position set forth in this paper is that this undesirable effect does not, per se, invalidate that method, but it does make it necessary to identify the kind of situations in which the method is suitable.

## 12. Trading Securities Using Trailing Stops
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
In financial markets traders often protect their position from a significant decline by using a trailing stop. Assume the trader is long the market (owns the security). A trailing stop is an order to sell the security at the market, if the price of the security drops to the stop price. The stop price is always less than the market price when the stop is entered. As the price fluctuates, the stop is raised to remain a fixed distance from the maximum price at which the security trades. In this paper we consider two models for the price process: a discrete time random walk and continuous time Brownian motion, both with positive drift. For these price processes we compute the distribution, mean, and variance of the gain to the trader as well as the duration of the trade when a trailing stop strategy is used. Also discussed is the question of optimizing the distance from the current price to the stop.

## 13. Sensitivity to the Service-Time Distribution in the Nonstationary Erlang Loss Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1995
### Abstract:
The stationary Erlang loss model is a classic example of an insensitive queueing system: the steady-state distribution of the number of busy servers depends on the service-time distribution only through its mean. However, when the arrival process is a nonstationary Poisson process, the insensitivity property is lost. We develop a simple, effective numerical algorithm for the Mt/PH/s/0 model with two service phases and a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process, and apply it to show that the time-dependent blocking probability with nonstationary input can be strongly influenced by the service-time distribution beyond the mean. With sinusoidal arrival rates, the peak blocking probability typically increases as the service-time distribution gets less variable. The influence of the service-time distribution, including this seemingly anomalous behavior, can be understood and predicted from the modified-offered-load and stationary-peakedness approximations, which exploit exact results for related infinite-server models.
