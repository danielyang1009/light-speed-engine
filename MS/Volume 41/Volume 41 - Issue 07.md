## 1. Transition Times: Distributions Arising from Time Heterogeneous Poisson Processes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
The units of a heterogeneous population are subjected to shocks. A unit fails, or more generally, undergoes a change of state after a sufficient number of shocks. The shocks for a particular unit are assumed to arrive according to a time heterogeneous Poisson process. The time to a change of state, the transition time, for the unit has a generalized  (gamma) distribution. We assume that the intensity of the Poisson process and the number of shocks until the change of state vary independently across the units according to a  and negative binomial distribution, respectively. The distribution of the transition time is shown to be the generalized F distribution, which includes a number of standard distributions as special cases. We illustrate these results with two empirical examples: modelling coupon redemptions and traffic accidents. In the latter case, the intensity function of the Poisson process includes time varying predictor variables.

## 2. The Invention of the Independence Condition for Preferences
### Author(s):
- Peter Fishburn
- Peter Wakker
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the history and interrelations of three central ideas in preference theory: the independence condition in decision under risk, the sure-thing principle in decision under uncertainty, and conjoint independence for multiattribute decisions and consumer theory. Independence was recognized as an important component of decision under risk in the late 1940s by Jacob Marschak, John Nash, Herman Rubin, and Norman Dalkey, and first appeared in publication in Marschak (Marschak, J. 1950. Rational behavior, uncertain prospects, and measurable utility. Econometrica18 111141.) and Nash (Nash, J. F. 1950. The bargaining problem. Econometrica18 155162.). The sure-thing principle can be credited to Savage (Savage, L. J. 1953. Une Axiomatisation du Comportement Raisonnable Face  l'Incertitude. Colloq. Internal. Centre National Rech. Sci.40 Economtrie 2940; Savage, L. J. 1954. The Foundations of Statistics. Wiley, New York (2nd edn., Dover, New York, 1972.). Conjoint independence for consumer theory was introduced by Sono (Sono, M. 1943. The effect of price changes on the demand and supply of separable goods (in Japanese). Kokumin Keisai Zasshi74 151.) and Leontief (Leontief, W. W. 1947a. A note on the interrelation of subsets of independent variables of a continuous function with continuous first derivatives. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.53 343350; Leontief, W. W. 1947b. Introduction to a theory of the internal structure of functional relationships. Econometrica51 361373.); a form of it can also be recognized in Samuelson (Samuelson, P. A. 1947. Foundations of Economic Analysis. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA.), presented earlier in Samuelson (Samuelson, P. A. 1940. Foundations of analytical economics, the observational significance of economic theory. Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, Boston, MA.).

## 3. A Contextual Uncertainty Condition for Behavior Under Risk
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
Suppose that your choice between uncertain financial prospects is made more difficult by two independent contextual uncertainties concerning the size of your existing wealth. One contextual uncertainty has a greater spread than the other. If you could resolve one of these contextual uncertainties before making your choice, would you rather it be the larger or the smaller? In this paper we explore the intuitive notion that it ought to be more advantageous to resolve larger rather than smaller contextual uncertainties. The utility function for wealth u(w) = aw  becw (a, b, c  0) is the only utility function that satisfies this condition and that is also increasing and risk averse at all wealth levels.

## 4. Mean-Variance-Instability Portfolio Analysis: A Case of Taiwan's Stock Market
### Author(s):
- Shawin Lee
- Kuo-Ping Chang
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
This paper applies Talpaz, Harpaz, and Penson's (THP) (Talpaz, H., A. Harpaz, J. B. Penson, Jr. 1983. Risk and spectral instability in portfolio analysis. Eur. J. Oper. Res.14 262269.) mean-variance-instability portfolio selection model to eight selected Taiwan stocks during 198089 to demonstrate how instability preference affects the traditional mean-variance frontier. In contrast to THP's finding, the empirical results show that Taiwan's high-frequency stocks have high, not low, variance. This indicates that Taiwan investors, unlike U.S. investors, prefer to speculate in high-variance stocks. The empirical results also show that short selling may increase the risk of the portfolio when the investor is instability preferred.

## 5. Interactive Approaches for Discrete Alternative Multiple Criteria Decision Making with Monotone Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- M. Murat Kksalan
- Paul N. S. Sagala
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop interactive approaches for the discrete alternative multiple criteria decision making problem. We develop an algorithm that finds the most preferred alternative of a decision maker (DM) assuming only that the DM has a monotonic utility function. The algorithm divides the criteria space into a number of smaller subspaces and then uses the ideal points of these subspaces to eliminate alternatives. We also develop a more efficient version of the algorithm for the more restrictive case of a monotonic quasiconcave utility function. We present favorable computational results in terms of the required number of pairwise comparisons for both versions of the algorithm. We then develop a general algorithm that first identifies the type of the DM's utility function and then employs the approach that is compatible with the identified utility function type. We also present computational results for the general algorithm.

## 6. Evaluating Efficiency-Effectiveness-Equality Trade-Offs: A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach
### Author(s):
- Boaz Golany
- Eran Tamir
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
This paper presents a resource allocation model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The model extends the original objective of the DEA methodology from measuring efficiency to include the evaluation of various aspects of effectiveness and equality considerations. The model is formulated as a linear program that can be solved by means of a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm. Theoretical properties of the model are compared with those corresponding to the model developed by Mandell (Mandell, M. B. 1991. Modelling effectiveness-equity trade-offs in public service delivery systems. Management Sci.37(4) 467482.) to evaluate the trade-off between equity and effectiveness. A numerical example is used to illustrate the comparison between the models.

## 7. Professional Service Organizations and Focus
### Author(s):
- Curtis P. McLaughlin
- Shitao Yang
- Roland van Dierdonck
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
This paper suggests a framework for operations managers to use in making focus decisions in professional services. This framework is supported empirically from data from the health care industry using three types of data: (1) industry statistics, (2) case studies, and (3) questionnaire surveys. Our objective has been to: (1) gain a better understanding of the concept of focus as it applies to the health care sector, (2) develop a framework to assist service operations managers with focus decisions, and (3) develop a base from which to generalize about micro-focusing decisions in professional services.

## 8. A Note on Multi-Regional Marketing
### Author(s):
- Charles A. Ingene
- Mark E. Parry
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
This paper examines the profit maximizing behavior of a vertically integrated firm that operates in n geographically distinct regions. A pair of alternative managerial decision scenarios are considered. In one scenario, all marketing mix variables are manipulated at the regional level, so that each region may choose different levels of each marketing variable. In the second scenario, one marketing variable is manipulated globally, so that its level is identical in all regions. The first scenario generates an n-region version of the Dorfman-Steiner first-order conditions for profit maximization. However, under some cost structures the profits associated with this Dorfman-Steiner scenario are dominated by those associated with the second, Global-Regional scenario. This second scenario yields an optimal solution in which the global marketing variable may have a negative marginal impact on sales in some regions. As a result, some managerial implications of the second scenario differ strikingly from those of the Dorfman-Steiner scenario.

## 10. Product-Process Development Integration in Manufacturing
### Author(s):
- John E. Ettlie
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
Organizations vary greatly in their approaches and success in the introduction of new products and services. In this study, it was proposed that much of this variance can be captured by understanding the extend to which product design and process design are integrated in new program launches. A mailed survey of 43 domestic firms was used to test four propositions concerning product-process development practices. Significantly, it was found that firms using the more rare design-manufacturing personnel integrating mechanisms (engineering job rotation and mobility) have higher sales per employee. Results of a discriminant analysis show that firms benchmarking on product development practices, as contrasted with performance benchmarks, were significantly more likely to use both the rare and the more common forms of design-manufacturing integration (i.e., train personnel in new design, methods, have manufacturing sign-off on design reviews, and restructure, e.g., use teams). Significantly, these firms also report a greater proportion of degreed manufacturing engineers. Not surprisingly, larger firms and business units were found to take longer to develop new products.

## 11. Control Modes in International Service Operations: The Propensity to Franchise
### Author(s):
- Karin Fladmoe-Lindquist
- Laurent L. Jacque
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
What determines a service firm's organizational choice between equity-based control and franchising? This question, which has elicited some theoretical answers and a few empirical tests in a domestic setting, has never been addressed in an international context before. This study explains the mode of control chosen in terms of a theoretical framework which borrows from agency theory and transaction cost analysis. The propensity to franchise internationally was found to be directly related to (i) monitoring costs associated with geographical and cultural distance between the principal (franchisor) and its foreign agents (franchisees), (ii) the principal's international experience, and (iii) the degree of host countries' contextual uncertainty but inversely related to the service firm level of brand name asset specificity.

## 12. Global Disaggregation of Information-Intensive Services
### Author(s):

- Richard O. Mason
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
Information-intensive services are being globally disaggregated as corporations respond to the pressures of increasing global competition, and take advantage of the opportunities made available by the progress of information technology and the emerging global work force. In order to globally disaggregate services, corporations must decide whether or not to carry out a service activity within the organization, and where to locate it, within or outside the geographic boundary of the home-base country. This paper analyzes the opportunities and challenges of global disaggregation of information-intensive services. Specifically, the paper proposes a taxonomy of disaggregation, and develops a theoretical framework that identifies the criteria and guidelines for successfully selecting service activities to be globally disaggregated.

## 13. Effects of Setup and Processing Time Reductions on WIP in the JIT Production Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1995
### Abstract:
Sarkar and Zangwill (S-Z, [Sarkar, D., W. I. Zangwill. 1991. Variance effects in cyclic production systems. Management Sci.37(4, April) 444453.]) have shown that in the presence of variance, setup and processing time reductions can have detrimental effects on the work-in-process (WIP) inventory in both push and pull (JIT) systems. In this note, we point out that the merits of such a warning for JIT production systems are questionable.
