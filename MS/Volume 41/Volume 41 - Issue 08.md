## 1. Union-Firm Bargaining and the Influence of Product Market Power and Production Technology on Systematic Risk
### Author(s):
- Jacques Bughin
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
The relationship between the CAPM firm beta and the firm's microeconomic decisions is studied by a model under uncertainty, which combines the feature of an ex ante inputs substituable production technology and the existence of a union which bargains over various economic dimensions of the firm.

## 2. Models and Algorithms for Transient Queueing Congestion at Airports

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
We develop a new model for studying the phenomenon of congestion in a transient environment, focusing on the problem of aircraft landings at a busy hub airport. Our model is based on a Markov/semi-Markov treatment of changes in the weather, the principal source of uncertainty governing service times, together with a treatment of the arrival stream as time-varying but deterministic. The model is employed to compute moments of queue length and waiting time via a recursive algorithm. To test the model, we conduct a case study using traffic and capacity data for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Our results show that the model's estimates are reasonable, though substantial data difficulties make validation difficult. We explore, as examples of the model's potential usefulness, two policy questions: schedule interference between the two principal carriers, and the likely effects of demand smoothing policies on queueing delays.

## 3. Expert Support Systems for New Product Development Decision Making: A Modeling Framework and Applications
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Liberatore
- Anthony C. Stylianou
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
A modeling framework that merges knowledge-based expert systems and decision support systems with management science methods for project evaluation is presented. In particular, the strategic decision to commit to full-scale development of a new product is considered. At the core of the framework are the methods and techniques used for acquiring, modeling and processing the expert knowledge and data. Methods and techniques used include scoring models, logic tables, the analytic hierarchy process, discriminant analysis, and rule-based systems. The suggested modeling approach obtains the benefits of normative modeling as well as the flexibility and developmental advantages of expert systems. Additional benefits include reduced information processing and gathering time, which can help to accelerate the product development cycle. Potential spin-offs of this research include applications for project evaluation throughout the product development cycle and other areas such as capital budgeting. Finally, a series of related case studies that have successfully implemented this framework is described.

## 4. Dual Sourcing in Repeated Procurement Competitions
### Author(s):
- Dorothy E. Klotz

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
The issue of maintaining competition over time in a repeated procurement setting is important for both government and private sector buyers. The U.S. Department of Defense has experimented with splitting production quantities between two or more contractors in an effort to make government business more attractive for the private sector. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of this strategy. We find that in a two-period model with production learning and entry costs, dual sourcing, even for the specific mechanism we consider, in some cases, reduces overall expected cost. Moreover, if buyers are unable to commit to long-term contracts or suppliers are unable to bid away anticipated gains, the incentives to dual source are often stronger.

## 5. Measuring System Usage: Implications for IS Theory Testing
### Author(s):
- Detmar Straub

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
There is widespread agreement among researchers that system usage, defined as the utilization of information technology (IT) by individuals, groups, or organizations, is the primary variable through which IT affects white collar performance. Despite the number of studies targeted at explaining system usage, there are crucial differences in the way the variable has been conceptualized and operationalized. This wide variation of system usage measures hinders the efforts of MIS researchers to compare findings across studies, thus impeding the accumulation of knowledge and theory in this area.

## 6. Market Provision of Custom Software: Learning Effects and Low Balling
### Author(s):
- Seungjin Whang
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
Due to reusability of program code and learning effects in software development, development cost of custom software typically decreases in time and experience. This creates a first-mover advantage to software developers. The paper studies whether the benefits of declining development costs are passed on to buyers in the form of lower prices when developers bid strategically. By using a model of bidding auctions we characterize equilibrium bidding strategies of two software developers. In order to become the first mover and attain future market dominance, developers find it optimal to forgo profits from the first projects. As a result, bid prices (= development cost plus a profit margin to the developer) to the buyers may not necessarily decrease over time, and even if so, not as fast as development cost drops. We also show that bidders expect a higher profit margin from a high-variance project. Thus, if there exist high-variance projects in the future, developers are more likely to submit below-cost bid prices or low ball.

## 7. On the Accuracy of the Simple Peak Hour Approximation for Markovian Queues
### Author(s):
- Linda V. Green
- Peter J. Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
We empirically explore the accuracy of the simple stationary peak hour approximation (SPHA) for estimating peak hour performance in multiserver queuing systems with exponential service times and periodic (sinusoidal) Poisson arrival processes. We show that the SPHA is very good for a range of parameter values corresponding to a reasonably broad spectrum of real systems. However, we do find and document that there are many situations in which this approximation will be very inaccurate.

## 8. Optimal Starting Times for End-of-Season Sales and Optimal Stopping Times for Promotional Fares
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
Many industries face the problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal goods such as air-conditioners or winter coats before the end of the season. Given a fixed number of seats, rooms, or coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing of a single price change from a given initial price to either a given lower or higher second price. Under mild conditions, we show that it is optimal to decrease (resp., to increase) the initial price as soon as the time-to-go falls below (resp., above) a time threshold that depends on the number of yet unsold items.

## 9. Note on Adjustments to Analysts' Earnings Forecasts Based Upon Systematic Cross-Sectional Components of Prior-Period Errors
### Author(s):
- Pieter T. Elgers
- May H. Lo
- Dennis Murray
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
This study assesses the effectiveness of using systematic components of cross-sectional forecast errors from prior years in order to adjust current analysts' earnings forecasts. The empirical results document that a significant component of the cross-sectional MSE in analysts' forecasts is systematic, and that parameter estimates from earlier periods enable the elimination of a substantial portion of the systematic errors in current forecasts. Further improvements in forecast accuracy are attained by the incorporation of prior-year excess security returns in order to reduce unsystematic error.

## 10. Convergence of Subdifferentials Under Strong Stochastic Convexity
### Author(s):
- Stephen M. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
We show that if a sequence of random functions satisfies strong stochastic convexity with respect to a parameter, and if the sequence converges pointwise with probability one, then any sequence of elements extracted from the subdifferentials of the functions in the sequence will converge to the subdifferential of the limiting function, again with probability one. This result holds with no differentiability assumption on the limiting function, and even if the limiting function is itself random. It thus extends earlier work, in particular results by Glynn and by Hu. One application is in proving an extended form of strong consistency for infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) when suitable convexity properties hold.

## 12. Project Evaluation and Control in Decentralized Firms: Is Capital Rationing Always Optimal?
### Author(s):
- Tae-Young Paik

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1995
### Abstract:
When capital investments are made in an agency setting, we show that, even without risk considerations, capital rationing need not be the only rational outcome. We analyze a principal-agent model with risk neutrality and with two productive inputs: the agent's efforts and capital investment. The two inputs can be either economic complements or substitutes. The agent has pre-contract private information about his own type. The output is measured with an additive noise. We show that when the two inputs are substitutes, the optimal solution entails a marginal capital rationing. But when the two inputs are complements, then either a marginal capital rationing or a marginal leniency could be the optimal response. Our results, therefore, provide an explanation for why firms may employ a capital rationing for a project that may increase manufacturing complexity and hence may reduce (managerial) labor productivity, yet employ a less strict criterion for evaluating a productivity-enhancing project. This result contrasts with earlier results where only a capital rationing is shown to be optimal.
