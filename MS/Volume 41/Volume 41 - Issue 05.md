### Abstract:
This research examines how retailer and consumer responses influence a manufacturer's optimal advertising and trade promotion plans. We develop a dynamic optimization model which considers the actions of the manufacturer, retailers, and consumers. The manufacturer attempts to maximize its profits by advertising directly to consumers and offering periodic trade deal discounts to the retailer in the hope that the retailer will in turn pass through a retailer promotion to the consumer. We show how the manufacturer's optimal allocation depends on consumer response to advertising, consumer response to retailer promotions, retailer inventory carrying cost, and retailer passthrough behavior. For example, we find that retailer carrying costs and promotion wearout play a central role in constraining expenditures on trade promotions. We predict that as trade promotions are designed to eliminate forward buying, manufacturers will find it in their interest to promote more steeply. We also find a natural tendency for advertising and trade dealing to substitute for each other in an optimal plan.

### Abstract:
Many practical product line design problems have large numbers of attributes and levels. In this case, if most attribute level combinations define feasible products, constructing product lines directly from part-worths data is necessary. For three typical formulations of this important problem, Kohli and Sukumar (Kohli, R., R. Sukumar. 1990. Heuristics for product-line design using conjoint analysis. Management Sci.36 14641478.) present state-of-the-art heuristics to find good solutions. In this paper, we develop improved heuristics based on a beam search approach for solving these problems.

## 3. The Risk-Averse (and Prudent) Newsboy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
The effects of risk and risk aversion in the single-period inventory (newsboy) problem are examined. Comparative-static effects of changes in the various price and cost parameters are determined and related to the newsboy's risk aversion. The addition of a random background wealth and of an increase in the riskiness of newspaper demand are also examined. Although many of the comparative effects generally are ambiguous, some fairly simple restrictions on preferences and/or risk increases are shown to lead to qualitatively deterministic results.

## 4. Valuing Risky Projects: Option Pricing Theory and Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- James E. Smith
- Robert F. Nau
### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
In the academic literature and professional practice, there are a number of alternative and apparently competing methods for valuing risky projects. In this paper, we compare and contrast three different approaches: risk-adjusted discount-rate analysis, option pricing analysis, and decision analysis, focusing on the last two. We show that, in contrast to some of the claims made in the real options literature, when both option pricing and decision analysis methods are correctly applied, they must give consistent results. We also explore ways in which option pricing and decision analysis methods can be profitably integrated. In particular, we show how option pricing techniques can be used to simplify decision analysis when some risks can be hedged by trading and, conversely, how decision analysis techniques can be used to extend option pricing techniques to problems with incomplete securities markets.

## 5. Sequential Choice Under Ambiguity: Intuitive Solutions to the Armed-Bandit Problem
### Author(s):
- Robert J. Meyer
- Yong Shi
### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
The process by which individuals learn from feedback when making recurrent choices among ambiguous alternatives is explored. We describe an experiment in which subjects solve a variant of the classic armed-bandit problem of dynamic decision theory, set in the context of airline choice. Subjects are asked to make repeated choices between two hypothetical airlines, one having an on-time departure probability which is known a priori, and the other has an ambiguous probability whose true value can only be discovered by making sample trips on the airline. Subjects attempt to make choices in such a way as to maximize the total number of one-time departures over a fixed planning horizon. We examine the extent to which actual choice patterns over time are consistent with those which would be made by a decision maker acting as an optimal Bernoulli sampler. The data offer support for a number of expectedand some unexpecteddepartures from optimality, including a tendency to underexperiment with promising options and overexperiment with unpromising options, and a tendency to increasingly switch between airlines as the average base rate of departures decreases. Implications of the work for the descriptive validity of normative dynamic decision models is explored, as well as for the generalizability of previous findings about choice under ambiguity to dynamic settings.

## 6. Unification of Linear Programming with a Rule-Based System by the Post-Model Analysis Approach
### Author(s):
- Jae Kyu Lee
- Yong Uk Song
### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
We attempt to unify a linear programming model with a rule-based system via overlapped decision variables. Since a rule base can be regarded as an acyclic AND/OR digraph, the unified model is virtually a multiobjective decision making problem that considers both numeric and symbolic objectives and decision variables. To solve this problem, the Post-model Analysis approach is adopted. An essential feature of the Post-model Analysis is that it supports nondominated tradeoffs among the numeric and symbolic objectives. So, this paper proposes a set of methods for computing the nondominated solutions. A prototype, UNIK-PMA that realizes the idea is developed as a subsystem of the UNIK (UNIfied Knowledge) system.

## 7. The Influence of Supervisory Promotion and Network Location on Subordinate Careers in a Dual Ladder RD&E Setting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
This longitudinal study examines the impacts of supervisors' promotion paths and gatekeeper status on the career outcomes of technical subordinates in a dual ladder system. Results indicate that project supervisors significantly affect the chances of one's promotion along each track. Professionals reporting to supervisors promoted to the technical ladder were significantly more likely to also be promoted technically, especially in research. On the other hand, professionals reporting to gatekeeping supervisors in development were significantly more likely to be promoted up the managerial ladder. Gatekeeper status was more important in influencing subordinates' communication activities and subsequent promotions than supervisors' promotion path. These results underscore the importance of managing socialization and the career paths of gatekeepers and those reporting to them for enhancing the success of dual ladder reward systems.

## 8. Line Reversibility of Tandem Queues with General Blocking
### Author(s):
- Dinah W. Cheng
### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
We extend the line reversibility property to a serial production system controlled using the general blocking scheme. The control mechanism is characterized by three vectors of integer parameters (a, b, k) which are, respectively, control parameters for the number of raw jobs, finished jobs, and buffer positions at each stage. We establish conditions under which the time to process a given set of jobs in a system does not change when the control parameters are in the reversed order. For cases where reversibility does not hold, we introduce a more restrictive from reversibilityreferred to as semi-reversibilityand establish conditions under which the property holds. Our results imply reversibility of the kanban system and provide an alternative proof for previous results established for the communication and the manufacturing blockings. Our approach is simple and readily extends to closed systems where the number of jobs in the system is kept constant. Finally, we show, via an example, that in general reversibility does not prevail for this blocking mechanism.

## 9. Fast Solution and Detection of Minimal Forecast Horizons in Dynamic Programs with a Single Indicator of the Future: Applications to Dynamic Lot-Sizing Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
In most dynamic planning problems, one observes that an optimal decision at any given stage depends on limited information, i.e., information pertaining to a limited set of adjacent or nearby stages. This holds in particular for planning problems over time, where an optimal decision in a given period depends on information related to a limited future time horizon, a so-called forecast horizon, only. In this paper we identify a general class of dynamic programs in which an efficient forward algorithm can be designed to solve the problem and to identify minimal forecast horizons. Such a procedure specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for a stage to arise as a forecast horizon. This class of dynamic programs includes the single-item dynamic lot-sizing model with general concave costs, both with and without backlogging, to which special attention is given.

## 10. Optimal Batch Sizing and Repair Strategies for Operations with Repairable Jobs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model of a bottleneck facility that performs two distinct types of operations: regular and repair. Both switch-over time and cost are incurred when the facility switches from performing one type of operation to a different type. Upon the completion of a batch of jobs in the regular mode, each batch is subjected to a test, where the entire batch (of jobs) will be classified accordingly as either nondefective, repairable, or nonrepairable. A nondefective batch continues its process downstream, a nonrepairable batch is scrapped, and a repairable batch can be cycled back to the bottleneck facility for repair. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal repair policy for the bottleneck facility so that the long run average operating profit is maximized. We first characterize the optimal repair policy by showing that the optimal repair policy must take one of the two forms: a repair-none policy under which all repairable batches are scrapped, or a repair-all policy under which all repairable batches are repaired. We then develop optimality conditions for the repair-none policy and the repair-all policy. When the repair-all policy is optimal, we further show that there exists an optimal threshold operating policy that can be described as follows: upon completion of a regular batch, switch over to the repair mode only if the number of available repairable batches exceeds a certain threshold value. We also evaluate the impact of batch sizes, yield, and switch-over cost on the optimal operating policy.

## 11. Price Competition and Compatibility in the Presence of Positive Demand Externalities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
In many cases, the benefit to a consumer of a product increases with the number of other users of the same product. These demand interdependencies are referred to in the literature as positive demand externalities or network externalities. This paper examines the dynamic pricing behaviors of an incumbent and a later entrant, with special attention to the impacts of demand externalities, compatibility, and competition on prices and profits. Defining market power as the ability to price above a competitor without losing market share, we show how demand externalities and installed base combine to confer market power. We model optimal pricing as a differential game with the optimal price trajectory established as Nash open-loop controls. For a duopoly durable goods market with strong demand externalities, the results show an increasing price trajectory can be optimal. As expected, a new entrant is better off if its products are compatible with those of the incumbent, especially when demand externalities are strong and the installed base of the incumbent is large. Less intuitively, the incumbent as well may be better off agreeing on common standards. The comparison of monopoly and duopoly shows that under strong demand externalities and a small installed base, the incumbent profits from compatible entry.

## 12. An EOQ Model with Random Variations in Demand
### Author(s):
- Percy H. Brill
- Ben A. Chaouch
### Published:
- 1 May 1995
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model that incorporates variations in the demand rate at random time points into the inventory planning decision. These changes in demand may occur due to economic recessions, labor strife starting or ending, or other events that result in a period of time during which the rate of demand is shifted up or down from its current level. The paper uses system-point level-crossing theory to derive expressions for the distribution and expected value of on-hand inventory, ordering rate, and the expected total cost rate for a given ordering policy. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, and a number of qualitative properties are provided to illustrate the use of the results to obtain optimal order quantities.
