### Abstract:
In this paper we address the discrete resource allocation problem in a deterministic flow line. We assume that the processing times are convex and nonincreasing in the amount of resources allocated to the machines. We consider the resource allocation problem for a fixed sequence of jobs for various performance criteria (makespan, weighted sum of completion times, cycle time for cyclic schedules), and develop a formulation of the problem as a convex program, where the number of constraints grows exponentially with the number of jobs and machines. We also present a generalization of the formulation for resource allocation problems in acyclic directed graphs. We demonstrate that the problem is NP-complete in the strong sense and present an effective solution procedure. The solution procedure is an implicit enumeration scheme where a surrogate relaxation of the formulation is used to generate upper and lower bounds on the optimal objective function value. Finally, we address the simultaneous scheduling and resource allocation problem, and we present an approximate and iterative solution procedure for the problem.

## 2. Optimal Timing of Reviews in Concurrent Design for Manufacturability

### Abstract:
Concurrent design can reduce the time required to develop new products and redesign old ones. In contrast to the conventional approach, in which the product design is (nearly) completed before it is thrown over the wall to the process design group, concurrent design for manufacturability, as conceptualized here, conducts a number of progress reviews during the product design process. Frequent reviews have two benefits: (1) (Parallel Development) process designers receive sufficient information about the design to enable them to work in parallel with the product designers, and (2) (Quality Control) flaws in the design are discovered soon after they are introduced, saving the time and resources required for redesign later. The disadvantage of frequent reviews is that each review requires setup/penalty time that otherwise would not be required. The optimal policy is derived for some special stationary cases of the model. When the parallel development benefit dominates, the review periods either increase or decrease according to the rate at which product design work empowers useful process design work to be conducted. When the quality control benefit dominates, the review periods will vary only to the extent that the quality related parameters change. Numerical examples illustrate the insights gained from the analysis.

## 3. Minimizing Single-Machine Completion Time Variance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
In this article the problem of minimizing the completion time variance in n-job, single-machine scheduling is considered. The release times for all jobs are assumed to be zero. A new quadratic integer programming formulation is introduced. A Lagrangian relaxation (LR) procedure is developed to find a lower bound (LB) to the optimal objective value. When the number of jobs is between 100 and 500, our computational study shows that the lower bounds obtained by the LR procedure are very close to the best known objective values. A new heuristic algorithm is also described. The first phase of the heuristic algorithm is a construction procedure whose purpose is to identify a good initial sequence. The second phase is an improvement procedure based on pairwise interchanges. The new heuristic algorithm provides improved solutions compared to the best known heuristic.

## 4. Drivers of Customer Satisfaction for Software Products: Implications for Design and Service Support
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
We study the key determinants of customer satisfaction with software products. Our analysis, based upon a large sample of over 2,500 customer responses, suggests that capability and usability are the critical drivers of overall customer satisfaction. We also find that the importance of seven key satisfaction factors differs across customer and product segments. Our results have significant implications for Quality Function Deployment in making design and service support choices for software products.

## 5. Configurations of Interorganizational Relationships: A Comparison Between U.S. and Japanese Automakers
### Author(s):
- M. Bensaou
- N. Venkatraman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
This paper seeks to uncover dominant configurations of interorganizational relationships across the United States and Japan in the automotive industry. We integrate relevant theoretical concepts from transaction cost economics, organization theory and political economy to develop a conceptual model of interorganizational relationships based on the fit between information processing needs and information processing capabilities. This model is employed to collect data on 447 buyer-supplier relationships in these two countries. We empirically uncover a set of five naturally occurring patterns of interorganizational relationships. These configurations provide rich explanations of the complexity of interorganizational relationships as well as offer differential insights across United States and Japan. We discuss implications for further research pertaining to the logic and development of configurations.

## 6. Coalition Formation in Standard-Setting Alliances
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
We present a theory for predicting how business firms form alliances to develop and sponsor technical standards. Our basic assumptions are that the utility of a firm for joining a particular standard-setting alliance increases with the size of the alliance and decreases with the presence of rivals in the alliance, especially close rivals. The predicted alliance configurations are simply the Nash equilibria, i.e., those sets of alliances for which no single firm has an incentive to switch to another alliance. We illustrate our theory by estimating the choices of nine computer companies to join one of two alliances sponsoring competing Unix operating system standards in 1988.

## 7. Channel Coordination and Quantity Discounts
### Author(s):
- Z. Kevin Weng
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model for analyzing the impact of joint decision policies on channel coordination in a system consisting of a supplier and a group of homogeneous buyers. The joint decision policy characterized by the unit selling price and the order quantity is coordinated through quantity discounts and franchise fees. Both the annual demand rate and the operating costincluding the purchase, ordering, and inventory holding costsdepend on the joint decision policy employed. This paper contributes by integrating work addressing quantity discounts on inventory and ordering policies and work focusing on the control mechanism provided by quantity discounts in channel coordination. It is shown that the optimal all-unit quantity discount policy is equivalent to the optimal incremental quantity discount policy in achieving channel coordination. Furthermore, it is shown that quantity discounts alone are not sufficient to guarantee joint profit maximization. The analyses of the general models are illustrated by specific analytical results obtained for a given demand function.

## 8. When Efficient Is Insufficient: Fairness in Decisions Affecting a Group
### Author(s):
- Lindsley G. Boiney
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
Many key decisions have significant consequences for a group of people, rather than a single individual. In some cases, traditional group decision making techniques such as negotiation, voting, or compromise can be employed by the group members themselves to determine a satisfactory course of action. In other instances, however, the intervention of a central decision maker may be necessary. Intervening on behalf of a group raises additional concerns for the decision maker, one of which is fairness. This paper builds upon envy-based fairness concepts from the fair allocation literature and theories of ex ante and ex post equitable distributions from the social risk literature to develop a model for choice among limited options under uncertainty when preferences are heterogeneous. The model is therefore appropriate when other existing models are not.

## 9. Unreasonable Rationality?
### Author(s):
- Dana R. Clyman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1995
### Abstract:
This paper explores how fractional demands (the optimal fraction of wealth invested in a security) change upon exogenous changes in security returns and wealth. In the first part of the paper, the analysis is conducted in an Arrow-Debreu framework. Here we demonstrate the counterintuitive but completely rational result that fractional demands can remain unchanged or in fact decrease upon an exogenous increase in return. Furthermore, we show that this can occur without any offsetting wealth effect. In the second part of the paper, we apply these results to ordinary securities (those composed of fixed portfolios of Arrow-Debreu securities). Here we derive a complete analytical solution and show that portfolio managers should beware. Even correct information that the return from holding an underlying pure security will improve is not sufficient to conclude that one should increase (or decrease) one's holdings of any particular stock.

## 10. Accessibility, Security, and Accuracy in Statistical Databases: The Case for the Multiplicative Fixed Data Perturbation Approach
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Organizations store data regarding their operations, employees, consumers, and suppliers in their databases. Some of the data are considered confidential, and by law, the organization is required to provide appropriate security measures in order to preserve privacy. Yet a number of companies have little or no security measures. The reason for this lack of security may, at least in part, be attributed to a lack of awareness and empirical evidence about the relative effectiveness of security mechanisms. This study investigates the effectiveness of different security mechanisms for protecting numerical database attributes. The trade-off between security, accessibility, and accuracy are examined. A comparison of different security mechanisms reveals that fixed data perturbation is preferred because it maximizes both security and accessibility. An investigation of the different approaches to fixed data perturbation indicates that multiplicative method best meets these criteria.
