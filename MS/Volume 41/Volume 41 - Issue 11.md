## 2. Strategic Determinants of Service Quality and Performance: Evidence from the Banking Industry

### Abstract:
This paper focuses on an important new service management strategy: the operations capabilities-service quality-performance (C-SQ-P) triad. In order to understand what generic operations capabilities influence the strategic behavior of high performing service firms, we explore three related questions: What generic operations capabilities are among the strategic determinants of service quality? Does service quality affect market performance? How is market conduct related to the C-SQ-P triad? These questions are investigated using a stylized capabilities-based model of service quality that simultaneously assesses their impact upon a firms market performance. Several insights emerge from our research: a) generic operations capabilities affect service quality and performance, although not all relationships are direct; b) service quality know-how and innovations can be directly observed and imitated; c) the effects of technological leadership and market acuity on service quality are moderated by the absorptive capacity of employees to recognize and exploit their potential, and hence, investments in people are critical to success; d) market conduct influences the generic capabilities of the firm more than market performance, ceteris paribus; and e) total factor productivity and service quality are negatively correlated.

## 3. Constructing an Empirically Derived Measure for Customer Contact
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
This research provides an empirically derived measurement model for customer contact, a widely used construct in service management. The model was created by applying two psychometric scaling techniques, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and the method of paired comparisons, and Content Analysis, to the ratings and responses of service research experts. MDS showed that the construct of Customer Contact is multidimensional and complex. An interval scale was developed using the paired comparison methodology, and a measurement model was developed using this contact scale. The central finding was that the degree or level of contact can be measured at the episode level by averaging the normalized values of communication time, the information richness, and the level of intimacy. The uses of the measurement model include refining current research, and reevaluating past research, developing contingency models for service quality and design, and providing practitioners with a richer understanding of customer contact to facilitate service system design.

## 4. The Acquisition, Transfer, and Depreciation of Knowledge in Service Organizations: Productivity in Franchises
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
The paper examines the acquisition, depreciation and transfer of knowledge acquired through learning by doing in service organizations. The analysis is based on weekly data collected over a one and a half year period from 36 pizza stores located in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The 36 stores, which are franchised from the same corporation, are owned by 10 different franchisees. We find evidence of learning in these service organizations: as the organizations gain experience in production, the unit cost of production declines significantly. Knowledge acquired through learning by doing is found to depreciate rapidly in these organizations. Knowledge acquired through learning by doing is found to depreciate rapidly in these organizations. Knowledge is found to transfer across stores owned by the same franchisee but not across stores owned by different franchisees. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.

## 5. The Impact of a Customer Service Intervention and Facility Design on Firm Performance

### Abstract:
The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of a customer service intervention and store design on store performance within a regional food retailing chain. A longitudinal study examines the organizations implementation of a customer service intervention which utilized new service standards and customer feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the chain provided a natural experiment, since the forty-six stores in this chain represented three levels of facility design ranging from the traditional supermarket to the extended store of the future format. A theoretical model relating the customer service intervention, variations in store design, and customer satisfaction to sales performance was developed. Using both operational performance data from each of the stores and 1,537 responses from customer satisfaction surveys, a LISREL model was used to test the predictive fit of the model. The results indicate that both the store design and the customer service intervention had a significant, positive impact on customer satisfaction which, in turn, significantly affected sales performance (sales per labor hour). In addition, the customer service intervention had a direct effect on sales performance, although there was no support for a direct relationship between store design and sales performance. This research provides a theoretical basis in helping management understand how to leverage customer service for improved sales performance.

## 6. Maintaining Quality Standards in Franchise Chains
### Author(s):
- Esther Gal-Or
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
In the present paper we identify those characteristics of the markets served by a franchise chain which determine the relative incentives of the owner of the chain to monitor the behavior of individual franchisees. We find that the owner has greater incentives to monitor the outlets that serve the relatively smaller markets and those that are subject to greater fluctuations in the state of the demand confronting them. We also find that the extent of competition with other chains has an ambiguous effect on the incentives to monitor the franchisees:

## 7. Hiring and Leasing with Nonlinear Prices
### Author(s):
- Ian M. Dobbs
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
This paper examines the problem of a monopolist setting an optimal nonlinear pricing schedule in the face of consumers of unknown type who arrive randomly over time and self-select a choice of hire period. The major determinant of pricing policy is the customer arrival distribution, with the overall level of price higher than in the atemporal yield management/nonuniform pricing solution by a margin which increases with the average frequency with which potential customers arrive. By contrast, the solution is generally fairly insensitive to variations in the time rate of discount, although there is a tendency for the rate of price discount to increase with increases in the time discount rate.

## 8. A Psychological Perspective on Service Segmentation Models: The Significance of Accounting for Consumers Perceptions of Waiting and Service
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
We examine how service should be divided and scheduled when it can be provided in multiple separate segments. We analyze variants of this problem using a model with a conventional function describing the waiting cost, that is modified to account for some aspects of the psychological cost of waiting in line. We show that consideration of the psychological cost can result in prescriptions that are inconsistent with the common wisdom of queuing theorists derived according to the conventional approach (e.g., equal load assignments). More generally, our intention in this paper is to illustrate that aspects of the psychological cost of waiting can be accounted for in the analysis of queuing systems, and that this may have significant implications for the service schemes that are derived.

## 9. Increasing Service Levels in Conference and Educational Scheduling: A Heuristic Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1995
### Abstract:
This paper explores a technique for developing a conference (or class) schedule that maximizes the servicing of participant requests for sessions. Data regarding participant interests are collected before the time the schedule is generated. The problem contains two principal parts: (1) to feasibly assign session offerings to time periods and rooms, and (2) to assign participants to sections of multiple-offering sessions. A heuristic procedure that simultaneously solves both parts is described and tested. The procedure considers not only the participants requests for sessions, but also the relative importance of the various requests. Benefits of request prioritization are described. Results show that this approach can result in significantly improved participant satisfaction and equity when compared with traditional conference- and class-scheduling approaches.
