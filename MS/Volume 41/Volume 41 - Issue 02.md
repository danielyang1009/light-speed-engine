## 2. Obtaining Strategic Advantage from Being Imitated: When Can Encouraging Clones Pay?
### Author(s):
- Kathleen R. Conner
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
An important business strategy research theme concerns finding ways to minimize competition faced by the firm. This paper, however, focuses on a different set of situations: the model developed suggests that an innovator's best strategy may be to encourage clones of its product when a network externality is present. Key factors to consider in assessing whether encouraging cloning is the innovator's best strategy are: (1) the benefit to be derived in terms of added user base contributed by the clone sales, traded-off against (2) the unit sales that will be lost to the clone(s). These factors in turn depend upon the strength of the network effect and the degree to which the innovator's product quality is perceived by consumers to be superior to the clone's. The model further suggests that both the innovator and clone earn their highest payoffs when the clone takes the lead in price-setting, i.e., when the clone establishes its own price by considering, for each price it might set, how the innovator will react to that price, and the innovator, as price-follower, responds to the price the clone chooses. The paper demonstrates that the clone-leader/innovator-follower situation represents the unique Nash equilibrium in price-setting strategies. A central implication is that when operating in a network externality environment, instead of a problem to be avoided, clones may be valuable assets to an innovating firm, building up the user base for the innovator's technology by bringing lower-valuing consumers into the market, which in turn makes the innovator's product more attractive to high- and medium-valuing purchasers. Thus when the above-described conditions hold, being cloned can be more profitable for an innovating firm than dominating the market alone.

## 3. An Analytical Process Model of Two-Party Negotiations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
There has been a call to investigate the negotiation process (Gale [Gale, D. 1986. Bargaining and competition part I: Characterization. Econometrica54(4) 785806.], Shubik [Shubik, M. 1982. Game Theory in the Social Sciences: Concepts and Solutions. M. I. T. Press, Boston, MA.]), as it is felt that this would yield important insights beyond those obtained by outcome-oriented theories (Roth [Roth, A. E. 1979. Axiomatic Models of Bargaining. Springer-Verlag.]). This paper proposes a new analytical process model that captures both behavioral and economic aspects related to two-party negotiations. The proposed model, inspired by Pruitt's (Pruitt, D. G. 1981. Negotiation Behavior. Academic Press, New York.) work, explicitly incorporates concepts which are both relevant and crucial, such as the negotiators' power, concession points, aspiration level, limit, and time pressure. Based on this process model, it is possible to predict (1) conditions under which agreements will not be reached despite the existence of a zone of agreement, (2) conditions under which agreements will be reached, and (3) the patterns of the negotiators' offers and counteroffers.

## 4. Simulation Designs for the Estimation of Quadratic Response Surface Gradients in the Presence of Model Misspecification
### Author(s):

- Raymond H. Myers
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
This article considers the construction of simulation designs for the ordinary least squares estimation of second-order metamodels. Two premises underlie the development of these experimental strategies. First it is assumed that the postulated metamodel may be misspecified due to the true model structure being of third-order. It is therefore important that the locations of the simulation experiments be specified to provide protection against bias, as well as variance, in the estimation of metamodel parameters. The second premise is based on the observation that, in many applications of metamodels, functions of the fitted model coefficients (such as the slope gradients) are of greater interest than the response function. The integrated mean squared error of slopes design criterion that is implemented here addresses both premises. This criterion finds application in various optimum seeking methods and sensitivity analysis procedures. Combinations of four important classes of response surface designs and three pseudorandom number assignment strategies constitute the basis structure of the simulation designs studied. The performance of these simulation designs is evaluated and, subsequently, compared to a similar set of experimental plans that have as their focus the estimation of the response function.

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis for Base-Stock Levels in Multiechelon Production-Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
Effective management of inventories in large-scale production and distribution systems requires methods for bringing model solutions closer to the complexities of real systems. Motivated by this need, we develop simulation-based methods for estimating sensitivities of inventory costs with respect to policy parameters. These sensitivity estimates are useful in adjusting optimal parameters predicted by a simplified model to complexities that can be incorporated in a simulation.

## 6. Modeling Strategic Investment Decisions Under Sequential Technological Change
### Author(s):
- Suresh K. Nair
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
Strategic decisions to invest in new equipment are critical not only because of the large initial capital costs incurred but even more importantly because they affect future unit production costs, revenues, and the ability of the firm to perform operations that were not possible earlier. Thus these decisions determine the very competitiveness of the firm. Further, decisions regarding the choice of technology are very expensive to correct if incorrect decisions are identified. These decisions have become increasingly urgent and complex because the state of the art in technology is changing rapidly. However, many models available for evaluating these decisions are either too complex and inefficient or too restrictive in the number, types, and the way appearance of future technologies is modeled.

## 7. First-Strike Stability in a Multipolar World
### Author(s):
- Melvin Best
- Jerome Bracken
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
First-strike stability in a multipolar world measures the incentives of all major nuclear weapon countries, in all possible coalitions, to refrain from preemptive attack. The analysis integrates the interactions of offensive weapon arsenals, vulnerable offensive weapons within these arsenals, defensive weapons, and value targets reflecting the national assets at stake. In the previously-dominant bipolar paradigm, when the United States and the Soviet Union possessed almost all of the strategic nuclear weapons in the world, first-strike stability was an important criterion for assessing defensive deployments of the two sides, without consideration of any other countries. In the emerging multipolar world, however, the United States and Russia are dramatically reducing their offensive forces, and the offensive arsenals of Britain, France, and China are becoming relatively more important. Also, proliferation of medium-range ballistic missiles to other countries capable of attacking Russia, Britain, France, and China; but not necessarily the United States (due to range limitations), greatly complicates the overall situation. The main thrust of this paper is to investigate the first-strike stability implications of the deployment of strategic defenses by the United States and Russia. The principal finding is that in a multipolar world first-strike stability increases with the deployment of small to medium sized strategic defenses whereas in a bipolar world it usually decreases. Although the incentives for the United States and Russia to preempt increase, the incentives of the other countries decrease, with the combined effect over all coalitions of decreasing the incentive to preempt.

## 8. Model Selection Criteria: An Investigation of Relative Accuracy, Posterior Probabilities, and Combinations of Criteria
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
We investigate the performance of empirical criteria for comparing and selecting quantitative models from among a candidate set. A simulation based on empirically observed parameter values is used to determine which criterion is the most accurate at identifying the correct model specification. The simulation is composed of both nested and nonnested linear regression models. We then derive posterior probability estimates of the superiority of the alternative models from each of the criteria and evaluate the relative accuracy, bias, and information content of these probabilities. To investigate whether additional accuracy can be derived from combining criteria, a method for obtaining a joint prediction from combinations of the criteria is proposed and the incremental improvement in selection accuracy considered.

## 9. The Finite Horizon Nonstationary Stochastic Inventory Problem: Near-Myopic Bounds, Heuristics, Testing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
Nonstationary stochastic periodic review inventory problems with proportional costs occur in a number of industrial settings with seasonal patterns, trends, business cycles, and limited life items. Myopic policies for such problems order as if the salvage value in the current period for ending inventory were the full purchase price, so that information about the future would not be needed. They have been shown in the literature to be optimal when demand is increasing over time, and to provide upper bounds for the stationary finite horizon problem (and in some other situations). Some results are also known, given special salvaging assumptions, about lower bounds on the optimal policy which are near-myopic. Here analogous but stronger bounds are derived for the general finite horizon problem, without such special assumptions. The best upper bound is an extension of the heuristic used by industry for some years for end of season (EOS) problems; the lower bound is an extension of earlier analytic methods. Four heuristics were tested against the optimal obtained by stochastic dynamic programming for 969 problems. The simplest heuristic is the myopic heuristic itself: it is good especially for moderately varying problems without heavy end of season salvage costs and averages only 2.75% in cost over the optimal. However, the best of the heuristics exceeds the optimal in cost by an average of only 0.02%, at about 0.5% of the computational cost of dynamic programming.

## 10. Risk-Pooling Along a Fixed Delivery Route Using a Dynamic Inventory-Allocation Policy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
This paper examines static and dynamic policies for replenishing and allocating inventories amongst N retailers located along a fixed delivery route. Each retailer faces independent, normally-distributed period demand and incurs a proportional holding or backorder cost on end-of-period net-inventory. A warehouse places a system-replenishment order every m periods which is received after a fixed leadtime of T periods. Immediately upon receipt, a delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse with the system-replenishment quantity and travels to the retailers along a fixed route with fixed leadtimes between successive retailers. The warehouse holds no inventory. Under the static policy, allocations are determined for all retailers simultaneously at the moment the delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse. Under the dynamic policy, allocations are determined sequentially upon arrival of the delivery vehicle at each retailer. Our major analytical results, under appropriate dynamic (static) allocation assumptions, are: (1) optimal allocations under each policy involve bringing each retailer's normalized-inventory to a corresponing normalized system inventory; (2) optimal system replenishments are base-stock policies; (3) the minimum expected cost per cycle of dynamic (static) policy can be derived from an equivalent dynamic (static) composite retailer. Given this, we prove that the risk-pooling incentivea simple measure of the benefit from adopting dynamic allocation policiesis always positive. Our simulation tests confirm that dynamic allocation policies yield lower costs than static policies, regardless of whether or not their respective allocation assumptions are valid. However, the magnitude of the cost savings is very sensitive to some system parameters.

## 11. Robust Scheduling to Hedge Against Processing Time Uncertainty in Single-Stage Production
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1995
### Abstract:
Schedulers confronted with significant processing time uncertainty often discover that a schedule which is optimal with respect to a deterministic or stochastic scheduling model yields quite poor performance when evaluated relative to the actual processing times. In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures. Extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.
