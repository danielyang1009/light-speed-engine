## 1. Decision Analytic Networks in Artificial Intelligence

### Abstract:
Researchers in artificial intelligence and decision analysis share a concern with the construction of formal models of human knowledge and expertise. Historically, however, their approaches to these problems have diverged. Members of these two communities have recently discovered common ground: a family of graphical models of decision theory known as influence diagrams or as belief networks. These models are equally attractive to theoreticians, decision modelers, and designers of knowledge-based systems. From a theoretical perspective, they combine graph theory, probability theory and decision theory. From an implementation perspective, they lead to powerful automated systems. Although many practicing decision analysts have already adopted influence diagrams as modeling and structuring tools, they may remain unaware of the theoretical work that has emerged from the artificial intelligence community. This paper surveys the first decade or so of this work.

## 2. Risk, Return, and Utility
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
Expected utility theory is widely acknowledged to be a rational approach to making decisions involving risk. Yet the methodology gives no explicit role to measures of risk and return. In this paper we identify those families of utility functions that are compatible with a risk-return interpretation. From these families we deduce utility-compatible measures of risk.

## 3. Noise and Learning in Semiconductor Manufacturing
### Author(s):
- Roger E. Bohn
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
Rapid technological learning is critical to commercial success in VLSI semiconductor manufacturing. This learning is done through deliberate activities, especially various types of experimentation. Such experiments are vulnerable to confounding by process noise, caused by process variability. Therefore plants with low noise levels can potentially learn more effectively than high noise plants.

## 4. Quoting Customer Lead Times
### Author(s):
- Izak Duenyas
- Wallace J. Hopp
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of quoting customer lead times in a manufacturing environment under a variety of modeling assumptions. First, we examine the case where capacity is infinite. For this case, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal lead time quote. Second, we consider the case where capacity is finite and the firm processes jobs in first-come-first-served (FCFS) order. We prove the optimality of different forms of control limit policies for the situations where the lead time is dictated by the market and where firms are able to compete on the basis of lead time. Finally, we consider the case where the firm may choose to schedule jobs in other than FCFS order and give conditions under which the optimal due-date-quoting/order-scheduling policy will process jobs in earliest due date (EDD) order.

## 5. Efficient Estimation of Arc Criticalities in Stochastic Activity Networks
### Author(s):
- R. A. Bowman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
An algorithm is described for estimating arc and path criticalities in stochastic activity networks by combining Monte Carlo simulation with exact analysis conditioned on node release times. These estimators are proved to be unbiased and to have lower variance than the corresponding standard Monte Carlo estimators. The algorithm is applied to a variety of standard and randomly generated test networks to establish that the estimators are significantly and robustly more efficient than the standard estimators when run time and statistical efficiency are properly combined.

## 6. Forecaster Diversity and the Benefits of Combining Forecasts
### Author(s):
- Roy Batchelor
- Pami Dua
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
The expected error variance of a combined forecast is necessarily lower than that of an individual forecast, but in practice there may be considerable variation around these expected values. This paper introduces a measure of the benefit from combining, the probability of a reduction in error variance, which recognizes this problem. The measure is applied to data on the forecasts and forecasting methods of a panel of U.S. economists to determine how the benefits of combining vary with the number of forecasts combined, and with the diversity in theories and techniques among the component forecasts.

## 7. A Maximum Decisional Efficiency Estimation Principle
### Author(s):
- Marvin D. Troutt
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a systematic approach to certain parameter estimation problems relevant to applied optimization models. A context-specific measure of decision maker performance called decisional efficiency is defined as a function of the unknown parameter vector. The values of this measure are considered to be distributed according to a performance density. Then a principle of Maximum Decisional Efficiency (MDE) is proposed and its relationship to the Maximum Likelihood principle of statistics is discussed. The principle is first illustrated on a problem of group ideal point estimation. Next, estimation of the ratio of ordering and holding costs in inventories managed by the EOQ model is considered. The results in both these examples are intuitively appealing, suggesting face validity of the principle. A more detailed illustration is developed for the problem of deriving a consensus scoring model for credit applicants which combines the data of more than one loan officer.

## 8. A Min Cost Flow Solution for Dynamic Assignment Problems in Networks with Storage Devices
### Author(s):
- W. Grossmann
- G. Guariso

- H. Werthner
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
The paper presents a minimum-cost flow approach for dynamic assignment procedures for networks with storage devices over time. Decision variables are diversion of flow at specific nodes and the storage of material in buffers which have to meet upper and lower capacity constraints. Evaluation of a decision is based on utility functions which are assumed to be piecewise linear and concave. The solution is based on a transformation into a network flow problem as suggested by Kuczera (1989). The temporal dimension of the problem is handled by constructing a supergraph with a layer for each time period. These layers are connected by temporal arcs. Thus the problem can be solved entirely by well-known algorithms for the minimum-cost flow problem which yield the optimal solution and determine automatically whether a feasible solution exists or not. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is pseudopolynomial, i.e., linear in the size of the network (measured by nodes, arcs, and buffers), linear in the amount of inflow, and quadratic in the number of time periods under consideration.

## 9. The One-Machine Problem with Delayed Precedence Constraints and its Use in Job Shop Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
We study the one machine scheduling problem with release and delivery times and the minimum makespan objective, in the presence of constraints that for certain pairs of jobs require a delay between the completion of the first job and the start of the second (delayed precedence constraints). This problem arises naturally in the context of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure for the general job shop scheduling problem, as a relaxation of the latter, tighter than the standard one-machine relaxation. The paper first highlights the difference between the two relaxations through some relevant complexity results. Then it introduces a modified Longest Tail Heuristic whose analysis identifies those situations that permit efficient branching. As a result, an optimization algorithm is developed whose performance is comparable to that of the best algorithms for the standard one-machine problem. Embedding this algorithm into a modified version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure that uses the tighter one-machine relaxation discussed here results in a considerable overall improvement in performance on all classes of job shop scheduling problems.

## 10. Optimal Mean-Squared-Error Batch Sizes
### Author(s):
- Wheyming Tina Song
- Bruce W. Schmeiser
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
When an estimator of the variance of the sample mean is parameterized by batch size, one approach for selecting batch size is to pursue the minimal mean squared error (mse). We show that the convergence rate of the variance of the sample mean, and the bias of estimators of the variance of the sample mean, asymptotically depend on the data process only through its marginal variance and the sum of the autocorrelations weighted by their absolute lags. Combining these results with variance results of Goldsman and Meketon, we obtain explicit asymptotic approximations for mse, optimal batch size, optimal mse, and robustness for four quadratic-form estimators of the variance of the sample mean.

## 11. Measuring Systematic Risk Using Implicit Beta
### Author(s):
- Andrew F. Siegel
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
A new technology is proposed for estimating the systematic (beta) risk of a firm's stock. Just as the implicit volatility of an asset is revealed by an ordinary call option, the implicit beta of a stock would be revealed by the price of an option to exchange shares of stock for shares of a market index. Considerable benefits would accrue to those involved with the theory and practice of finance, if and when these exchange options begin trading, due to the availability of instantaneous, up-to-the-minute, precise indicators of firms' systematic risk levels.

## 12. The Demand for Parimutuel Horse Race Wagering and Attendance
### Author(s):
- Richard Thalheimer
- Mukhtar M. Ali
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
There has been a long history of patron participation in parimutuel horse race wagering and attendance, which are major recreational products in consumer budgets. In this paper, the demand for parimutuel horse race wagering and attendance has been specified and estimated for both Thoroughbred and Standardbred racetracks in a multistate market area. The data are annual over the period 19601987. It is found that demand is price elastic in every case. Racing quality, personal income, the number of racing days, competition from a state lottery, and from professional sports (baseball, basketball, football) are all significant determinants of these demands. Both attendance and wagering are found to increase with an increase in racing quality. However, it seems that the new patrons, attracted by quality racing, tend to wager less than those who attend regularly. The presence of a state lottery is found to have resulted in a substantial loss in attendance as well as in wagering at each of the racetracks. This, in turn, has resulted in a loss in both attendance and wagering-related revenue to racetracks, horsemen at those racetracks, and state governments. Professional sports are estimated to have a negative impact on attendance and wagering demands. For example, an additional 10 days of competition from professional sports in 1987 would have resulted in a 4% decrease in both attendance and wagering. Both attendance and wagering can be increased by lowering the takeout rate from present levels or by offering more quality races.

## 13. Optimal Monopolist Pricing Under Demand Uncertainty in Dynamic Markets
### Author(s):
- Kalyan Raman
- Rabikar Chatterjee
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
We examine pricing policy for a monopolist facing uncertain demand in a market characterized by dynamics on the demand side (such as diffusion or saturation effects) and/or on the cost side (experience curve effects). Our model explicitly incorporates the impact of demand uncertainty, and thus allows us to analyze the implications of uncertainty on the optimal price path, by contrasting the stochastic policy with the corresponding deterministic policy. We begin with an analysis of the general model and then focus on several special cases based on well known demand specifications to gain more specific insights and to suggest directional guidelines for dynamic pricing decisions in an uncertain environment. In general, the interaction among uncertainty, demand and/or cost dynamics, and firm's discount rate. Thus, farsighted firms operating under dynamic market conditions with high demand uncertainty, such as high tech companies with innovative products for consumer or industrial markets, should attach particular importance to the formal consideration of uncertainty in their long term pricing decisions.

## 14. Decentralized Regulation of a Queue
### Author(s):
- Rafael Hassin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
A bidding machanism for determining priorities in a service system is analyzed. It is shown that when all customers have the same exponential service demand, this mechanism induces both the socially optimal arrival process and the service order. It is also shown that the profit-maximizing service rate in this model is smaller than or equal to the socially optimal one.

### Author(s):

- Jos Trujillo
- Asuncin Robio
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
The paper presents a simple procedure for interpolating, smoothing, and predicting in seasonal time series with missing observations. The approach suggested by Wright (Wright, D. J. 1986. Forecasting data published at irregular time intervals using extension of Holt's method. Management Sci.32 499510.) for the Holt's method with nonseasonal data published at irregular time intervals is extended to the Holt-Winters method in the seasonal case. Numerical examples demonstrate the procedure.

## 16. Note: On the Efficiency of Imbalance in Multi-Facility Multi-Server Service Systems
### Author(s):

- Debashis Guha
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1995
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of simultaneously allocating servers and demands in a service system with independent multiple facilities. We assume a fixed number of facilities and total servers which must service a given Poisson arrival stream. We also assume that service times are identically distributed and independent of the server or facility. The allocation decision is one of simultaneously determining the number of servers and the fraction of the total arrival stream for each facility in order to optimize a given performance measure. Several performance measures are considered including minimizing expected system delay and equalizing delays across facilities. Our findings demonstrate that the overall system performance improves as the individual facilities become more unbalanced in the number of allocated servers. More formally, we show that if there is a server allocation that is maximal under the partial order of majorization, then it is optimal.
