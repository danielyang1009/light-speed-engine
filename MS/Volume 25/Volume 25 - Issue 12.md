## 1. Crew Planning at Flying Tiger: A Successful Application of Integer Programming
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
This paper presents a successful application of integer programming to the scheduling of flight crews for a cargo airline. The crew planning process is discussed, the role of the set partitioning model is explained, and representative computational experience is reported. The success of this application is shown to rest upon improved problem conceptualization and decomposition rather than on any advances in solution techniques.

## 2. The New Product Problem: An Approach for Investigating Product Failures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
This paper discusses a recently developed variable selection procedure suitable when the available data have discrete components. In the context of the new product problem, a modification to the basic methodology is proposed with a view of identifying product profiles closely associated with success or early failure. A comparative analysis is also undertaken in which the new method is contrasted with the more widely used linear discriminant approach. The results indicate that the proposed methodology stands up well to the more common approach in terms of both practical and classification efficacy.

## 3. An Optimal Algorithm for Sales Representative Time Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the time management problem confronted by sales representatives. The sales representative planning his itinerary must decide the best way to ration time among the accounts comprising his territory. The time management problem is formulated as an integer program whereby each admissible call frequency for each account is represented by a zero-one decision variable. A branch-and-bound integer programming algorithm for this problem is presented. The algorithm is unique in that two integer programming formulations of the problem are used simultaneously in the search procedure and an approximation-cum-relaxation is evaluated at each branch in the search. Computational testing of the algorithm shows that it can solve many realistic time management problems optimally in fractions of a second.

## 4. Evaluation of a Heuristic for Scheduling Independent Jobs on Parallel Identical Processors
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling n independent fades on m parallel processors. Each job consists of a single operation with a specific processing time and due date. The processors are identical and the operation of the system is non-preemptive. The objective is to schedule the jobs in such a way that the total tardiness of the n jobs is as small as possible. For the case of a single processor with n jobs, there exists algorithms which provide optimal solutions. On the other hand currently available optimal scheduling algorithms for multiple processors can handle only small problems. Therefore, practitioners are forced to use heuristic methods to schedule their jobs on multiple processors. This raises questions of the following nature: Are we scheduling our jobs reasonably well? Are there other schedules with which our total tardiness can be lowered substantially? How far off might the heuristic solution be, from the optimal solution? The study reported in this paper focuses on a heuristic which can handle reasonably large problems, and yet can be simply and economically implemented. Experiments are conducted by establishing lower bounds for the optimal total tardiness of randomly generated scheduling problems. These lower bounds are then compared with the total tardiness obtained from the heuristic. It is found that the heuristic under study provides solutions which are quite close to the optimal ones. The experiments include 560 randomly generated problems that range from loose to tight in due dates, with varying numbers of jobs and processors. A nonparametric statistical analysis is presented to generalize the results.

## 5. A Metasystem Approach to Organizational Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- Walter J. M. Kickert
- John P. van Gigch
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
The metasystem approach to organizational decision-making presented in this paper is set in a control systems framework. Decision-making is approached from a control systems viewpoint. The concept of metasystem is introduced as a framework for decision-making about decision-making, that is, the structuring of a decision-nuking process and the determination of organizational objectives. The metasystem framework is illustrated by means of examples drawn from a case study.

## 6. Using Linear Programming to Derive Planning Horizons for a Production Smoothing Problem
### Author(s):
- Louis W. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
In a previous paper Kunreuther and Morton examined a single product production planning problem in which demand in each of a finite number of periods is known with certainty, and there are linear costs for holding inventory and for adjusting production levels between periods. This paper reexamines the problem, taking advantage of it being a linear program. In particular, the dual problem has considerable structure, and the patterns of variables in dual feasible solutions have interesting geometric properties that afford a great deal of intuition. The requirement of dual feasibility is a more formal approach to the marginal cost balancing notion of Kunreuther and Morton and provides some extension and strengthening of the earlier results. A proof with simplified logical structure for the Kunreuther-Morton planning horizon is indicated. Then a different kind of planning horizon result is given. These, in contrast to the K-M planning horizons, occur when future demands increase, such as at the bottom of a seasonal cycle.

## 7. Server Transfer Delays in a Dual Resource Constrained Parallel Queueing System
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Gunther
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
Simulation is used to evaluate a number of server assignment prodecures within a system of parallel queues. There are less servers than parallel single-channel service facilities and server transfer between facilities is allowed. Server transfer involves a deterministic time delay. Job interarrival times and service times follow the negative exponential distribution. Evaluated assignment procedures include, (1) rules incorporating parametrically weighted transfer times, and (2) rules permitting transfer only when a fixed minimum amount of time has elapsed. These rules have the effect of delaying server assignment. Three conclusions of interest to the practicing manager are the primary result of the simulation: (1) Increasing server transfer time increases mean flow time, flow time variance, and the percent of time the server spends transferring. (2) Using rules to delay server assignment reduces these criteria when compared with rules which do not delay assignment. A manager should consider delaying assignment when server transfer time becomes greater than zero. (3) Delaying server assignment appears to have a-greater affect on mean flow time than choosing a particular assignment rule.

## 8. Controlled Experimental Design for Statistical Comparison of Integer Programming Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Benjamin W. Lin
- Ronald L. Rardin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
Testing and comparison of integer programming algorithms is an integral part of the algorithm development process. When test problems are randomly generated, the techniques of statistical experimental design can provide a basis around which to structure computational experiments. This paper formulates the problem of constructing and analyzing controlled integer programming tests in the experimental design context and develops approaches to dealing with a number of issues that arise. Both analytic results and empirical evidence from a large experiment are employed in deriving the suggested techniques.

## 9. An Example of a Multi-Object Auction Game
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
- Robert J. Weber
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1979
### Abstract:
Concurrent auctions of several objects are traditionally analyzed as if they were independent single-object auctions. Such an approximation may be very crude if bidders have budgetary restrictions, capacity constraints, or, in general, have non-linear utility functions. This paper presents a very simple multi-object auction for which explicit equilibrium strategies can be calculated; these equilibrium strategies have several qualitative characteristics arising from the multi-object nature of the example and therefore not present in typical single-object auctions. In particular, these results suggest that the observed variance in bids for offshore oil leases is not solely due to bidder uncertainty, but also to the method of auction currently employed.
