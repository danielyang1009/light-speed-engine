## 1. Probability Models in Medicine and Biology: Avenues for Their Validation for Humans in Real Life
### Author(s):
- Jerzy Neyman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
This paper represents the text of a lecture invited by The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). In nontechnical terms it explains certain pitfalls involved in real life public health studies concerned with exposures to low-level irradiation. Two particular recently-announced studies are discussed. The first of them is the study of health effects, particularly cancer, connected with radiation from uranium mill tailings. It is connected with the enactment in November 1978 of Public Law 95-604. The second study was announced last May. It is connected with the accident at the Three Mile Island A-plant. While both studies are irradiation oriented, the validity of their conclusions requires taking into account the exposure to noxious chemical pollutants.

## 2. An Exact Hierarchical Algorithm for Determining Aggregate Statistics from Individual Choice Data
### Author(s):
- Dennis H. Gensch
- Joseph A. Svestka
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
A review of the literature from many disciplines reveals conceptual agreement that individuals choose among alternatives by comparing the attributes of the alternatives in a sequential process. Yet in almost all the published empirical work the model used is a simultaneous compensatory model such as regression, logit, or probit. The sequential choice modeling approach has been severely retarded by the lack of an algorithm to generate the sample statistics projectable to hold-out samples and populations. This paper attempts to fill this void by presenting a prototype aggregate hierarchical model, called HIARC, for analyzing individual choice decisions.

## 3. The Interaction Effect of Preference and Availability on Brand Switching and Market Share
### Author(s):
- Abel P. Jeuland
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
Observed purchase behavior is the result of the combined effect of preference and availability. A multibrand choice model of a frequently purchased consumer good is developed. The model allows for the heterogeneity of the population with respect to brand preference. It also considers that all brands are not identically distributed and are thus not equally available to the potential buyers of the product class. The model uses the brand switching matrix in order to parcel out the effect of preference and availability. It is compared with the Hendry System which also uses the brand switching matrix for the purpose of measuring brand substitution or competition.

## 4. Individual Differences and MIS Success: A Review of the Empirical Literature
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Zmud
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
Of the numerous factors believed to influence MIS success, the area of individual differences has by far been the most extensively studied. This paper synthesizes the findings of empirical investigations of the manner in which individual differences impact MIS success. Suggestions are made regarding those aspects which would benefit most from future research.

## 5. The Cost of Decent Subsistence
### Author(s):
- Joseph L. Balintfy
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
Food preference and utility measures are functionally related to the frequency and quantity of foods consumed within fixed time periods. The coefficients of these functions can be estimated by psychometric or econometric methods. Total preference or utility can be maximized subject to budgetary and dietary constraints by nonlinear programming techniques. Postoptimal analysis provides the marginal utility of calories maintained in the diet at any level of the budget. The food budget where the marginal utility of calories becomes zero is defined as the Cost of Decent Subsistence (COS). It is a unique measure that embodies all the relevant factors of human food consumption such as food likes and dislikes, food prices and nutrition in a single numerical value. Computational examples with USDA food group data are presented for two time periods a decade apart. Approximations of the CDS estimates show a marked sensitivity to nutritional needs and an increase in cost over time that slightly exceeds the change of the food price index. The applicability of the the CDS concept to income maintenance policies and volume feeding programs are discussed.

## 6. An Indirect Method for the Generalized k-Median Problem Applied to Lock-Box Location
### Author(s):
- Lazaros P. Mavrides
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
The problem of locating lock-boxes (post office boxes operated by banks for corporations) has been formulated as an uncapacitated plant location problem, for which there exist many efficient methods. However, corporations are often reluctant to establish as many lock-boxes as indicated by the optimal solution to this formulation. Hence, it is advisable to find the sequence of solutions containing 1, , m lock-boxes, where m denotes the optimal number for the uncapacitated problem. This can be done by imposing an additional constraint specifying that the number of lock-boxes to be established be equal to k, and solving the resulting generalized k-median problem parametrically for k = m, m  1, , 1. It is very unlikely that an efficient direct algorithm exists for this problem, because it has been shown to be NP-complete. An indirect method is given in this paper, using an algorithm for the uncapacitated problem to solve the k-median problem. This method would be particularly valuable in situations where an uncapacitated algorithm is already in use; by adjusting the existing algorithm as indicated in the method, the time and cost required to implement a new algorithm can be avoided. The method has been successfully applied to some 1,000 real lock-box problems. It seems to be roughly as efficient as the underlying uncapacitated algorithm. The computational experience is discussed.

## 7. Generating Pallet Loading Patterns: A Special Case of the Two-Dimensional Cutting Stock Problem
### Author(s):
- Harold J. Steudel
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
A heuristic algorithm employing dynamic programming is presented for solving the two-dimensional cutting stock problem where all the small rectangles are of the same dimensions, but without the usual restriction that the cutting be done with guillotine cuts, i.e., cut which must be made in stages from one edge to the opposite edge of the large rectangle being cut. The objective of the algorithm is to determine a cutting or layout pattern for which the ratio of the unused area to the total area of the large rectangle tends to be small. To demonstrate the method, the common problem of establishing standardized loading patterns for rectangular items on pallets is examined in detail. The algorithm is described with a minimum of mathematics through the use of several pictorial displays and a simple example. The efficiency of the heuristic is then evaluated by comparing computer generated loading patterns for 182 different size items to the loading patterns recommended by the U.S. Navy, and shown to be 10.4 percent more efficient for 64 out of 182 cases when the number of items per layer were not identical. The algorithm is also shown to be an effective aid to management both in establishing standardized loading patterns and procedures, and in communicating these loading standards to production personnel via computer generated shop paper. This type of computer design flexibility and control is a valuable management tool not only for standardizing pallet arrangements, but for carton design and consolidation, warehouse design and layout, bin and shelf stocking, designing tapes for numerically controlled gas cutting machines, and numerous other industrial problems involved with the efficient layout of rectangular objects.

## 8. Infinite Horizon InvestmentConsumption Policies
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Abrams
- Uday S. Karmarkar
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
We consider an infinite horizon investment-consumption problem in which the objective is to mmimize the discounted sum of the one period utilities. The one period utility function is assumed to be concave but may be unbounded. Both the state and action spaces are uncountable. If the average growth rate of assets is less than the reciprocal of the discount rate and if a weak regularity condition is satisfied an optimal stationary policy is shown to exist. Also the optimal return function satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming and inherits several properties of the one period utility function.

## 9. Channel Optimization in Complex Marketing Systems
### Author(s):
- Marcel Corstjens
- Peter Doyle
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
Channel optimization in multiple-channel systems is a basic problem in marketing and one which has not received much attention in the literature. A model is presented which simultaneously solves three distribution decisionsthe manufacturer's choice of channels (channel strategy), the number of outlets to operate within each channel (channel intensity), and the pricing structure between channels (channel management). The general form of this model is not solvable by conventional programming techniques because it is intrinsically nonconvex. The paper shows how signomial geometric programming can provide a theoretically attractive and practical solution procedure. The model is estimated and solved on a real-life case study and the important managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.

## 10. NoteA Critical Note on a Result by Lemoine
### Author(s):
- I. Mitrani
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
In a recent paper [Lemoine, A. J. 1977. Networks of queuesa survey of equilibrium analysis. Management Sci.24 (4) 464481.], A. J. Lemoine has derived an expression for the Laplace transform of the residence time T of a customer in a feed-forward exponential network. That expression was used to obtain the first two moments of T and the results agreed with those obtained earlier by Reich for the special case of single-server queues in tandem.

## 11. NoteSome Results on Sojourn Times in Acyclic Jackson Networks
### Author(s):
- B. Simon
- R. D. Foley
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
Lemoine (Lemoine, A. 1977. Networks of queuesa survey of equilibrium analysis. Management Sci.24 464481.) studies sojourn times in acyclic, Jackson networks as part of his survey of equilibrium results. In his paper, he argues that a particular customer has a sojourn time at node i that is independent of his remaining sojourn time in the network given that the customer transfer from node i to node j. This assumption is then used to derive a set of equations involving the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the sojourn times at each node from which several properties of sojourn times are determined.

## 13. NoteA Delegation Process for Combining Individual Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Samuel E. Bodily
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1979
### Abstract:
A delegation process is proposed for setting the weights when a weighted sum of individual utility functions is used to make group decisions. Conditions under which a unique set of weights exist and methods for calculating these weights are obtained using the theory of Markov chains. It is shown that the Pareto optimal set at each step of delegation is a subset of the Pareto optimal set at the previous step.
