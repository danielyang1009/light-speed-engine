## 1. Revising Earnings Per Share Forecasts: An Empirical Test
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Brandon
- Jeffrey E. Jarrett
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
In this study, we postulate that forecasters desire to improve their performance by studying their past forecasting errors. To improve performance, forecasters may measure their past mistakes and revise their forecasts by forecast revision techniques. In an empirical test, forecasts of fifty firms' EPS were prepared by seven forecasting models. The initial forecasts were corrected by the Theil optimal linear correction technique and a Bayesian revision adjustment. Results indicate that the optimal linear correction technique is superior to not correcting for past forecast error.

## 2. Incentives in a Divisionalized Firm
### Author(s):
- Theodore Groves
- Martin Loeb
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This paper examines the problems of coordinating and controlling divisions of a large firm. Divisions are typically interdependent and the corporate headquarters plays an important role in coordinating such decisions as pricing, allocation of funds to the divisions, and determining the level of corporate-wide research and development. One important problem is how to provide division managers with incentives both to act in congruence with the goals of the overall firm and to transmit accurate information to the corporate center so that the center's decisions may be enhanced.

## 3. A Theory of Academic Interdisciplinary Research Performance: A Contingency and Path Analysis Approach
### Author(s):
- Philip H. Birnbaum
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
A theoretical model of interdisciplinary research project performance is formulated using the contingency and single-stage multivariate path analysis approaches. The model is developed using sequences of variables identified as belonging to various organizational subsystems. The model explains performance as due to problem complexity and whether the research is basic or applied. These variables are in turn moderated by the group's perceived sense of urgency, the task orientation of the project manager, the extent to which disagreements are openly discussed, and the length of time the group remains together. The manager's role was found to be crucial in project success through his/her diagnosis of the conditions calling for task oriented behaviors. The findings presented here also indicate a major difference between industrial enterprises and research projects in the sequence with which managers respond to environmental changes.

## 4. The Strategic Role of Information on the Demand Function in an Oligopolistic Market
### Author(s):
- Jean-Pierre Ponssard
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the incentives for cooperation in market surveys among competitive firms. The analysis relies on a game theoretic model. The main conclusion is that the value of information in a competitive market exhibits a sharp decrease as the number of firms that share the information increases. Thus, the advantage obtained through sharing the cost of a market survey may be upset by the loss due to the spreading of information among the competitors. The consumer's point of view is also studied showing that market surveys are advantageous in terms of consumer surplus, a usual indicator of the consumer's satisfaction.

## 5. Judgment Based Marketing Decision Models: An Experimental Investigation of the Decision Calculus Approach
### Author(s):
- Dipankar Chakravarti
- Andrew Mitchell
- Richard Staelin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
Managerial judgment is frequently required to estimate many of the parameters of decision calculus models and the quality of these judgmental inputs may substantially affect model-based decisions. This paper suggests that if model builders are to rely upon managerial judgments in building models, research should be directed at understanding when managerial judgments will be valid and the types of biases that might be expected. A quasi-experimental design is used to explore managers' abilities to estimate the parameters of a decision-calculus model (ADBUDG) and to examine the value of this model in decision-making. The results are consistent with previous evidence of the existence of biases in human judgment. More specifically, they indicate that a manager's experience in a limited region of a nonlinear response function does not enable him to accurately predict decision outcomes or parameters in the unfamiliar regions and that model usage may, in certain situations, actually lead to poorer decisions.

## 6. Covering Relaxation for Positive 0-1 Polynomial Programs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
Granot and Hammer (Granot, F., P. L. Hammer. 1971. On the use of boolean functions in 0-1 programming. Operations Research, Statistics and Economic Mimeograph Series No. 70, Technion (August 1970). (Published in Methods of Oper. Res.12 154184); Granot, F., P. L. Hammer. 1975. On the role of generalized covering problems. Cahiers du Centre D'Etudes de Recherche Operationelle17 277289.) have shown constructively that the set of 0-1 vectors x satisfying a polynomial constraint with non negative coefficients remains unchanged if the polynomial constraint is replaced by an appropriate finite collection of linear inequalities in x. When rewritten in the complementary vector x = 1  x, the linear inequalities are those of a linear covering problem. This reduction is used here to give a cutting-plane algorithm for solving the positive 0-1 polynomial program of finding a 0-1 vector that maximizes a nondecreasing linear function subject to the restrictions that several polynomials do not exceed given numbers. The algorithm consists of solving (by implicit enumeration) a nested sequence of linear covering problems, each of which is a relaxation of the original positive 0-1 polynomial program. Each covering problem is found by adding to its predecessor a small number (one suffices, but more speed convergence) of covering constraints that are violated by the optimal solution found for the preceding covering problem. Over 200 randomly generated problems with up to 50 variables and 50 constraints were solved using our covering relaxation algorithm. The CPU time was often less than one second and has exceeded one minute only for three problems. The number of iterations, i.e., the number of linear covering problems solved, ranged between 1 and 6, while the number of covers in the largest covering problem solved usually did not exceed the number of constraints in the original problem.

## 7. NoteOn Planning Freedom: Some Thoughts About the Ideas of Van Gigch
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This Note is an attempt at showing how the problem of planning for freedom discussed in (Eilon, S. 1976. Planning and freedom. Editorial. OMEGA, Internal. J. Management Sci.4 (5) 501505; Singhal, K., V. Vyasulu. 1978. More on planning for freedom. Management Sci.24 (5) 581584; van Gigch, J. P. 1976. Planning for freedom. Management Sci.22 949961; van Gigch, J. P. 1977. A management science approach to planning freedomA Rejoinder. OMEGA, Internal. J. Management Sci.5 (1)) can be formalized in terms of so-called freedom functions which express the distribution of rights in a society. It is argued that the approach analogous to that used in Arrow's Impossibility Theorem for social welfare functions would require determining first the class of all feasible freedom functions.

## 8. NoteOn the Deterministic Demand Multi-Product Single-Machine Lot Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This note considers two single-machine multi-product scheduling problems with deterministic demand that have appeared in the management science literature: the economic lot scheduling problem and the joint replenishment problem. These problems are shown to be closely related. In addition, they are shown to be nearly identical to a one-warehouse, several-retailer inventory problem. As a consequence, any algorithm which solves one of the problems also solves the other two problems.

## 9. NoteOn the Complexity of Facilities Layout Problems
### Author(s):
- T. E. Block
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This note recognizes that not only flow dominance but also the number of facilities are important measures to determine the choice between computer algorithms and visual based methods for obtaining solutions to facilities layout problems. The upper and lower bounds of the value of flow dominance are derived as a function of the number of facilities. A complexity rating that is a function of the flow dominance and the upper and lower bound to the value of flow dominance is defined for facilities layout problems. This complexity rating is shown to provide a better measure of problem complexity than one based on flow dominance alone.

## 10. NoteOn the Merits of an Approximation to the Busy Period of the GI/G/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- V. Ramaswami
- David M. Lucantoni
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
An approximation suggested by D. Gross and C. M. Harris in their book Fundamentals of Queueing Theory for computing the busy period characteristics in the single server queue with renewal input and general i.i.d. service times commonly denoted by GI/G/1 is shown to be lacking in accuracy, and therefore quite undesirable for practical use. Incidentally, we also demonstrate how for a wide subclass of such queues, computations can be done exactly using practical algorithmic methods.

## 12. NoteCompetitive Bidding with Asymmetric Information Reanalyzed
### Author(s):
- M. Weverbergh
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1979
### Abstract:
This note reanalyzes the following problem, formerly treated by Wilson (Wilson, R. B. 1967. Competitive bidding with asymmetric information. Management Sci.13 (July) 816820): two parties have to submit bids for an object One of them knows the value with certainty, the other does not. The equilibrium derived differs from Wilson's solution and yields a simple explanation for the case cited by Wilson: the value of the game is essentially zero for the party with incomplete information.

### Abstract:
Cattin [Cattin, P. Comment on designing scientific journals. Management Sci.25 (3) 295296.] makes an interesting point in that the unstandardized comparisons made in King, Kilmann and Sochats [King, W. R., Kilmann, R. H., Sochats, K. 1978. Designing scientific journals: issues and survey results. Management Sci.24 (7, March) 774784.] do not account for possible response bias or for the fact, as pointed out in the original paper, that the three respondent groups were asked somewhat different questions. We have performed the standardized data analysis that he suggests.
