## 1. Using Optimal Policy Surfaces to Analyze Aggregate Inventory Tradeoffs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
The marginal cost information needed to implement traditional inventory models is not likely to be available in practice. The most important inventory management issues in practive involve aggregate objectives and constraints while the richest theoretical models deal with single item management. To help resolve these problems, the authors propose that inventory decisions be conceived as policy tradeoffs on a three dimensional response surface showing the optimal relationships among aggregate customer service, workload, and investment. We show that any optimal management decision must result in a point located on the surface. Computational results show that the methodology suggested can make improvements in management policy in four inventories that total more than 78,000 line items.

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
This paper provides results related to the optimal design of unpaced production lines. It has been shown previously that unbalancing an unpaced production line in an appropriate way will increase its production rate. Results are presented here which show how the optimal allocation of work between stations changes with respect to

the number of work stations in the line,

the limit on the amount of work-in-progress, and

the variance of station operation times.

## 3. Optimal Inventory Ordering Policy with Tax Payments Under FIFO and LIFO Accounting Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
This paper considers the impact of tax liabilities on optimal inventory policy through the medium of FIFO and LIFO tax valuation schemes in a stochastic environment. The relationship between inventory policy and changes in either the rate of inflation or the corporate tax rate is investigated. By using recent results from the field of perishable product inventory systems, closed from expressions for expected profit are generated for both FIFO and LIFO. An extensive analysis of die one period problem indicates the impact of each valuation scheme on inventory ordering. Optimal policies are derived for the multi-period problem where prices, costs and demand distributions vary with time. In the case of FIFO a nonstationary optimal myopic policy is generated. In the case of LIFO optimal order policy is nonstationary and nonmyopic. The paper concludes with an example which illustrates the dynamic response of order policy under both schemes. The example indicates that the cost of ignoring taxes in optimizing order levels can be substantial, and that policy obtained under FIFO may be a reasonable approximation to the LIFO policy. The benefit of switching from FIFO to LIFO is also quantified.

## 4. Multiattribute Utility Functions: Decompositions Using Interpolation
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
Methodologies developed in the last several years allow formal inclusion of two sources of complexity in the analysis of a decision problemuncertainty and multiple conflicting objectives. Uncertainty can be handled by assessing the decision maker's attitude towards risk in the form of a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Conflicting objectives may be handled by making the utility function multidimensional. A problem that then arises is in devising assessment protocols for these multidimensional (multiattribute) functions that make efficient use of the decision maker's time and effort. Mostly, such methods have concentrated on identifying structural properties of the function, such as separability, by asking questions of a general nature about the preferences and tradeoffs of the decision maker. These methods have been applied successfully on such problems as facilities siting, selection of appropriate medical treatment, optimal pest control and the evaluation of R&D proposals. The problem addressed in this paper is that of what to do about the assessment if no useful decomposition of the utility function can be identified. One possiblity is to make use of some of the properties that were most nearly satisfied and then attempt to support the resulting recommendations with a sensitivity analysis.

## 5. Less Nervous MRP Systems: A Dynamic Economic Lot-Sizing Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
The Wagner-Whitin dynamic economic lot-sizing technique has not been widely applied to real-world production scheduling problems. A frequently quoted reason is the extreme sensitivity of the solution to changes in the estimates of future values of the problem's parameters, especially future demand. This nervousness has been of great concern to users of MRP (Material Requirements Planning) systems. A solution procedure which incorporates the cost of changing the current production schedule alleviates this nervousness by considering its economic effect. Thus updated parameter forecasts can be effectively used, and the schedule will be changed only when the joint consideration of setup, inventory holding, and schedule change costs indicates that it is economically beneficial to do so.

## 6. An Analysis of the EEOCC Four-Fifths Rule
### Author(s):
- Irwin Greenberg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council is responsible for the elimination of inconsistencies among the operation of the agencies and departments that enforce Federal equal employment opportunity laws. It has recently promulgated quantitative guidelines to determine if employee selection and promotion rules have a disporportionate impact on a racial, ethnic, or sex group. These guidelines state that if the observed promotion or selection rate for any group is less than four-fifths of the rate for the group with the highest rate, then disproportionate impact will be concluded. In this paper a quantitative analysis of the guidelines is performed which demonstrates that their application in many situations can lead to large statistical errors of both kinds: type I errors (concluding that there is disproportionate impact on a group when in fact all groups have the same probability of passing) and type II errors (concluding that there is no disproportionate impact on a group when in fact there is). Thus, a large number of actual cases of discrimination will go undetected and truly nondiscriminatory practice will be erroneously deemed discriminatory a substantial fraction of the time. Type I and type II errors are presented for a range of actual passing rates for samples from two groups and three groups. Also presented, for up to ten groups, are the numbers of applicants per group required such that the expected minimum observed passing rate is at least four-fifths of the expected minimum observed rate, given that all groups have the same actual passing rate.

## 7. Another Analysis of the EEOCC Four-Fifths Rule
### Author(s):
- Anthony E. Boardman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
Federal guidelines provide grounds for determining when a racial, ethnic or sex group has experienced discrimination in selection or promotion. This paper assumes that a predetermined number of people are selected or promoted and presents a simple model that computes the exact probabilities of type I and type II errors, that is, concluding adverse impact when none exists and concluding no adverse impact when it does, in fact, exist.

## 8. The Power Approximation for Computing (s, S) Inventory Policies
### Author(s):
- Richard Ehrhardt
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
In this paper we present a new analytic approximation for computing (s, S) policies for single items under periodic review with a set-up cost, linear holding and shortage costs, fixed replenishment lead time, and backlogging of unfilled demand. The approximation formulae are derived by using existing results of asymptotic renewal theory to characterize the behavior of the optimal policy numbers as functions of the model parameters. These functions are then used to construct regressions with coefficients that are calibrated by using a grid of 288 known optimal policies as data. The resulting Power Approximation policies (formulae) are easy to compute and. require for demand information only the mean and variance of demand over lead time. Extensive computational results show that the approximations yield expected total costs that typically are well within one percent of optimal. The approximation's robustness is exemplified by analyzing its performance when statistical estimates are used in place of the actual mean and variance of demand.

## 9. The Effect of Cognitive Style and Report Format on Task Performance: The MIS Design Consequences
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
The effective design and implementation of an information system is a complex undertaking which requires management to anticipate the possible effects of different psychological dispositions and various reports on task performance. To provide information that management may use in developing an information system, a group of subjects (n = 403) were (1) classified as high or low analytic depending upon their score on the Embedded Figures Test, (2) given five reports which they ranked according to their perception of the degree of difficulty they expected each report to present in performing a task, and (3) required to answer 20 questions with one of the previously ranked reports. The five reports used in the experiment were a raw data report (Report A) and four reports generated from the information presented in Report A. Report B was a tabular report of the percentage relationship of the raw data. Reports C, D, and E were a histogram of the raw data, a cumulative frequency graphic of the raw data and a cumulative frequency graphic of the percentages respectively. Therefore, there were two groups: High and Low Analytics, five reports and one task. The results of the experiment were (1) the perceived complexity rankings (lowest to highest) for both the high and low analytics were Report A, Report B, Report C, Report D, and Report E, (2) individuals classified as high analytic outperformed the individuals classified as low analytic on each of the five reports, and (3) for both the high and low analytics task performance decreased as perceived complexity increased. The implications of these results are (1) for tasks similar to the one tested that task performance may be enhanced by assigning such tasks to high analytic individuals, (2) individuals are able to perceive those reports which are likely to cause performance difficulties, and (3) using the report perceived as least complex is likely to be a valid report specification rule.

## 10. Reliability and Inventory in a Production-Storage System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1979
### Abstract:
The reliability of a single stage production-storage system in meeting a constant known demand is analyzed. This system consists of a production facility subject to stochastic failure and repair processes and a storage facility of fixed capacity. When operable, the production facility is assumed to produce at a rate greater than the demand until the storage capacity is exhausted and then at the demand rate. Expressions are developed for the fraction of time demand is met and the average inventory level in the storage facility. Two variants of this problem are also solved.
