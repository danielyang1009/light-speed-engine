## 1. Comparing Probability Measures on a Set with an Intransitive Preference Relation
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Recently Fishburn (Fishburn, P. C. 1978. Stochastic dominance without transitive preferences. Management Sci.24 12681277.) proposed a definition of stochastic dominance for probability measures defined on a set with an intransitive preference-or-indifference relation. A significant feature of Fishburn's definition is that the stochastic dominance relation inherits the intransitivity. We propose several alternative definitions of stochastic dominance that are transitive even though the preference relation on the underlying sample space is not. The basic idea is to use ordinary first-order stochastic dominance after appropriately transforming the intransitive relation into a transitive relation. As extreme cases or bounds, strong (weak) stochastic dominance is defined to be ordinary stochastic dominance for probability measures defined on the same set after the intransitive relation is replaced by the transitive relation obtained by regarding any two alternatives that were connected by an intransitive cycle as noncomparable (equivalent). Fishburn's definition is shown to be included within these bounds.

## 2. Assessing Project Implementation Risk: A Methodological Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Successful implementation of OR/MS is increasingly becoming a concern of researchers and practitioners in the field. Research efforts to date have resulted in various conceptual models of the implementation process. While offering general insight, these conceptual models provide little assistance to an OR/MS implementor in managing the implementation process or more specifically assessing the nature and extent and resolving implementation problems. This paper proposes a project-risk assessment methodology which could assist the OR/MS implementor in this determination, pointing out the need for development of relevant implementation strategies directed at increasing the chances of successful implementation. Specifically, the methodology involves the use of a discriminant function to: (1) identify high, marginal, or low risk implementation situations; and (2) point out particular risk factors that reduce the chances of successful implementation. The paper emphasizes that knowledge of the risk factors specific to an implementation situation is essential for developing relevant strategies to mitigate their influence. It is suggested that the search for viable implementation strategies by the OR/MS implementor would lead to selective review of existing theories of implementation and their use. An illustration of the proposed methodology is provided by the development and use of a discriminant function based on case study data.

## 3. A Closure Approximation for the Nonstationary M/M/s Queue
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Rothkopf
- Shmuel S. Oren
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
Typical queues do not have constant arrival rates. This paper discusses effective computational methods for dealing with queues having nonstationary arrival processes. It presents a computationally undemanding approximate method for finding the time dependent mean and standard deviation of the number of customers in an s server queueing system with time-varying arrival and service rates. Results are exhibited for various 1 and 3 server queues with constant service rates and sinusoidal components in the arrival rate.

## 4. Optimal Pilfering Policies for Dynamic Continuous Thieves
### Author(s):
- Suresh P. Sethi
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problems of a dynamic continuous thief, such as a habitual shoplifter or a gas siphoner, who must choose the pilfering rate (which increases the probability of his arrest over time) to maximize the present value of his total expected gain over a given finite or infinte horizon. The gain function incorporates the amount of pilfering, the one-shot penalty at the time of arrest and the continuous punishment subsequent to arrest. A thief is classified as a profit-maximizer, a kleptomaniac, or a risk-averter depending on whether he considers his gain function to be linear, convex, or concave in the pilfering rate, respectively. Optimal pilfering rates are obtained for each of these different types of thieves by using the methods of optimal control.

## 5. An Approach for Long Term Forecasting with an Application to Solar Electric Energy
### Author(s):
- Rakesh K. Sarin
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
An approach is proposed that is useful for long term forecasting of market penetration of new technologies, fuel price and availability, business performance, etc. The central idea is to systematically solicit experts' opinion in the form of subjective probability distributions in making future projections. The approach has two basic ingredients. One is the decomposition of the problem so that each expert is dealing with a relatively simple situation. The other is to use modeling so as to minimize the information required of the experts. The likelihood of occurrence of the relevant future scenarios is computed by eliciting from experts the single event and the conditional probabilities. The probability distributions for the variable of interest are assessed by specifying some scenarios. A model is used to predict the probability distributions for a general set of scenarios. A study using the approach to forecast solar electric energy market penetration by the year 2000 is discussed. In this study several experts from utility companies, governmental agencies, research laboratories, and universities were interviewed. The implications of our findings to long range planning for solar electric energy are discussed. The results of this study should be useful to the planners in the utility companies and the governmental agencies.

## 6. Constrained Entropy Models; Solvability and Sensitivity
### Author(s):
- John J. Dinkel
- G. A. Kochenberger
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
The paper presents an analysis of the constrained entropy maximization model from the point of view of geometric programming. While the original entropy maximization model consists of maximizing the entropy of a system subject only to constraints that the solution be a probability measure, the models considered here contain an additional set of linear constraints. These constrained models have been the subject of a wide range of applications in transportation and geographical analysis. Using the duality theory of geometric programming, we develop the dual to the constrained model, which as in the case of the original model is unconstrained except for the positivity restrictions on the dual variables. In addition, this duality theory enables us to study the solvability of the model and the impact of changes in the model parameters on the solution. The sensitivity analysis provides approximations to the optimal solution to problems with perturbed data without requiring the re-solving of the model. This analysis is appropriate for changes in the right hand sides of the constraints, the coefficients in the constraints, and the objective function coefficients. Since the constraint coefficients correspond to the objective function exponents in the primal geometric program, the analysis provides a means of studying such changes is any geometric program. The computational aspects of the procedures are illustrated on a trip distribution problem.

## 8. Optimizing Standby Reliability Systems Having Non-Decreasing Failure Rates
### Author(s):
- Dennis W. McLeavey
- Janet A. McLeavey
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
In this article we develop a bounding procedure which is applied in an algorithm for determining the number of back-up components to include in a series system. Operating only when original units fail, back-up components increase system reliability. They also add weight, take up space, and cost money. Maximizing the reliability of nuclear power plants, ships, aircraft, life support systems and electronic instruments leads to this class of resource allocation problem. Because the procedure requires only that the rate of failure of individual components remains constant or increases with time, the algorithm can accommodate a wide variety of failure probability distributions. In applications, the failure probability for various types of components might belong to different families and this can be readily handled by the algorithm presented.

## 9. Assumptional Analysis: A Methodology for Strategic Problem Solving
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
- James R. Emshoff
- Ralph H. Kilmann
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the critical role that assumptions play in strategic planning and strategic problem forming. It attempts to formulate a methodology or systematic procedure for (1) uncovering (surfacing), (2) analyzing the effect, and (3) challenging key policy assumptions. The paper shows how the dialectical approach to strategic planning first suggested by Churchman (Churchman, C. W. 1971. The design of inquiring systems. Basic Books, New York; Churchman, C. W. 1968. The systems approach. Delacorte, New York.) and Mason (Mason, R. O. 1969. A dialectical approach to strategic planning. Management Sci.15 B-403B-414.) can put on a more systematic and operational basis such that it can serve as a useful methodology for addressing ill-structured, i.e., difficult-to-define, problems.

- R. W. Wolff
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1979
### Abstract:
Conditions are determined under which (a) the sum of forecasts of sales in market segments is preferred to a forecast of the whole market and (b) a forecast of an individual market segment is preferred to a forecast obtained through proration of a forecast of the whole market. The comparisons in (a) and (b) are also applied to the problem of forecasting for several time periods into the future.
