## 1. The Beta Distribution as a Model of Behavior in Consumer Goods Markets
### Author(s):
- John F. Stewart
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
Loyalty in branded consumer goods markets is a subject that has often been discussed in the marketing literature. Virtually no matter what definition of loyalty has been adopted, it has been found to exist. This paper examines loyalty from a different perspectivethat of an aggregation of consumers' probabilities of purchasing a particular brand, called the loyalty distribution. Loyalty in this context implies that most consumers should either have high probabilities of purchasing the brand or high probabilities of purchasing one of the competitive brands; few consumers have equally likely probabilities of purchasing the brands in a market. Another way of stating the point is that the majority of consumers are loyal and tend to repeat purchase their favorite brand while few are nonloyal and tend to switch back and forth.

## 2. Group Preference Aggregation Rules Based on Strength of Preference
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
In many decision problems, the consequences of an action may impact several individuals, and the decision may be based on the preferences of those who are affected. The rule for aggregating these individual preferences is called a group preference aggregation rule.

## 3. A Conceptual Framework for the Design of Organizational Control Mechanisms
### Author(s):
- William G. Ouchi
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
The problem of organization is the problem of obtaining cooperation among a collection of individuals or units who share only partially congruent objectives. When a team of individuals collectively produces a single output, there develops the problem of how to distribute the rewards emanating from that output in such a manner that each team member is equitably rewarded. If equitable rewards are not forthcoming, members will, in future cooperative ventures, adjust their efforts in such a manner that all will be somewhat worse off (cf. Simon [Simon, H. A. 1964. On the concept of organizational goal. Admin. Sci. Quart.9 (1, June) 122.], Marschak [Marschak, Thomas A. 1965. Economic theories of organization. J. G. March, ed. Handbook of Organizations. Rand McNally, Chicago, Ill., 423450.], Alchian and Demsetz [Alchian, Armen A., Harold Demsetz. 1972. Production, information costs, and economic organization. Amer. Econom. Rev.62 777795.).

## 4. A Markovian Queue with N Servers Subject to Breakdowns and Repairs
### Author(s):
- Marcel F. Neuts
- David M. Lucantoni
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
We study a queue with N servers, who may break down and require repair at a facility, which has c repair crews. Under exponential assumptions, this model has an algorithmically tractable solution. It is then in fact a particular case of the M/M/N queue in a Markovian environment.

## 5. Comparison of a Multi-Pass Heuristic Decomposition Procedure with Other Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Procedures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a heuristic procedure for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. Projects that involve completing a sequence of well defined activities, some of which can be done in parallel, often are characterized by capacity limitations on some resources. This means schedules generated using standard critical path methods often are not feasible. Resource leveling procedures have been developed to improve the schedule. Formulating the problem with explicit resource constraints is another, more direct, way to accommodate limited capacities. Solution procedures to this problem include simple, single-pass heuristics and branch-and-bound optimization procedures. The former are easy to apply but may yield poor results. The latter provide optimal results but require a substantial amount of computation even for small problems.

## 7. An Algorithm for a Nonlinear Discontinuous Knapsack Problem
### Author(s):
- R. D. Armstrong
- W. D. Cook
- F. E. Palacios-Gomez
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
This paper presents a solution procedure for a class of discontinuous nonlinear knapsack problems. These problems have a single linear constraint and a restriction that each variable must be either zero or take on a value within a specified interval. The objective function is separable and each term is concave within the interval. Problems of this type arise in capital budgeting and a particular application in the scheduling of pavement maintenance is given. The branch-and-bound algorithm developed to solve the problem considers an approximation-relaxation at each step. Computational experience with the algorithm and a brief overview of applications of the model are given.

## 8. A Multiple Objective Approach to Space Planning for Academic Facilities
### Author(s):
- Larry Ritzman
- John Bradford
- Robert Jacobs
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the office layout problem where existing offices vary considerably as to relevant criteria and yet permanent walls make it impractical to remodel existing spaces. The major objective of this study was the equitable reassignment of 144 offices to 289 faculty and staff members in 6 academic departments with the College of Administrative Science at The Ohio State University. Since the building contains 5 floors and a wide diversity of office quality, six conflicting objectives have been recognized.

## 9. A Generalization of the Nerlove-Arrow Model to Multi-Firms Advertising under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Charles S. Tapiero
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
This paper considers a multi-firms advertising model under uncertainty of the Nerlove-Arrow type. It is shown (under a Markovian assumption of the advertising process) that the probability of sales for a firm in a multi-firms setting is given by a Poisson distribution with a parameter given by its market share at a given time. Using the multi-firms model developed in this paper, advertising differential games are resolved. In particular, a two-firms advertising model with concave advertising costs is used to obtain optimum advertising budgets for competitive firms.

## 10. NotePost-Infeasibility Analysis in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Gary M. Roodman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
When a linear programming problem is found to have no feasible solution, the model-builder generally has no tools for systematically determining why the infeasibility exists and what might be done to eliminate it. The assumption is made, at least implicitly, that if the model has no feasible solution, it is wrong to some fundamental way and must be corrected before it can be of use to the model-builder. In fact, the model may be quite correct as it stands, in the sense that it captures exactly what the model-builder meant for it to capture. When this is the case, discovering the absence of a feasible solution can be useful to the model-builder, and correspondingly, tools for exploring the nature of the infeasiblity can be quite valuable. The purpose of this paper is to develop a set of methods for doing post-infeasibility analysis on linear programming problems. The methods are designed to identify constraints that might be relaxed to attain feasibility and estimate the magnitudes of the required changes.

## 11. NoteManaging Sickle Cell Anemia in Zaire
### Author(s):
- Jean Lemaire
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1979
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the long term effects of various genetic policies that could be applied at a national level in Zaire to fight sickle cell anemia: the prohibition of marriages between individuals with the sickle cell trait, increased efficacy of the medical cure of sickle cell anemia, selective birth control, and eradication of malaria. We show that combined application of the last two policies would lead to progressive disappearance of the disease. The first two policies lead to disastrous effects in the long run, since the proportion of those who have the sickle cell trait would increase from the present 25%. Due to major differences between Zaire and the United States, the results differ markedly from those of Meredith (Meredith, J. 1977. Managing the incidence of sickle cell Anemia through genetic counseling. Management Sci.23 12611272.) who presented the results of a similar study in the United States in a previous article in Management Science.
