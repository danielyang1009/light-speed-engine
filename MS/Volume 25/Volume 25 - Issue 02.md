### Published:

### Abstract:
Deciding which items to include in a sales catalog and how much space should be allocated to each item is a major planning problem facing many large retailers and catalog firms. The steps in the catalog planning process include compiling a list of candidate items, developing one or several ad size strategies for each item, estimating the sales and contribution which would be realized as a result of each strategy, and then selecting a set of strategies which effectively allocate the space available in the catalog to some subset of items.

## 2. Mathematical Models of Road Travel Distances
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Love
- James G. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
Some management science models require estimates of distances between points in a road network based on the point coordinates. This paper evaluates the accuracy of a range of reasonable forms for distance estimating functions using samples of urban and rural road distances. The intent is to derive better distance estimating functions for analyzing systems with distance related performance measures.

## 3. Planning Horizon Procedures for Machine Replacement Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
This paper develops efficient forward algorithms and planning horizon results for several machine replacement models under an improving technological environment over time. The models are that of cost minimization, profit maximization, and cost minimization with probabilistic breakdowns. The conditions of the improving technological environment are stated in terms of operating costs, incremental profits, and expected operating costs, respectively, for these models. The state of technology can be assumed to improve every period or every so many periods. The conditions are fairly general and are likely to be satisfied by most improving technologies.

## 4. The Reversibility Property of Production Lines
### Author(s):
- Eginhard J. Muth
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
A production line is treated as a series arrangement of k work stations. An unlimited supply of raw production items is available at the first station, and each item passes through all of die stations in sequence. The service time for a single item at station j is assumed to be a random variable with a probability distribution peculiar to that station. In this mode of operation any station will at any time be either busy, or idle, or blocked. A measure of the productivity of such a line is its mean production rate r. It has been conjectured that the production rate remains invariant under reversal of the production line. Line reversal means that every item passes through the stations in the reverse order, that is, beginning with station k and ending with station 1. A general proof of the reversibility property is given. First it is shown that with predetermined service times the total time required to process n dissimilar items through k dissimilar stations does not change when the order of the stations and the order of the items is reversed. Then it is shown for the stochastic case that the order of the items does not affect the production rate.

## 5. An Application of the Blin-Whinston Algorithm for Resolving Fuzzy Group Preferences
### Author(s):
- Earle Steinberg
- Dan Rinks
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
Important decisions regarding governmental expenditures for the public welfare require accurate assessment of preferences of the citizenry as one input. Often, strong disagreement exists regarding relative merit of various projects competing for limited resources. This paper proposes a procedure for establishing a complete social preference ordering on the set of alternative projects when the group preference is fuzzy because of individual differences. An extension of current algorithms is developed-and applied to a problem concerning public preferences for expenditures on civic projects in Houston, Texas.

## 6. A Simulation of Multiple Selection Using Nominal Group Procedures
### Author(s):
- Raymond E. Willis
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
A common decision problem involves the selection of k alternatives from a larger but finite set. Examples are the selection of personnel for a training program or the funding of research proposals. A related problem is that of screening where a large but finite group of initial candidates is reduced prior to final selection. Choices of this type frequently are made on judgmental grounds by group processes; because of the subjectivity it is difficult to develop objective criteria for choosing one group process over another. In this paper, the comparative effectiveness of three procedures for group opinion summarization: standardized scores, sum of ranks, and zero-one scoring, are studied by means of a simulated nominal group process. The analysis leads to several simple rules of thumb which should prove useful to the practicing manager.

## 7. Optimal Construction of Experimental Clusters
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
A critical issue in many marketing research studies is the creation of experimental clusters for the purpose of testing new products, advertising campaigns and other marketing decisions prior to widespread introduction in the marketplace. These experimental clusters are often called test markets, panels, and other such names, but regardless of the name, their central purpose is to allow controlled testing leading to inference to a population. Very often management wishes the experimental clusters to be matched on ratios reflecting change over time, comparative competitive position, etc. This paper examines Has problem of constructing such experimental clusters when cluster composition is measured by several ratios and the optimal construction would yield clusters with ratios as close as possible to those of the population. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to obtain optimal solutions through the solution of a mixed-integer linear programming problem which serves as a surrogate for the nonlinear formulation of the problem. An illustration of the successful application of this procedure is shown.

## 8. Exceptional PaperADVISOR 2: Modeling the Marketing Mix Decision for Industrial Products
### Author(s):
- Gary L. Lilien
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of the ADVISOR 2 study, aimed at providing an understanding of and guidance for marketing mix decisions for industrial products. The study involved 22 companies and 131 products. Although cross-sectional in nature, justification is presented for using the descriptive results as guidelines for marketing mix decisions. Models are presented for advertising expenditures, marketing expenditures, marketing budget allocations, year-to-year changes in advertising spending and for selection of distribution channels.

## 9. NoteA Single Server Queue with Constant Service Time and Restricted Accessibility
### Author(s):
- Per Hokstad
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1979
### Abstract:
A queuing system has restricted accessibility if not every customer is admitted to the system. In this paper a single server queuing system is studied, where the arriving customers are rejected if their waiting plus service times would exceed a fixed amount K. The arrivals follow a Poisson process. In this case an equation for the stationary waiting time distribution is given. The explicit solution of this equation is obtained, when the service time is assumed to be constant. For this model the queue length distribution is also easily derived. It is observed that the queue with finite waiting room is a special case of this model.
