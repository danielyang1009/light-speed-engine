## 1. Estimating Service Territory Size
### Author(s):
- Stephen A. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of allocating personnel to provide service that involves travel to demand locations distributed over a geographical area. Assuming that each individual server will be responsible for demand in a certain territory on a first come first served basis, formulas are determined for estimating the appropriate area per person. Demands for service are assumed to be Poisson arrivals with their locations distributed uniformly over the territory. Service time consists of travel to the call location plus on-site service time, which can be any random variable with known mean and variance. Area per server is determined as a function of call arrival rate, desired average response time, and service time parameters. Appropriate applications for the models are identified and discussed.

## 2. Learning Curves, Production Rate, and Program Costs
### Author(s):
- Norman Keith Womer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
This paper deals with a model of the firm engaged in production to order. Models of this situation frequently conclude that the size of the order and production rate each influence the costs of production. Despite this fact, empirical work on production costs focus almost exclusively on either production rate or the size of the order as explainers of variations in costs. In this paper, a model is developed which is consistent with both these facts. The model permits production rate to be a decision variable in the manufacturer's production planning. The model is solved for an optimal production plan which requires production rate to change throughout the life of the program. The planning situation, where alternative order sizes are considered, is then contrasted with the production situation, where unit costs are related to cumulative output given a production plan. This approach provides guidance for the use of data on past programs in the estimation of cost functions and the evaluation of future production plans.

## 3. The Computation of Optimal Control Limits for a Queue with Batch Services
### Author(s):
- Howard J. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
We study the optimal control of a queueing system with Poisson input and a server capable of serving an infinite number of customers per batch. It is known that the optimal type of control policy is a control limit policy: service should begin if and only if the number of waiting customers is at least as large as some control limit. Our objective is to find the control limit that minimizes the long run average cost of waiting and service charges. We determine the cost as a function of the control limit, present properties of the cost function and optimal control limit, present easily computable upper and lower bounds for the optimal control limit and an algorithm for finding the optimal control limit.

## 4. Cluster Analysis: An Application of Lagrangian Relaxation
### Author(s):
- John M. Mulvey
- Harlan P. Crowder
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
This paper presents and tests an effective optimization algorithm for clustering homogeneous data. The algorithm iteratively employs a subgradient method for determining lower bounds and a simple search procedure for determining upper bounds. The overall objective is to assign n objects to m mutually exclusive clusters such that the sum of the distances from each object to a designated cluster median is minimum. The model represents a special case of the uncapacitated facility location and m-median problems. This technique has proven efficient for examples with n  200 (i.e., the number of 0-1 variables  40,000); computational experiences with 10 real-world clustering applications are provided. A comparison with a hierarchical agglomerative heuristic, the minimum squared error method, is included. It is shown that the optimization algorithm is an effective solution technique for the homogeneous clustering problem, and also a good method for providing tight lower bounds for evaluating the quality of solutions generated by other procedures.

## 5. An Analytic Framework for Evaluating Rolling Schedules
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
- David W. Peterson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
A rolling schedule is formed by solving a multi-period problem and implementing only the first period's decisions; one period later the multi-period model is updated and the process repeated. In this paper, we provide a general framework for analyzing rolling schedules, and we examine analytically a fundamental quadratic-cost model for the effects of such factors as the length of the planning interval, the uncertainty in forecasts, and the periodicity of demand. For the quadratic model our main result is that cost performance improves monotonically as the planning horizon is lengthened. We also find that the use of terminal conditions in the multi-period model can dramatically improve rolling schedule performance.

## 7. A Simulation Study of Predictable Due-Dates
### Author(s):
- James K. Weeks
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation study of assigning attainable or predictable due-dates in hypothetical labor and machine constrained job shop settings of varying size and structure. Several predictable due-date assignment rules are developed based on conditional estimates of individual job flow time derived from initial simulation runs. Mean lateness, mean earliness and mean missed due-dates are used as measures of shop performance to compare the various predictable due-date rules under conditions of varying dispatching rules and shop size and structure.

## 8. An Inventory Model with Full Load Ordering
### Author(s):
- Katarzyna Iwaniec
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
We consider a discrete review, single product, dynamic inventory model with stochastic demands. The ordering cost is assumed to consist of a linear purchase cost and a cost K for each vehicle used. We examine the simple policy: If the stock level at the beginning of period n does not exceed some critical number Tn, order the smallest number of full vehicle loads which will raise the inventory level just above Tn. If the stock level is above Tn do not order. Conditions ensuring that this full load ordering rule minimizes total expected cost are given. We prove that the sequence of critical numbers T1, T2,  is bounded and nondecreasing and we find a limiting value T that characterizes an optimal infinite horizon policy. The conditions include typical assumptions, such as the convexity and differentiability of the expected one period holding and shortage cost. The most interesting condition involves the variation in the demand distribution over intervals of length equal to the vehicle capacity. As one would expect, it is satisfied if capacity is small or K is large. The case of exponential demand and linear holding and shortage costs is treated. In this situation, the conditions are easy to check and T is found explicitly.

## 9. Two-Segment Separable Programming
### Author(s):
- R. R. Meyer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
New iterative separable programming techniques based on two-segment, piecewise-linear approximations are described for the minimization of convex separable functions over convex sets. These techniques have two advantages over traditional separable programming methods. The first is that they do not require the cumbersome fine grid approximations employed to achieve high accuracy in the usual separable programming approach. In addition, the new methods yield feasible solutions with objective values guaranteed to be within any specified tolerance of optimality. In computational tests with real-world problems of up to 500 nonlinear variables the approach has exhibited rapid convergence and yielded very close bounds on the optimal value.

## 10. The Cut Search Algorithm with Arc Capacities and Lower Bounds
### Author(s):
- Steve Phillips, Jr.
- Mohamed I. Dessouky
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1979
### Abstract:
This paper presents a computational procedure for solving maximal flow problems in flow networks subject to positive upper bound or capacity constraints and lower bound restrictions that are equal to or greater than zero. This procedure, referred to as the cut search algorithm, locates directly the minimal cut in a flow network structure. The algorithm not only has demonstrated computational efficiency over the existing out-of-kilter procedure, but also it provides a direct solution routine for project time/cost tradeoff problems and other network cut based problem situations in which the restricting arcs of the network formulation must be located.
