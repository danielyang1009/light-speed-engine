## 1. The Use of Optimization Models in Public-Sector Planning
### Author(s):
- E. Downey Brill, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
When applied to public-sector planning, traditional least-cost optimization models and their offspring, contemporary multiobjective models, have often been developed under the optimistic philosophy of obtaining the answer. Frequently, such models are not very useful because there is a multitude of local optima, which result from wavy indifference functions, and because important planning elements are not captured in the formulations. Omitted elements, in fact, may imply that an optimal planning solution lies within the inferior region of a multiobjective analysis instead of along the noninferior frontier. The role of optimization methods should be re-thought in full recognition of these limitations and of the relevant planning process. They should be used to generate planning alternatives and to facilitate their evaluation and elaboration; they should also be used to provide insights and serve as catalysts for human creativity. As illustrated by recent examples, these roles may require the use of several models as well as new types of optimization formulations and modified algorithms and computer codes.

## 2. Advocacy and Objectivity in Science
### Author(s):
- J. Scott Armstrong
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
Three strategies for scientific research in management are examined: advocacy, induction, and multiple hypotheses. Advocacy of a single dominant hypothesis is efficient, but biased. Induction is not biased, but it is inefficient The multiple hypotheses strategy seems to be both efficient and unbiased. Despite its apparent lack of objectivity, most management scientists use advocacy. For example, 2/3 of the papers published in a sampling of issues of Management Science (19551976) used advocacy. A review of the published empirical evidence indicates that advocacy reduces the objectivity of the scientists. No evidence was found to suggest that this lack of objectivity could be overcome by a marketplace for ideas (i.e., publication for peer review). It is recommended that the method of multiple hypotheses be used.

## 3. The Adoption Time Period for Some Transportation Innovations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
Six transportation firms (one in each mode) participated in an exploratory study to investigate factors that influence the time lag in decision making over the adoption and implementation stages for innovation. For a sample of 32 innovations, the single best predictor of the amount of time required to progress from one stage of the decision-making process to the next was the cost of the innovation (R2 = 0.23, p < 0.01), and a total of four valid predictors (cost, complexity, of the innovation, organizational risk-taking climate, and union reaction) account for about 42% of the variance (R2) in the innovation and adoption time period. A recursive, multi-stage path model was constructed and in general it was found that secondary innovation attributes act as intervening variables for the influence of climate, union reaction, and government regulation and intervention on the innovation and adoption time period.

## 4. Participation Rates in Government Transfer Programs: Application to Housing Allowances
### Author(s):
- C. Peter Rydell
- John E. Mulford
- Lawrence W. Kozimor
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
A general model of participation in a transfer program is developed and applied to data obtained from housing allowance programs in Brown County, Wisconsin and St. Joseph County, Indiana. Estimates of the parameters of the model are obtained from pooled data for the two sites, and the fitted model is used to estimate the equilibrium level of participation and the time required to reach it.

## 5. Does Lag Structure Really Matter in Optimizing Advertising Expenditures?
### Author(s):
- Alain V. Bultez
- Philippe A. Naert
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
In this article, we examine whether a better econometric specification of the sales-advertising relationship leads to significantly improved decisions. Extending the pioneering work of Nerlove and Arrow, we analyze the sensitivity of the discounted profit flow to the dynamics of advertising. On the basis of a generalized variant of their constant-elasticity model, we compare various lag structures, and derive the corresponding decision rules to determine the optimal advertising budget.

## 6. Candidate to Job Allocation Problem with a Lexicographic Objective
### Author(s):
- J. Cramer
- M. A. Pollatschek
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
Allocation of candidates to jobs is required in a situation where each candidate can only be allocated to certain jobs, and every job's length decreases as more candidates are allocated to it. The objective is to minimize the ranked length vector, which is derived by arranging the job-lengths in nonincreasing order, in the lexicographic sense. Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are derived, and an algorithm for obtaining optimal allocations is presented, along with computational experience.

## 7. Turnpike Results for Single Location Capacity Expansion
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Smith
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of selecting capacity additions from a finite set of possible facility sizes to meet demand at a single location over an infinite horizon. The problem is motivated and illustrated by an application to the planning for the deployment of long haul transmission facilities in the nationwide intercity telephone network. Under the assumption that demand grows at an increasing rate, taken to be exponential for purposes of exposition, we prove a turnpike theorem which characterizes the optimal policy as one in which the least average cost facility is eventually the only optimal facility type installed over the infinite horizon. This structural result, together with an efficient algorithm for solving the finite horizon problem, which has been implemented in a facilities network planning tool known as OFNPS, leads to a constructive algorithm for finding the optimal first facility for the infinite horizon problem. The approach avoids the end of study effects inherent in a finite horizon approach to the problem.

## 8. Effects of Alternate Information Structures in a Decomposed Organization: A Laboratory Experiment
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey H. Moore
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
The literature on the deomposition of mathematical programs as models for organizational design and resource allocation in decentralized organizations is extensive. Although models differ in detail, all conceptualize the allocation problem as a multi-level managerial coordination procedure, involving local (divisional) and global (organization-wide) resources, in which informational automony is to be maintained. That is, coordination of resource usage by relatively autonomous divisions is to be effected in these models without any one agent in the organization accumulating complete knowledge of the technical resource transformations, payoff or cost coefficients and detailed plans that divisions utilize in converting resources to useful ends. Unfortunately there has been little empirical investigation into the implementational problems of applying these models in decentralized organizations.

## 9. NoteEffects of Centralization on Expected Costs in a Multi-Location Newsboy Problem
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Eppen
### Published:
- 1 May 1979
### Abstract:
This paper concerns a multilocation newsboy problem with normal demand at each location and identical linear holding and penalty cost functions at each location. Consolidation of demand from several facilities is considered, and an expression is derived for the resulting expected holding and penalty costs as a function of the demand parameters for each location (means, variances, and correlation coefficients). The expression is used to demonstrate that (i) the expected holding and penalty costs in a decentralized system exceed those in a centralized system; (ii) the magnitude of the saving depends on the correlation of demands; and (iii) if demands are identical and uncorrelated, the costs increase as the square root of the number of consolidated demands.
