## 1. Airline Safety: Some Empirical Findings
### Author(s):
- Arnold Barnett
- Michael Abraham
- Victor Schimmel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
We consider the fatal accident records of 58 major world airlines, and in particular try to compare appropriately the safety records of airlines whose route structures overlap and which thus compete for passengers. We separately review data about the 18 principal U.S. domestic airlines and 40 major international flag carriers. A good part of effort involves trying to develop sensible measures of safety performance, and considering differences between airlines that might make misleading the direct comparison of their accident rates.

## 2. A Competitive Pricing Model
### Author(s):
- Hani I. Mesak
- Richard C. Clelland
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
This paper is principally concerned with the development of a competitive pricing model aimed at predicting the impact of a vector of price increases on sales of a given brand of a low priced, frequently purchased product. The model has its base in a set of assumptions describing the purchasing behavior of the individual consumer. A method for testing the model against empirical data is described and illustrated. The competitive pricing model is found to perform somewhat better than a simple regression model in the application reported.

## 3. ISMS: Computer-Aided Analysis for Design of Decision-Support Systems
### Author(s):
- James V. Hansen
- Lynn J. McKell
- Lester E. Heitger
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
This paper demonstrates concepts, collectively termed interpretive structural modeling, which can aid in the development of decision-support systems through: (1) creating a structure which helps identify the presence or absence of information necessary for decision-making; (2) providing a convenient framework for evaluating control subsystems; (3) defining levels in the system hierarchy; (4) specifying subsystems at each level, and (5) facilitating user participation in the design process.

## 4. Fire Loss Reduction: Fire Detectors vs. Fire Stations
### Author(s):
- Jonathan Halpern
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
This paper develops a method for comparing the cost effectiveness of two ways of improving the fire protection in a community: the installation of detection-alarm systems (DAS) in dwellings and the addition of fire companies. The method is developed from a number of relatively simple models and assumptions. One is a relationship that predicts average travel time from the number of covered fire stations and the size of the area being served. A second is a set of regressions of the percentage of the property value destroyed vs. response time for five classes of fires in one- and two-family homes. And a third is the effect of installing detection-alarm systems on the distribution of fires among the five classes at the time of detection.

## 5. A Capacitated Bottleneck Facility Location Problem
### Author(s):
- P. M. Dearing
- F. C. Newruck
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of locating capacitated facilities to meet customer demands. The objective of the problem considers both a bottleneck transportation cost and a total cost of opening facilities. The structure of the problem is similar to that of the total cost capacitated facility location problem. Problems with a bottleneck objective function are solved via a Lagrangean relaxation.

## 6. MustA Multiple Solutions Technique for Balancing Single Model Assembly Lines
### Author(s):
- E. M. Dar-El
- Y. Rubinovitch
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
Research on single-model assembly line balancing has produced several good algorithms for solving large problems. All these algorithms, however, generate just one solution to the balancing problem. With these, line designers wishing to investigate alternative station combinations of work elements are forced to do so manually. This paper concerns an algorithm (MUST) which generates alternative solutions of equal quality for single-model assembly line balancing problems. The method is based on the Mansoor-Yadin algorithm and in its optimum seeking form, MUST generates all existing optimal balances in a single pass. Three heuristics, used singularly or together, are introduced for solving the larger balancing problems. These are designed to produce about 100 different balance solutions of equal quality at each pass. MUST has been successfully used in balancing assembly lines having up to 140 work elements with widely differing precedence structures. A comparison of this method with MALB, one of the most efficient known heuristic methods, results in MUST dominating or equalling MALB in every case. Reasonable computation times (average 125.4 sec.IBM 370/168) and core usage are achieved through the use of advanced computation methods.

## 7. Binomial Searching for a Random Number of Multinomially Hidden Objects
### Author(s):
- George Kimeldorf
- Furman H. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
Suppose N objects are hidden in m boxes where m is known and N is unknown; for example, suppose that we are hunting for defects (objects) in a system having several components (boxes). Let p = (p1, p2, ) denote the probability distribution of N where pn = P(N = n). The objects are independently placed in the boxes such that the probability that any particular object is placed in box j is j. Each time box j is searched we pay cost cj > 0, and if x objects are in box j when it is about to be searched, the distribution of the number of objects removed is binomial with parameters x and j. The numbers 1, , m and costs c1, , cm are known and the initial state (p, ) is given where  = (1, , m). Let T be the (random) total cost required to find all the objects. A major result is that to minimize the expectation E(T) when in state (p, ) where p is positive-Poisson with parameter  > 0 (Pn = e n/(n!(1  e) for n = 1, 2, ), it is optimal to search a box with maximal value of [exp(jj)  1]/cj. Results are obtained for problems such as minimizing E(1  eT) when is positive-Poisson or minimizing a utility function of the total number of searches.

## 8. Multiperiod Consumption and Investment Behavior with Convex Transactions Costs
### Author(s):
- George M. Constantinides
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
The effect of convex transactions costs on consumers' derived utility functions and on optimal consumption and investment decisions is examined in a general multiperiod framework. The extent to which multiperiod consumption-investment behavior and capital market equilibrium may be studied in a single period framework is discussed. Optimal investment policy, in terms of a region of no transactions, is shown to be of a particularly simple form.

## 9. Multi-Stage Production Planning
### Author(s):
- Henry Gabbay
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
The impact of poor production and inventory planning can be significant in any manufacturing firm. On an aggregate level, excessive inventories can lead to poor cash flows necessitating financing to cover operational costs while stock outs can lead to customer service problems and the eventual loss of business. Therefore managers must utilize their aggregate resources effectively while optimizing individual item run quantities on a daily operational level. This paper presents an analytic framework for a hierarchical treatment of a multi-stage linear programming production and inventory problem. The paper is an extension of the single stage case by the author.

## 10. Extended Pattern Search with Transformations for the Three-Parameter Weibull MLE Problem
### Author(s):
- Stelios H. Zanakis
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
The Weibull distribution has found extensive applications in a variety of engineering, science and business problems. A journal survey indicated that it is the third most often used distribution in the statistical literature. To use it, one must best estimate its parameters from a given sample. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the three Weibull parameters are usually desirable due to their nice asymptotic properties, but several computational difficulties arise during the solution of this bounded-variable nonlinear optimization problem.

## 11. The Optimum Span of Control in a Pure Hierarchy
### Author(s):
- Michael Keren
- David Levhari
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1979
### Abstract:
This is a model of a pure hierarchy which oversees a given number of productive units. Its aim is to minimize costs, which are the sum of wage costs and costs caused by delays in decision making. The advantage of the model is that it permits the calculation of an optimum formal structure of the hierarchy in terms of the span of control at different levels.
