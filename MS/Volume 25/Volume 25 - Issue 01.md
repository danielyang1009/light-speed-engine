### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
A procedure is presented to evaluate the appropriateness of alternative methodologies for analyzing a specified problem. This procedure is illustrated by identifying desirable characteristics of nuclear power plant site selection methodologies and evaluating the adequacy of methodologies that have been used to select nuclear power plant sites. Objectives of such siting methodologies are specified and attributes developed to measure the degree of attainment of each objective. Several siting methodologies are rated on the various attributes and these ratings are analyzed to determine the adequacy of each methodology.

## 2. Network Models for Estimating Brand-Specific Effects in Multi-Attribute Marketing Models
### Author(s):
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
In multi-attribute models in marketing, a consumer's preference for a brand in a product class is expressed as a weighted sum of the brand's attribute values. However, marketing is abundant with examples where two brands may have approximately the same attribute values but enjoy very different market shares, e.g., Coke and Pepsi may have the same values for sweetness, carbonation, calories and price but have quite different market shares; two political candidates may take approximately the same position on relevant political issues but enjoy different levels of voter support. Defining the brand-specific effect to be the component of overall preference not explained by the attributes used in the multi-attribute model, the aim is to empirically estimate the brand-specific effects for the different brands. It turns out that the estimation problems have a close relationship to some minimum cost network flow models in Operations Research. An empirical application of the proposed approach in the context of consumers' choices of different primary health care physicians in a rural area reveals that the brand-specific component substantially improves the validity of the multi-attribute model.

## 3. Locating Rural Social Service Centers in India
### Author(s):
- Nitin R. Patel
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
This paper describes experience with application of operations research techniques in planning new roads and social service centers for the Dharampur area in India. The work involved designing a road network using a minimal spanning tree algorithm; selecting the number and location of the service centers to be constructed over a five year period using a set covering algorithm; and developing a schedule for the construction of the service centers using dynamic programming. Substantial economic benefits resulted from using the mathematical models. The experience shows that operations research models can be useful in providing an objective rationale for administrative decisions, thus playing an important role in the resolution of political conflict.

## 4. Decentralization of the Capital Budgeting Authority
### Author(s):
- Ed M. Sharon
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
A conceptually new first-cut decision-aid for optimal delegation is introduced. It takes a subjective approach to capital budgeting, from the delegator's perspective. A model captures the tradeoffs between the cost of centralized (duplicated) review, and the opportunity cost and risk of having (otherwise) unacceptable projects.

## 5. Evaluating Urban Growth Policies with a Systems Simulation
### Author(s):
- Donald E. Sexton
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
Alternate policies for controlling the growth of a city were examined with a simulation model consisting of four sectors: national services, local services, manufacturing, and population. The policies investigated included restricting growth of manufacturing and/or government activities in the capital, moving government services from the capital, lowering the national birth rate, and making cities other than the capital more attractive places in which to live. This article describes the model construction process as well as the findings and their implications.

## 6. An Algorithm for Computing Serial Correlations of Times in GI/G/1 Queues with Rational Arrival Processes
### Author(s):
- C. M. Woodside
- B. Pagurek
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
An algorithm is given for computing the serial correlations of the waiting time, and of the time in system, for successive customers in a GI/G/1 queue. The method depends on representing the inter-arrival time distribution in terms of a process in class Kr (i.e., distributions with a rational Laplace transform). Thus Erlang, hyperexponential and weighted sum-of-Erlang arrivals are treated exactly, and approximate results can be found for other distributions. Computed correlation functions for some Erlang/Erlang systems are presented as examples.

## 7. Integer Programming Post-Optimal Analysis with Cutting Planes
### Author(s):
- Dieter Klein
- Sren Holm
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
Sufficient conditions have been developed for testing the optimality of solutions to all-integer and mixed-integer linear programming problems after coefficient changes in the right hand side and the objective function, or after introduction of new variables. The same conditions can be used as necessary conditions for coefficient changes to alter an optimal solution. The tests are based on cutting-plane theory, and the application of the tests requires solution of the original integer problem with a cutting-plane algorithm.

## 8. Bicriteria Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Y. P. Aneja
- K. P. K. Nair
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
In a transportation problem, generally, a single criterion of minimizing the total cost is considered. But in certain practical situations two or more objectives are relevant. For example, the objectives may be minimizations of total cost, consumption of certain scarce resources such as energy, total deterioration of goods during transportation, etc. Clearly, this problem can be solved using any of the multiobjective linear programming techniques; but the computational efforts needed would be prohibitive in many cases. The computational complexity in these techniques arises from the fact that each of the methods finds the set of nondominated extreme points in the solution space where such extreme points are, generally, many. Therefore, this paper develops a method of finding the nondominated extreme points in the criteria space. Such extreme points in the criteria space would be generally less and only these are needed while choosing a nondominated solution for implementation. The method involves a parametric search in the criteria space. Although the method is developed with respect to a bicriteria transportation problem, it is applicable to any bicriteria linear program in general. The bottleneck criterion included as a third objective is particularly significant in time bound transportation schedules. A numerical example is included.

## 9. A Hazardous-Inspection Model
### Author(s):
- David A. Butler
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the determination of optimal inspection policies when inspections have the potential of being harmful to the device under consideration. The device operates throughout a number of periods and in each period is subject to failure. Failure of the device is directly observable. Prior to failure the device enters a state in which it is functioning, but in an impaired manner. This state can be detected only by performing an inspection. Once the device is known to be in die impaired state, appropriate action may be taken to prolong its remaining life. In this respect inspection is valuable. However the act of inspecting die device when it is not~impaired may itself cause it to become impaired. In this respect inspection is hazardous. This paper determines inspection policies which maximize the expected lifetime of the device. The optimal inspection policies are shown to generally be of only two possible forms, the choice of which depends upon the model parameters.

## 10. A Heuristic Lot Size Reorder Point Model for Decaying Inventories
### Author(s):
- Steven Nahmias
- Shan Shan Wang
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider the problem of finding a good lot size and reorder point policy for an inventory which is subject to continuous exponential decay. Examples of decaying inventories include alcohol, certain types of food items, and radioactive materials. The method of analysis is an approximate approach which parallels that of Hadley and Whitin in the no-decay case. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approximation, a computer simulation is developed to estimate and evaluate the best (Q, r) policy. A comparison of the approximate and simulated policies is made for a total of thirty test cases resulting in a maximum cost error of only 2.77%.

## 11. Optimal Scheduling of Jobs on a Transmission Network
### Author(s):
- G. A. Jones
- J. G. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
A number of jobs have to be carried out on a gas transmission network every year, which restrict the transmission capacity of the network while they are in progress. There are certain pairs of jobs which must not be in progress at the same time. The network must meet a convex annual demand pattern. The problem of scheduling the jobs over the summer construction period to meet these conditions is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem which is solved by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Results and benefits to the operators of the network are described.

## 12. NoteA Simple Edge Elimination Criterion in a Search for the Center of a Graph
### Author(s):
- Jonathan Halpern
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
This note proposes a new edge elimination criterion in an algorithm whose purpose is to locate the center of a graph. The new criterion requites the same amount of information and computation but generates a stronger lower bound. It therefore reduces substantially the number of edges that have to be checked thoroughly, at a high computational cost, for a possible center point along them.

## 13. NoteOn the Maximal Covering Location Problem and the Generalized Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- T. D. Klastorin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1979
### Abstract:
In many public sector location problems, it is often desirable to locate facilities in such a way to minimize the number (or cost) of facilities while insuring tint all demand centers are within a stated maximal service time front any facility. However, when insufficient resources exist to allow die construction of enough facilities to serve all demand centers within the alloted time, the location problem is frequently restated in order to locate the budgeted facilities to serve the serviced population.
