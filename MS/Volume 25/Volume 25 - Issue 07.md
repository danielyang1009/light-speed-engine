## 1. An Efficient Algorithm to Determine Stochastic Dominance Admissible Sets

### Published:

### Abstract:
Stochastic Dominance (SD) rules are playing an increasingly prominent role in the theory of choice under uncertainty. Its application areas include stock selection, capital budgeting, etc. The theory is important because it generates decision rules which are more generally applicable to these problems than are the traditional two parameter (mean-variance) rules employed in much of financial decision making. While they are theoretically sound, the SD rules are, until now, hard to implement because they require comparisons of probability distributions over their entire ranges. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that should remedy this situation. It exploits recent theoretical results from the Stochastic Dominance literature as well as several computational techniques to efficiently determine the SD admissible set of alternatives, which contains the optimal choices for all decision makers whose preferences satisfy reasonable economic criteria.

## 2. A Case Study of Encoder Shift Scheduling under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Vincent A. Mabert
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
This paper illustrates a shift scheduling procedure for a commercial bank's encoder work force for check processing in the presence of daily work load uncertainty. The author presents a chance constraint model for determining the appropriate safety capacity, analogous to safety stock in inventory theory, to meet varying volume demands when forecast errors are present. A series of tests are conducted to evaluate the model's performance under different operating costs, forecast errors, and volume arrival rates, which are based on data collected at Chemical Bank. The results indicate this model provides low cost solutions.

## 3. Advertising Agency Compensation: A Model for Incentive and Control
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
This paper describes a theoretical model for incentive and control within the framework of the advertising agency-client relationship. This particular interorganizational relationship has been characterized by frequent disagreements, discontent and resignation of accounts by both sides. For many years simple commission schemes were the rule. Recently many alternative schemes have been instituted but have either had no effect or overly favored one party or the other and thus exacerbated the historical discontent in the industry.

## 4. The Chinese Postman Problem for Mixed Networks
### Author(s):
- Edward Minieka
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
The Chinese postman problem is to find a least cost way to traverse each arc of a network at least once and to return to the vertex from which you started. Diverse problems such as the routing of road crews, police patrol scheduling, garbage collection and the programming of computer map printers can be modelled as Chinese postman problems.

## 5. On the Effectiveness of Common Random Numbers
### Author(s):
- R. D. Wright
- T. E. Ramsay, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
The common random number (CRN) simulation technique is a variance reduction method in which policy alternatives are tested against the same random input streams. The CRN literature suggests that positively correlated input streams will generate positively correlated policy responses and, therefore, that the variance of CRN estimators of response differences will be smaller than the variance of independent sample estimators. This paper reports simulation experiments with a typical inventory model for which the CRN technique induces negative correlation and thus augments variance. The experiments also show that CRN designs which assign separate random streams to each stochastic input and hold all streams common across policy tests usually, but not necessarily, yield maximum variance reduction.

## 6. The Management System: Its Functions and Processes
### Author(s):
- J. Barton Cunningham
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
What is management? In recent years, a number of schools or approaches to management have evolved. What is rather upsetting to the manager is that there are a variety of unrelated approaches without any suggestion of their relationship to each other. Even more upsetting is that some of these approaches seem to be based on the disciplines of particular researchers rather than their ability to help managers. The study explores the rationale underlying two predominant orientations. One is concerned with the process of management, while the other emphasizes the function of management. The managerial process involves such intuitive principles as planning, organizing, and staffing. The managerial function involves arranging equipment to perform functions such as procurement, production, and adaptation. The goal is to illustrate the relationship of these approaches to each other and to specific managerial needs.

## 7. Brand Choice Inertia as One Aspect of the Notion of Brand Loyalty
### Author(s):
- Abel P. Jeuland
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
A very parsimonious first-order multibrand model of the individual consumer for frequently purchased consumer goods is developed, generalizing the zero-order multinomial model. The model incorporates the notion of brand choice inertia, which is a form of short-term loyalty. Besides the equilibrium marginal choice probabilities of the multinomial model, a single additional parameter of choice inertia is defined. A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is derived and used on individual data from a subsample of the Secodip Consumer Panel, France: 2,401 purchases of cooking oil from eighty-nine of the consumers who were in the panel for the entire 19711972 period are used. Through the likelihood ratio test procedure, the model is shown to significantly improve on the multinomial model. An aggregate version of the model is also developed and estimated by a minimum chi-square procedure on four independent data sets. It is compared with the linear learning model which has been preferred over other probabilistic models of brand choice in most empirical studies in the past fifteen years. On the criterion of the p-level corresponding to the chi-square procedure, the model is superior for data set one, basically equivalent for data set two and its special case of the multinomial model being best for data sets three and four. The model operationalizes in a simple way the notion of carryover effect of marketing actions: a short-term perturbation from equilibriumdue to marketing mix actions, for examplehas some residual effect on future purchase occasions. Moreover, in the context of new product modeling, the inertia model is in accord with the empirical observation by Parfitt and Collins of leveling-off of repeat-buying.

## 9. NoteComputation of Particular Economic Equilibria
### Author(s):

- James E. Falk
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1979
### Abstract:
The computation of economic equilibria, given specific supply and demand functions, is a well-established problem normally treated by fixed point methods or other iterative schemes which converge to a point satisfying the equilibrium criteria. In cases where there are several points which satisfy the equilibrium criteria, these methods will produce a solution distinguished only by the characteristics of the method itself and the starting point used.
