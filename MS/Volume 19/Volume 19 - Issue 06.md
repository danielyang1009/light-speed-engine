## 1. Toward a Normative Model of Promotional Decision Making
### Author(s):
- David A. Aaker
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
This paper presents a normative model of promotional decision making and reviews current literature in the model context. The model emphasizes the long-run impact of promotions and draws upon stochastic buyer-behavior model technology. In particular, a stochastic model is used to predict the level of brand acceptance obtained from a group of new triers attracted by a promotion—consumers with no recent use experience with the brand. This brand acceptance is made a function of the composition of the new-trier group. Finally, attention is focused upon the probability distribution of those attracted by the promotion, conditional on the nature of the promotion. This distribution is used to develop expressions for the expected long-term worth of a new-trier group attracted by a specific promotion.

## 2. A Markovian Analysis of a Geriatric Ward
### Author(s):
- Jack Meredith
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a specialized geriatric program in a California mental hospital by analyzing the movement of patients into, through, and out of the program. The procedure for modelling the patients' movements between states with a Markov chain is detailed and the results analyzed. First passage times, long-term trends, and stay times until death are derived as well as the associated costs the hospital must endure. Lastly, ways to simulate the effect of possible program modifications are illustrated.

## 3. The Journal Selection Problem in a University Library System
### Author(s):

- T. W. Hill, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy library objectives is examined and modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem This is done using an objective function based on expected usage as a measure of journal worth and on cost constraints which account for the scarcity of capital. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to break down the larger problem into smaller sub-problems and to generate a feasible solution. Special cases where the solution is optimal are presented and discussed in terms of their implications for the library. An example problem is presented to illustrate the algorithm.

## 4. A Methodology for Emergency Ambulance Deployment
### Author(s):
- James A. Fitzsimmons
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
An important feature of emergency ambulance systems is that the probability of any given unit being busy is dependent upon which of the other units are busy. An analytical model incorporating this feature is developed and found to be reliable in predicting the entire response time distribution for an actual operating system. A computer version of the model coupled with a pattern search routine constitutes the ambulance deployment methodology referred to as CALL (Computerized Ambulance Location Logic). This methodology may be used to find the deployment of ambulances that minimizes mean response time, as illustrated by an application for the City of Los Angeles. CALL was used to select from a possible set of 34 firehouses 14 for the location of emergency ambulances. Although the objective was the minimization of mean response time, the final deployment substantially reduced the probability of excessive response times as well. Another ancillary benefit from the use of CALL was a substantial smoothing of workload among the 14 ambulance crews.

## 5. Blood Bank Inventory Control
### Author(s):
- John B. Jennings
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
Essentially, blood banks are facilities which procure, store, process, and dispense blood. To operate effectively in the face of both random supply and random demand, sizable buffer stocks of blood are maintained. The resulting inventory control problem is an extremely complex one for several reasons: (1) both supply and demand are random; (2) approximately 50 percent of all bloods demanded, “crossmatched,” and held for a particular patient are eventually found not to be required for that patient; (3) blood is perishable, the present legal lifetime being 21 days in most areas; and (4) each blood bank typically interacts with a number of other banks. This paper presents a framework for the analysis of the whole blood inventory problem at the individual hospital as well as at the regional level, presents a realistic model of blood inventories for both the individual and regional cases, and analyzes the effects of several alternative inventory policies.

## 6. Hospital Admission Systems: Their Evaluation and Management
### Author(s):
- John H. Milsum
- Efraim Turban
- Ilan Vertinsky
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
The paper presents a holistic analysis of hospital management admission systems. It outlines control strategies which will facilitate a system's effectiveness for various organizational attributes. In particular, attention is focused on bed occupancy levels and on the stability of flows into the hospital as interacting control variables.

## 7. Allocation of Importance in a Hierarchial Goal Structure
### Author(s):
- Yutaka Sayeki
- Karl H. Vesper
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
A weighted additive utility model was used to investigate people's consistency in their allocations of importance and subsequent utility judgments, when a complex goal-subgoal hierarchy was given. In the experiment subjects allocated importance to four policies given each of three objectives and to the objectives under an overall goal. Subjects' task was to evaluate several proposals for a company's future courses of action on the basis of their contribution to the policies, objectives, and overall goal. The results showed that the model described fairly well subjects' consistency in their judgments for importance and utilities, except when they were asked to make judgments for remote, indirect goals.

## 8. An Experimental Investigation of Decision Making in a Simulated Research and Development Environment
### Author(s):
- Herbert Moskowitz
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
Information processing and choice behavior of research and development (R&D) managers and MBA students were investigated through play of a simple R&D decision game under conditions of technical uncertainty. The experimental design permitted a detailed micro-analysis of the players' behavior. The research data were collected in concert with the game's use as a training vehicle, which also permitted exploration of improved methods for effectively educating practitioners in these concepts and the assessment of the potential imposition of decision theory on managerial decision making. The rules deduced describing information processing and decision processes have important implications for training in decision theory. Significant differences in game behavior were found between R&D managers and students. The significant degree of irrational and suboptimal behavior exhibited, the R&D managers' willingness to accept the norms of decision theory as a basis of rational thought, and their general interest in the topic of decision making underscore the importance of educating managers in the concepts of decision theory.

## 9. Decision Rules in Chance-Constrained Programming: Some Experimental Comparisons
### Author(s):
- Douglas V. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
A stochastic programming model for evaluation of investment in irrigation is presented. The model reflects the complex hydrologic and economic interactions that arise from consideration of the conjunctive use of ground and surface water, the need for the provision of drainage to irrigated lands, and the use of some lands for rice cultivation. The implications of stochastic precipitation are discussed. Several decision rules for system operation are presented and discussed in terms of computation requirements and the possibility of field implementation.

## 10. Approximation Formulae for Estimation of Waiting-Time in Multiple-Channel Queueing System
### Author(s):
- Erik Maaløe
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1973
### Abstract:
This article deals with two approximation formulae for estimation of Wq<, mean waiting-time in a M/Ek/R queueing system. It is shown how Wq< for the multiple-channel system with λ = λ, μ = μ is approximately Rth part of Wq−, mean waiting-time in a single-channel system with λ = λ/R, μ = μ. A second approximation applies the exact ratio W</W− for M/M/R and M/M/1-systems to general M/Ek/R-systems This is particularly illustrated in the case of M/M/R and M/D/R-systems.
