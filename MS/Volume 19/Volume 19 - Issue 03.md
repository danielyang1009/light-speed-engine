## 1. Engineering Design Optimization Under Risk
### Author(s):
- Joel Weisman

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
Since engineering designs generally involve a number of elements about which only partial information is available, design optimization should be conducted under conditions of risk. Utility is nonlinear with cost or revenue; consequently, the enterprise's view of risk is considered through utilities assigned to costs or revenues which deviate from the mean. This is termed “risk programming” to distinguish it from previous contributions in this area. General forms of the objective function, yielding expected utility, are derived for utility functions of two types. When the total cost distribution is normal, an exact solution requiring only a knowledge of expected total cost and the cost variance is obtained. For nonnormal cost distributions, an upper bound of the objective function, requiring knowledge only of the same two quantities, is obtained. A model for engineering design, which provides both the expected total cost and cost variance, is developed based upon division of the elements of variability into several categories. With this division, a reasonable computational procedure is possible. The procedure has been incorporated into a modified direct search optimization program capable of solving large-size design problems.

## 2. Equivalent Formulations of the Stochastic Cash Balance Problem
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
This paper shows that the widely appearing “marginal cost” formulations of the dynamic, periodic review, stochastic cash balance problem are equivalent to a “total cost” formulation, as long as the holding, shortage cost, and “closing of account” functions are constructed correctly.

## 3. A Matrix Solution for the Two Server Queue with Overflow
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Disney
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
A complete solution to the two-server Markov queue in which arrivals to the second server are the stream of overflows from the first server is given. It is shown that the solution can be determined from a particular second order difference equation in vectors subject to boundary conditions defined by the problem. An example provides more details. A means of finding various marginal and conditional probabilities is given.

## 4. Solution of a Satisficing Model for Random Payoff Games
### Author(s):
- R. G. Cassidy
- C. A. Field
- M. J. L. Kirby
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
In this paper, we consider a “satisficing” criterion to solve two-person zero-sum games with random payoffs. In particular, a player wants to maximize the payoff level he can achieve with a specified confidence. The problem reduces to solving a nonconvex mathematical programming problem. The main result shows that solving this problem is equivalent to finding the root of an equation whose values are determined by solving a linear problem. This linear problem results from maximizing the confidence with fixed payoff level.

## 5. Mathematical Programming Methods of Pattern Classification
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
This survey examines eight mathematical programming models of pattern classification. The paper determines the range of applicability and computational merits of each model. The flexibility and large sample properties of the models are also discussed. We find that six of the models produce decision rules that maximize a function we call the quality of a decision rule. The remaining two models minimize a weighted sum of errors.

## 6. The Determination of Partial Moments
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Winkler
- Gary M. Roodman
- Robert R. Britney
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
In statistical decision theory, computations often involve the partial moments of a random variable. Several methods for determining partial moments are discussed, including direct calculation, the use of general formulas which apply to entire families of distributions, and the use of partial moment generating functions. Using these methods, formulas (some involving recursive relationships) are developed for the partial moments of a number of frequently encountered distributions and compared with the corresponding formulas for complete moments.

## 7. Optimal Control of a Single-Server Queue with Balking and Reneging
### Author(s):
- Joseph D. Blackburn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of controlling a single-server queue by turning the server on and off. In addition to a Poisson arrival process and general service-time distribution, provisions for balking and reneging are included in the models, yielding a variety of applications. Stationary optimal policies which maximize expected discounted reward over an infinite horizon are shown to have a simple critical-number characterization. Algorithms for computing the critical numbers are described.

## 8. A Central Limit Theorem for Present Values of Discounted Cash Flows
### Author(s):
- Edmund H. Mantell
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
A renewal process is defined to represent the present value of a stream of money payments occurring at random times.The objective is to partially close a gap in the state of knowledge regarding the properties (asymptotic behavior) of certain cashflow models, scheduling models, and inventory models, all of which can be embedded in the context of replacement-reliability theory in general. The contribution of this paper is a characterization of the asymptotic distribution of a general capitalized random variable as the time-invariant rate of discount approaches zero. The main result is a central limit theorem demonstrating that the standardized distribution of the discounted random variable converges to the unit normal as the discount rate approaches zero.

### Abstract:
The problem of unifying portfolio planning and transaction demands for cash in a single model is considered. We distinguish between portfolio selection and portfolio revision problems. Each problem is formulated as a single-period model allowing exogenous stochastic cash demands and:

## 11. Rejoinder: Direct Search Method for Finding Negative Cycles
### Author(s):
- M. Florian
- P. Robert
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1972
### Abstract:
We would like first to stress that we have not “claimed” wide applicability for this method except for the results that we have given. Our motivation for carrying out this work was to find a method of locating and tracing negative cycles to use as a subroutine in Klein's [Klein, M. 1967. A primal method for minimal cost flows with applications to the assignment and transportation problems. Management Sci.4 (3) 205–220.] algorithm.
