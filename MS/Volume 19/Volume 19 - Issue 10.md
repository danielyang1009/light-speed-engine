## 1. Preface to Management Science, Ecology and the Quality of Life
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- G. Kozmetsky
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
Most of the articles that follow are the papers that formed the Distinguished Lecturer Series—i.e., the invited, thematic series—at the XIX International Meetings of The Institute of Management Sciences in Houston, Texas, on April 4–8,1972. There are two exceptions: (1) “The ORSA New Orleans Address on ‘Compact City’” by G. B. Dantzig and (2) “A Model to Study Revenue Sharing and Account for Regionalized Economic Activity and Social Goals” by A. Charnes, C. Colantoni, W. W. Cooper and K. O. Kortanek. The former, as its title suggests, was the basis of Dr. Dantzig's plenary lecture on April 27, 1972, to the 41st National Meeting of the Operations Research Society of America in New Orleans—to which he has added “An Agenda for Research on Urban Development”. The latter paper is intended to complement “Measuring, Monitoring and Modeling Quality of Life” which was presented by A. Charnes, W. W. Cooper and G. Kozmetsky, as the final Distinguished Lecture in the TIMS series at Houston.

## 2. Technology and Environment
### Author(s):
- Herbert A. Simon
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
The solution of today's major social problems will come from more and better technology—not from less technology. For technology is just another name for human knowledge. We need to deepen our scientific knowledge, broaden our repertory of alternatives, and strengthen our technology of decision procedures. Above all, we need a more profound understanding of Man himself, for all human problems have their roots in our own nature.

## 3. Management Science, Economics and Environmental Science
### Author(s):
- Allen V. Kneese
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
Microeconomics and management science are close relatives in terms of the tools they use. Economics differs primarily in that it studies the performance of entire economic systems and major subsystems. Management science models can be expanded to examine environmental policy and the design of institutions for environmental management. This is illustrated by a quantitative model developed at Resources for the Future which incorporates as submodels natural atmospheric and ecological systems and the political structure of alternative forms of representative government.

## 4. Organization for Environmental Management—National and Transnational
### Author(s):
- Neil H. Jacoby
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
Environmental quality is the new social priority. Like previous major shifts in public values, it calls for changes in economic functions and resource allocations, and it requires new institutions for decision making and action. Criteria are proposed for choosing optimal governmental units to manage the principal environmental variables. Major gaps exist. At the Federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency should be supplemented by a new policy-oriented Institute for Environmental Studies and by programs of public education. State governments need executive agencies with integrated control over all variables. Metropolitan and regional authorities should be created to control land use planning and development. Environmental variables transcending national boundaries are now only partly managed by means of international treaties. A new World Oceanic and Atmospheric Regime is proposed to supply flexible and integrated control. The quality of environmental decisions would be raised greatly if decision-makers had available a socioeconomic model system of the United States.

## 5. The ORSA New Orleans Address on Compact City
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
The failure of urban planners, politicians, and bureaucrats to cope with urban crises and come up with solutions that work, stems from a fundamental inability to deal with complexity. The urban environment is complex, inter-related, highly dynamic. Nothing less than a total-system approach using the tools of mathematical and computer simulation models can hope to attack the problems of urban over growth.

## 6. Management Science, Ecology, and the Quality of Life: The Law and the Legal Process
### Author(s):
- Michael A. Duggan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
The Law and the Legal Process are important ingredients in any attempt to insert “Quality of Life” inputs within an environmental control system. This paper discusses the interface between Environmental Concern and the Legal Process. It does not focus on current legislative enactments and proposals but rather upon the ontological constraints.

## 7. Measuring, Monitoring and Modeling Quality of Life
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- G. Kozmetsky
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
Issues addressed include use of multi-dimensional vs. single scalar approaches to measuring quality of life. The former seems preferable to the latter. This is illustrated by reference to examples from the national accounts systems approach, using objective data only, as proposed by Nestor Terleckyj, and the local use of questionnaires and interviews to deal with subjective feelings and reactions as reported in the citizen-type panel arrangements suggested by Norman Johnson and Edward Ward. Ways of allowing for trends and dynamic changes are examined and, inter alia, audits and other devices are suggested for detecting emerging needs for new roles and social-institutional arrangements. Areas that may lie beyond any such measurement and detection systems are also examined.

## 8. A Model to Study Revenue Sharing and Account for Regionalized Economic Activity and Social Goals
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- C. Colantoni
- W. W. Cooper
- K. O. Kortanek
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1973
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to provide a model to deal with multi-dimensional social goals on a regionalized (as well as national) basis and to relate these to each other in the context of a national economic system. Input-Output (Interindustry) Analysis is therefore regionalized and reformulated in a way that connects it to national economic policy variables in a Keynsian framework. Possible multiple objectives and controls are examined and their possible further developments are also sketched in a context of regionalized and social goals that differ from region to region and also from time to time. Various proposals for revenue sharing are exhibited and interpreted in the light of the possibilities this model admits. Special attention is given to the Nixon (President Nixon) and ACIR (Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations) plans in contrast to a multi-goal dynamic and adaptive control-incentive scheme with “saturating” indices of goal attainment. The latter, suggested at the end of this paper, is designed so that it can permit variation between regions while maintaining minimum levels of comparable attainment on goals that are common to more than one region.
