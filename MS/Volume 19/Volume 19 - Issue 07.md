## 1. Semi-Markov Decision Processes with Unbounded Rewards
### Author(s):
- Steven A. Lippman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
We consider a semi-Markov decision process with arbitrary action space; the state space is the nonnegative integers. As in queueing systems, we assume that {0, 1, 2, …, n + N} is the set of states accessible from state n in one transition, where N is finite and independent of n. The novel feature of this model is that the one-period reward is not required to be uniformly bounded; instead, we merely assume it to be bounded by a polynomial in n.

## 2. Joint Pricing and Inventory Decisions for Constant Priced Items
### Author(s):
- Howard Kunreuther
- Linus Schrage
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
This paper develops an algorithm for determining the pricing and ordering decisions for a firm that produces one product for which there is a deterministic demand curve that differs from period to period. It is assumed that the firm wants to maintain the same price for the product throughout the season. There is a fixed cost associated with each order placed (or alternatively, each batch produced) in addition to per unit ordering and storage costs for carrying inventory over time.

## 3. An Example of Loosely Coupled Stages in Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- D. J. White
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of determining which jobs, of a specified set, should be done in a given week, and whether or not nonnormal working time arrangements should be used. Such arrangements are more expensive in the sense that plant has to be kept going under undesirable conditions, but, on the other hand, delaying work until the next week will influence the mix of work in that week and hence the economics of operation in that week. There is an interaction between weekly work schedules, which is resolved by means of dynamic programming. The extent of coupling between weeks depends on the extent of overspill from one week to the next. The dynamic programming approach shows how the existence of a small level coupling may be used to reduce the computational load. In very loosely coupled systems the problem reduces to a simple two-stage problem. In uncoupled systems the problem reduces to a single-stage problem.

## 4. Stochastic Programs with Recourse: Random Recourse Costs Only
### Author(s):
- Stanley J. Garstka
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper we discuss the class of stochastic programs with recourse in which the only randomness present is in the recourse costs. Two economic interpretations are given. We present results which enable one to check if the convex deterministic equivalent program possesses all the “nice” properties of convex programs—feasibility, boundedness, solvability and dualizability. The simple recourse problem is then discussed. The specific form of the convex deterministic equivalent for the case of simple recourse is exhibited.

## 5. Linear Programming with Relative Bounded Variables
### Author(s):
- Claude Duguay
- Michael Todd
- Harvey M. Wagner
### Published:
- 24 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
Linear programming problems with simple upper and lower bounds on the variables have been well explored. Here we investigate the problems containing a system of relative lower bounds and/or relative upper bounds. We suggest computational procedures that exploit the special triangular structure of these constraints.

## 6. Minimax Policies for Selling a Nondivisible Asset
### Author(s):
- Vijay S. Bawa
### Published:
- 24 Nov 2015
### Abstract:
In this paper we have obtained a simple expression for the minimax regret policy for selling an asset. The policy is very simple to implement. As opposed to most optimal stopping rules, it does not involve any iterative computation of the stopping boundary. Also in using this result, only the maximum possible increase and decrease in prices in each period have to be known, as opposed to the entire distribution function of price changes in each period.

## 7. Optimal Use of Control Charts for Controlling Current Production
### Author(s):
- Shaul P. Ladany
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
A model is developed consisting of all the costs incurred when fraction-defective control charts are utilized to control current production: cost of sampling, cost of not detecting a change in the process, cost of false indication of change, and cost of re-adjusting detected changes. It is suggested that such control charts can be utilized in an optimal way, if those combinations of sample size, frequency of sampling and extent of control limits from process average will be used that provide the minimum total cost. It is further suggested that, by applying any specific cost data to this model, these optimal decision values can be easily evaluated by computer enumeration.

## 8. Bounds on the Wait in a GI/M/k Queue
### Author(s):
- Shelby L. Brumelle
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
The wait in a GI/M/k queue is bounded above (stochastically) by the wait in an associated GI/M/1 queue. The analysis of the single server queue is considerably easier than that of the k-server queue, and also the bounds developed for single server queues by J. F. C. Kingman and Kneale T. Marshall can be applied.

## 9. The Joint Stationary Multivariate Queue Length Distribution in a Single Server Queueing System with N Queues, Arbitrary Priorities, and a General Probabilistic Inter-Queue Transition Matrix
### Author(s):
- T. K. Wignall
- E. G. Enns
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
In modern telephone systems utilizing computers, the realization of a single server feedback queueing system often arises. In this paper, it is assumed that an originating or transferred call to such a system requires a number of different services before leaving the system as a completed or rejected call. A customer may also repeat a portion of his services, omit some services, or leave the system after any service with some assigned probabilities. In this paper, we present a theorem on the joint multi-variate queue length distribution, in a system with N services or queues, arbitrary priorities, and a general probabilistic transition matrix inter-connecting the various queues.

## 10. Duality Theory for Infinite Horizon Convex Models
### Author(s):
- Martin L. Weitzman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
Often it is desirable to formulate certain decision problems without specifying a cut-off date and terminal conditions (which are sometimes felt to be arbitrary). This paper examines the duality theory that goes along with the kind of open-ended convex programming models frequently encountered in mathematical economics and operations research. Under a set of general axioms, duality conditions necessary and sufficient for infinite horizon optimality are derived. The proof emphasizes the close connection between duality theory for infinite horizon convex models and dynamic programming. Dual prices with the required properties are inductively constructed in each period as supports to the state evaluation function.

## 11. Computational Experience with an M-Salesman Traveling Salesman Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Joseph A. Svestka
- Vaughn E. Huckfeldt
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
A formulation of the traveling salesman problem with more than one salesman is offered. The particular formulation has computational advantages over other formulations. Experience is obtained with an exact branch and bound algorithm employing both upper and lower bounds (mean run time for 55 city problems is one minute). Due to the special formulation, certain subtours may satisfy the constraints, thus reducing the search. A very good initial tour and upper bound are employed. The determination of these as well as the pathology of the formulation and the algorithm are discussed. No increase in computation time over the one-salesman case is experienced.

## 12. An Analysis of a Multi-Line Re-Order System Using a Can-Order Policy
### Author(s):
- Michael J. Maher
- John C. Gittins
- Roger W. Morgan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
This paper analyses an inventory system which employs a “can-order” policy. Under such a policy lines of stock are re-ordered when they run out, and at these times lines which have not run out are also re-ordered if the stock levels in particular lines are below the “can-order level.” The well-known policies of independent and of joint re-orders are extreme cases of a can-order policy. Optimal values of the initial stock level and the can-order level are found, and are given in graphical form for the cases of 2 and 3 identical lines. An approximate method is described which finds these values for higher numbers of lines, and the method is shown to be a significant improvement on the two basic policies. Finally, the extension of the model to the general case, in which each line may have a separate unit holding cost and a separate sales rate, is discussed and some proposals made for optimisation.

## 13. The Equivalence of Integer Programs to Constrained Recursive Systems
### Author(s):
- Patanjali S. Nanda
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
It has been established that integer programs with integral, recursive constraint matrices have integral extreme points for integral, nonnegative requirement vectors. In this paper, it is first shown that the assignment problem can be transformed to such a program, but with upper bounds on some variables. This equivalent program leads to additional results for solving the assignment problem. Algorithms are then delineated to transform matching, covering and travelling salesman problems to equivalent recursive programs of the aforementioned type, but with bounds on some variables. These results are extended to programs with special structure in their constraint matrices.

## 14. The Use of Distribution Functions to Represent Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Marvin H. Berhold
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1973
### Abstract:
This paper considers the decision maker whose evaluation and consequent choice of actions is accomplished through the use of the expected utility hypothesis. In cases where the utility function is increasing with upper and lower bounds then the utility function can be characterized by a distribution function, and we can take advantage of the various properties of such functions as well as existing results with respect to such functions. Using these properties and results we can determine the certainty equivalents as a function of the parameters of the distribution function (utility function) and the parameters of the probability distribution on the uncertain payoff. The following cases are considered: (1) Gaussian distribution function and Gaussian probability distribution, (2) Exponential distribution function and exponential distribution and (3) Exponential distribution function and Gaussian probability distribution.
