## 1. Management Sciences in an Underdeveloped Country: The Case of Operations Research in Peru
### Author(s):
- Francisco R. Sagasti
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
This paper examines the development of management sciences in Peru, with particular reference to the introduction and diffusion of operations research in the 1960's. The reactions of government officials and executives in private industry to management science are analyzed. The educational and institutional aspects of the future of OR are also examined. The paper ends with a discussion of the methodological aspects of operations research work in underdeveloped countries.

## 2. A Hospital Admission System Based on Nursing Work Load
### Author(s):
- Fred L. Offensend
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
A model is presented to compare hospital admission systems based on (i) patient census and (ii) nursing work load. It is shown that nursing costs are lower under the work load-based system than under the patient-based one. Sensitivity studies show that the difference between the two systems is due to the fact that the work load-based policy takes into account patient differences.

## 3. A Dynamic Model for Bond Portfolio Management
### Author(s):
- Stephen P. Bradley
- Dwight B. Crane
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
The bond portfolio problem is viewed as a multistage decision problem in which buy, sell, and hold decisions are made at successive (discrete) points in time. Normative models of this decision problem tend to become very large, particularly when its dynamic structure and the uncertainty of future interest rates and cash flows are incorporated in the model. In this paper we present a multiple period bond portfolio model and suggest a new approach for efficiently solving problems which are large enough to make use of as much information as portfolio managers can reasonably provide. The procedure utilizes the decomposition algorithm of mathematical programming and an efficient technique developed for solving subproblems of the overall portfolio model. The key to the procedure is the definition of subproblems which are easily solved via a simple recursive relationship.

## 4. A System of Promotional Models
### Author(s):
- Ambar G. Rao
- Gary Lilien
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
A system of promotional-effect models developed from certain behavioral assumptions about consumer buying habits is described. The same basic model structure is shown to be applicable to several types of gasoline marketing promotions and to various nongasoline promotions as well. Parameter estimation procedures and methods for calculating the effect of simultaneous promotions are discussed. The models were developed to be used with a computerized MIS for market planning and sales forecasting and are validated using actual sales data. Included are insights into the customer buying process that were revealed during the parameter estimation and updating procedures.

## 5. A Simultaneous Decision Model for Production, Marketing and Finance
### Author(s):
- William W. Damon
- Richard Schramm
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
The Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon production scheduling model is extended to incorporate variables reflecting marketing and working capital management in a cash flow formulation. A constrained nonlinear program is dervied for which a local optimal solution is discovered employing the SUMT program. Reasonable values are are assigned to the parameters and the relative profitability of such a simultaneous formulation, compared to a sequential model, is tested. Initial results demonstrate an improvement of 25% by solving for the optimal values of the functional decision variables simultaneously.

## 6. On Normal Approximations of the Frequency Functions of Standard Forms Where the Main Variables are Normally Distributed
### Author(s):
- Jack C. Hayya
- William L. Ferrara
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
Risk analysts frequently encounter functional relationships concerning costs and revenue which can be expressed as standard algebraic forms. The forms are quadratic, product, or mixed functions of variables which are normally distributed and not necessarily statistically independent. (The ratio functions will hopefully be the subject of a paper that follows this.) Generally, interest focuses on the construction of 2σ or 3σ probability intervals for each form. Since probability distributions of these forms, as far as the risk analyst is concerned, are neither tabled nor easily derived, the desired probability intervals are not easily constructed.

## 7. Some Problems in using Diffusion Models for New Products
### Author(s):
- Irwin Bernhardt
- Kenneth D. Mackenzie
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes some of the problems involved in using diffusion models to formulate marketing strategies for introducing new products. Though future work in this area appears justified, there are many unresolved problems which limit application. First, there is no theory for adoption and diffusion processes. Such a theory is outlined in this paper. Secondly, the present models are too restrictive and do not include the variables that a marketing manager has at his disposal. Six models which remove some of the theoretical and methodological restrictions are therefore presented. The marketing implications of the assumptions in the models are discussed.

## 8. Summary of a Simple Model of Mode Choice
### Author(s):
- Billy J. Eatherly
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
This note summarizes a simple model of mode choice which considers such choice as depending only upon time and money costs of travel. Distance boundaries for modes and expressions for the proportion of trips by abstract modes are presented and discussed briefly. The effects of variation in time value are briefly discussed in the context of the model.

## 9. A Note on the Use of Nonparametric Statistics in Stochastic Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Gerhard Tintner
- M. V. Rama Sastry
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
An ordinary linear programming problem is formulated as
under the constraints
where A is a matrix with m rows and n columns, x and c are column vectors with n elements, and b is a column vector with n elements. The theory of stochastic linear programming first suggested by Tintner [Tintner, G. 1955. Stochastic linear programming with applications to agricultural economics. Sympos. Linear Programming, Vol. 1. National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C., 197 ff.] uses the following approach. The elements of b, c and the matrix A are assumed to be random variables with a known probability distribution. Two possible ways of deriving the distribution of z are known as direct and indirect methods.

## 11. A Note on Sharpe's Algorithm for Minimizing the Sum of Absolute Deviations in a Simple Regression Problem
### Author(s):
- M. R. Rao
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
A recent article in this Journal provides an efficient computational scheme for obtaining a regression line that minimizes the sum of absolute deviations of a set of two-dimensional points. The present note interprets that procedure as the solution of the parametric dual to the linear programming formulation of the problem. An alternate and about equally efficient procedure for solving the same problem is also provided.

## 13. Précis—A Brief Note on the Dimensionality of the Supervisory Inventory on Human Relations
### Author(s):
- S. B. Khan
- George Morgan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1972
### Abstract:
The Supervisory Inventory on Human Relations (SIHR) was developed by Kirkpatrick and Planty [Kirkpatrick, D. L., E. Planty. 1965. Supervisory Inventory on Human Relations. Dr. D. L. Kirkpatrick, Brookfield, Wisconsin.] for use in the evaluation of supervisory performance, diagnosis, on-the-job coaching, and as a device for conference discussions during training and selection of supervisors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if items can be meaningfully grouped on an empirical basis as a first step toward the use of subscales and profiles.
