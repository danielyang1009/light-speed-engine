## 1. Parameters of Discrete Time Models of Detection of Change
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
A discrete time detection of change (DC) process is characterized by a state S0 that at some stage t turns into state S1. Either of two decisions is made at each stage τ: W—take another observation, or D—S1 is the true state. In the former case, the result of each observation is a random variable x, which has a probability density function fo(x) if t > τ or f1(x) if t ≦ τ. In the latter case, if t > τ, an error loss is incurred, the knowledge that t > τ is gained, and the process continues, whereas if t ≦ τ the process terminates with a delay loss proportional to τ − t. In the modified detection of change (MDC) process D is a terminal decision.

## 2. Queuing Processes at Competing Service Facilities
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
The queuing models constructed here have the feature that a service facility tends to lose its customers if they often encounter lengthy delays. Structurally, the arrival processes are assumed to depend on past waiting times, hence on past arrival and service processes. The cases investigated include a service facility with several competitors and a facility with very many competitors; these correspond roughly to oligopoly and to perfect competition in micro-economics. For the duopoly case, approximate analytical solutions are presented along with graphs for numerical solutions. A data sample is given that is moderately consistent with the duopoly model.

## 3. Operating Policies in Multiechelon Dual-Constraint Job Shops
### Author(s):
- John S. Fryer
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper a simulation study to examine the effects of operating policies on the performance of a multiechelon dual-constraint job shop is described. A hypothetical shop in which machines and workers are constraining resources is the setting of the study. The shop consists of divisions comprised of work centers which, in turn, contain machines to which workers are assigned. There are fewer workers than machines. Operating policies consist of rules for dispatching and labor control. There are two levels of labor control—decision rules are used for allocating workers to divisions and then to work centers within divisions. The measures of shop performance are mean flow-time, flow-time variance, and worker transfers between divisions and work centers.

## 4. Control Policies for a Single Server System
### Author(s):
- K. R. Balachandran
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
The paper deals with two parametric control policies for a single service facility when the arrivals are distributed as Poisson and the service durations have a general distribution. The N-policy is to turn on the server (i. e., open the service channel for service) when the queue size reaches the number N and turn him off when the system is empty. The D-policy is to turn on the server when the total work to be done reaches the value D instead. The optimum policies are compared for both the policies when the costs assumed are linear. It is shown that for constant service the optimal policies are equivalent and for exponential service the D-policy is not superior to the N-policy.

## 6. Investment in Series and Parallel Systems to Maximize Expected Life
### Author(s):
- S. E. Jacobsen
- S. Arunkumar
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
A series (parallel) system consisting of n stochastically independent components is considered. The system works if, and only it, each component (at least one component) works. The failure time distribution of each component can be influenced by investment in that component. The optimization problem is to choose an investment allocation which maximizes expected system life. It is demonstrated that this nonseparable problem can be solved, in some cases, by solving a sequence of related separable problems. It is also shown that, under rather general conditions, a solution associated with the sequence of separable problems is a local maximum.

## 7. Majority Rule Under Transitivity Constraints
### Author(s):
- V. J. Bowman
- C. S. Colantoni
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper we are concerned with imposing constraints directly on the admissible majority decisions so as to insure transitivity without restricting individual preference orderings. We demonstrate that this corresponds to requiring that majority decisions be confined to the extreme points of a convex polyhedron. Thus, transitive majority decisions can be characterized as basic solutions of a set of linear inequalities. Through the use of a majority decision function (which is not restricted to be linear) it is shown that constrained majority rule is equivalent to an integer programming problem. Some special forms of majority decision functions are studied including the generalized lp norm and an indicator function. Implications of an integer programming solution, including alternate optima and post optimality analysis, are also discussed.

## 8. An Efficient Minimal Cost Flow Algorithm
### Author(s):
- G. E. Bennington
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
One of the methods of solving the minimal cost flow problem is to find cycles of negative length in a marginal cost network. These negative cycles indicate a change in the flows around the cycle, which will result in a reduction in the total cost. The proposed method finds negative cycles by attempting to find the shortest chains from a fixed node to all other nodes. Results of computational experiments comparing this algorithm with the out-of-kilter algorithm are presented. These results indicate that the proposed method of repetitively detecting negative cycles yields an efficient minimal cost flow algorithm.

## 9. Simplification Activities in a Network Scheduling Context
### Author(s):
- William J. Abernathy
- Joel S. Demski
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
Network scheduling activities are usually addressed in a two-stage process of static schedule determination and subsequent control monitoring. A more complete view combines these two subsets of decisions with information acquisition decisions into a dynamic optimization framework. Such a framework is developed and the familiar static schedule-control process is then interpreted as a cost-effective simplification of the more complete dynamic formulation. This provides a framework for highlighting the numerous choices made in specifying the typical two-stage process and for evaluating the various choice alternatives. A simulation example illustrates the simplification and its evaluation with the more complete framework.

## 10. Job Shop Sequencing Problem on Two Machines with Time Lag Constraints
### Author(s):
- S. S. Panwalkar
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
The problem studied is that of two-machine job shop sequencing where some jobs are processed first on machine 1 and then on machine 2, while the remaining jobs are processed in the reverse order. The objective is to determine an ordered sequence which minimizes the total processing time, subject to some specified lag time constraints. A rule is given for determining two different sequences for the two machines which represent an optimal solution.

## 12. State Substitution and the Estimation of Transition Probabilities
### Author(s):
- Warren T. Dent
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
Variants of Markovian decision models are many. Of those concerned with the estimation of transition probabilities, few deal with the case of limited information in which only data on market shares are available. Where such investigations have been undertaken, the assumption of constant transition probabilities has been insurmountable. This paper offers a simple heuristic technique to estimate nonstationary transition probabilities, especially in the case where fluctuations in market shares are felt to reflect the effects of secondary considerations external to the transition probabilities as well as effects of the probabilities themselves. Dynamic and quadratic programming are the suggested tools of analysis.

## 13. Minimal Cost Cut Equivalent Networks
### Author(s):
- Jean-Claude Picard
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the following problem in network synthesis. Suppose that we are given a network with real-valued capacities on each arc. There is a cost associated with each arc which is proportional to the magnitude of the arc capacity. We wish to determine new arc capacities such that the capacity of each cut in the new network differs from the capacity of the corresponding cut in the original network by a specified constant and such that the total cost is minimized. This problem is shown to be equivalent to solving a minimum cost flow problem on a related network.

## 14. Note—Economic Ordering Frequency for Several Items Jointly Replenished
### Author(s):
- Dominique J. Nocturne
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
We consider a problem typical of the batch processing industry. This problem arises when a product is packaged simultaneously into more than one type container after its manufacture, and when set-up costs are associated with the making of the product as well as the packaging of the various items. We formulate the production inventory problem so as to minimize the total holding and set-up costs and give a graphical solution for the two-item case.

## 15. Note—A Note on the Deterministic Capacity Problem
### Author(s):
- Richard J. Giglio
### Published:
- 1 May 1973
### Abstract:
This note extends some work by Manne [Manne, A. S. 1961. Capacity expansion and probabilistic growth. Econometrica29 (4, October).], which dealt with the case where demand was growing linearly, and also some work by Srinivasan [Srinivasan, T. N. Geometric rate of growth of demand. Investments for Capacity Expansion 150–156.] who assumed demand was growing geometrically. The difference lies in the form of the demand which here is assumed to be growing at a decreasing rate.
