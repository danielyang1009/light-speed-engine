## 2. Municipal Bond Coupon Schedules with Limitations on the Number of Coupons
### Author(s):
- H. Martin Weingartner
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The optimum coupon schedule for serial bonds issued by municipalities has been solved as a knapsack problem, and is widely implemented in bank and nonbank underwriting firms. A large subset of issues carries the additional requirement that limits the number of distinct coupons which the underwriters may assign to the issue. The paper formulates this problem as a dynamic programming model and discusses the computational aspects relating to this formulation by comparing it with a direct 0/1 integer programming model. Some computational experience is also provided.

## 3. Notes—Note on “Municipal Bond Coupon Schedules with Limitations on the Number of Coupons”
### Author(s):
- Marshall Freimer
- Mendu R. Rao
- H. Martin Weingartner
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The optimal coupon schedule for municipal bonds with limits on the number of distinct coupons is formulated in terms of two different dynamic programming models which, in contrast to the companion paper, do guarantee an optimal solution, although at the cost of additional computational difficulty.

## 4. The Use of the Delphi Procedures in Manpower Forecasting
### Author(s):
- George T. Milkovich
- Anthony J. Annoni
- Thomas A. Mahoney
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper is a case study in the development, implementation and evaluation of the delphi technique, which systematically makes use of expert judgment in generating manpower forecasts. The study was conducted in a large national retail organization on professional manpower. The results of the delphi technique are compared with results generated by conventional regression based models and the actual experience of the organization, which serves as the criterion. The study also analyzes the Informational elements used by experts during the delphi procedures and develops a model based on these elements. The usefulness of the delphi in generating manpower forecasting models is also discussed.

## 5. Constrained Markov Decision Chains
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
We consider finite state and action discrete time parameter Markov decision chains. The objective is to provide an algorithm for finding a policy that minimizes the long-run expected average cost when there are linear side conditions on the limit points of the expected state-action frequencies. This problem has been solved previously only for the case where every deterministic stationary policy has at most one ergodic class. This note removes that restriction by applying the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle.

## 6. An Analytical Model of a Two-Product, One-Machine, Production-Inventory System
### Author(s):
- Thom J. Hodgson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the modeling and analysis of a one-machine two-product, integrated production-inventory system. A semi-Markovian model is developed which incorporates a state dependent control system heretofore not used in integrated production-inventory models. Control optimization is achieved through the use of Markov-renewal programming. The model is exercised over a range of parameters in order to determine the characteristics of the system. An analysis of the experimental results leads to the following conjectures about the production-inventory system:

## 7. Some Empirical Tests of the Criss-Cross Method
### Author(s):
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
Randomly-generated linear programming problems of three different types and five different sizes were solved by the criss-cross method and by the simplex method. One hundred problems of each type and size were solved, and the results are overwhelmingly favorable to the criss-cross method. An improvement to the criss-cross method used in these tests is given, and the extension of the results of the paper to variations of the criss-cross and simplex methods is discussed.

## 8. A Mathematical Programming Model for Scheduling Nursing Personnel in a Hospital
### Author(s):
- D. Michael Warner
- Juan Prawda
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The Nursing Personnel Scheduling Problem is defined as the identification of that staffing pattern which (1) specifies the number of nursing personnel of each skill class to be scheduled among the wards and nursing shifts of a scheduling period, (2) satisfies total nursing personnel capacity, integral assignment, and other relevant constraints, and (3) minimizes a “shortage cost” of nursing care services provided for the scheduling period. The problem is posed as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem, which is decomposed by a primal resource-directive approach into a multiple-choice programming master problem, with quadratic programming sub-problems. Initial results suggest that a linear programming formulation, with a post-optimal feasibility search scheme, may be substituted for the multiple-choice master problem. The model is tested on six wards of a 600-bed general hospital, and results are presented.

## 9. Production-Line Balances for Mixed-Model Lines
### Author(s):
- J. L. C. Macaskill
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of mixed-model assembly-line balancing. First, the balance problem is formulated, and some of the difficulties of achieving effective balances in practice are noted. Next, balance procedures designed to obtain expeditious computer solutions of large-scale mixed-model balances are presented, and results obtained for a small-scale balance by a program incorporating these procedures are discussed. Effect on line performance is considered, and an estimate is made of the computer effort required to achieve a balance for a large-scale assembly operation. Finally some general conclusions are presented.

## 10. Environmental Structure and Programmed Decision Effectiveness
### Author(s):
- Ronald J. Ebert
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
In this study, intuitive aggregate production scheduling performance under various environmental conditions is related to Bowman’s theory of managerial coefficients. Controlled decision environments were established in four hypothetical companies to isolate the effects of differences in information relevance and planning activities. Results illustrate the effects of environmental differences on the formation of intuitive scheduling rules.

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for determining the minimum cost schedule of tasks in a critical path network in which task cost-time curves may be concave. A computer program for the case of cost-time curves that are piecewise linear in two segments is described, and a numerical example is presented.

## 12. Chromatic Scheduling and the Chromatic Number Problem
### Author(s):
- J. Randall Brown
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The chromatic scheduling problem may be defined as any problem in which the solution is a partition of a set of objects. Since the partitions may not be distinct, redundant solutions can be generated when partial enumeration techniques are applied to chromatic scheduling problems. The necessary theory is developed to prevent redundant solutions in the application of partial enumeration techniques to chromatic scheduling problems with indistinguishable partitions and distinct objects. The chromatic number problem, which is the problem of finding the chromatic number of any graph, is a particular case of the chromatic scheduling problem. Two algorithms, basic and look-ahead, are developed for the chromatic number problem. Computational experience is given for each algorithm.
