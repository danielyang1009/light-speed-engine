## 1. Evaluating Market Segmentation Studies: The Properties of R2
### Author(s):
- Donald G. Morrison
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
Virtually all of the empirical studies on market segmentation can be characterized as unsuccessful in terms of R2. That is, the set of independent variables used have not explained much of the variance in purchasing behavior. R2's of 0.01 and 0,02 are not uncommon. In this article we show that R2 is an inappropriate statistic to use in evaluating most of these studies. We show that good models with good sets of variables can yield low (and even zero!) R2's. In this context “good” variables are ones that explain the average purchasing behavior of a family. The previous studies on market segmentation should be re-evaluated in light of the results presented here.

## 2. A Characterization of M/G/1 Queues with Renewal Departure Processes
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Disney

- Paulo Renato De Morais
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
Burke [Burke, P. J. 1956. The output of a queueing system. Oper. Res.4 699–704.] showed that the departure process from an M/M/1 queue with infinite capacity was in fact a Poisson process. Using methods from semi-Markov process theory, this paper extends this result by determining that the departure process from an M/G/1 queue is a renewal process if and only if the queue is in steady state and one of the following four conditions holds: (1) the queue is the null queue—the service times are all 0; (2) the queue has capacity (excluding the server) 0; (3) the queue has capacity 1 and the service times are constant (deterministic); or (4) the queue has infinite capacity and the service times are negatively exponentially distributed (M/M/1/∞ queue).

## 3. Quadratic Inventory Cost Approximations and the Aggregation of Individual Products
### Author(s):
- L. J. Krajewski
- V. A. Mabert
- H. E. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to place into focus a whole class of problems that have not yet received the attention they deserve. The problem studied, although seemingly narrow in scope, reflects a much broader class of problems relating aggregate and disaggregate cost functions. It raises questions relating to the efficacy of constructing aggregate cost functions that adequately represent the “true” costs and, at the same time, are easy to manipulate in decision models. It also questions whether seemingly optimal aggregate decisions will lead to serious suboptimalities when they are broken down to the level of disaggregation necessary for implementation. The questions are raised in the context of the aggregate inventory cost function of HMMS as well as their suggested procedure for using disaggregate data to estimate the parameters of the aggregate cost function. It is found that, under conditions of varying demand, the parameters of the aggregate cost function ordinarily thought to be independent of demand are in fact highly related to demand. Approximate cost functions designed to hold in certain ranges of the decision variables may fit poorly in other ranges and may therefore be unreasonable for developing decision rules for respond-to rather wide variations in demand.

## 4. Dynamic Facility Location
### Author(s):
- George O. Wesolowsky
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
This paper extends the static single facility location problem to a model that permits location changes within a planning horizon of r periods. An algorithm is developed to optimize the sequence of locations in order to meet changes in costs, volumes and locations of destinations.

## 5. Optimal Control of Time-Varying Queuing Systems
### Author(s):
- F. T. Man
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
The optimal control of a single-stage multi-server time-varying queuing system is considered. A mathematical model and an index of performance for the queuing system are formulated, and the optimal arrival rate of the input process to the service mechanism is then determined. Some of the physical implications of the optimal control policy relative to the dynamic overload control system presently adopted in the toll telephone network are discussed.

## 6. Necessary Conditions for Optimality for Paths Lying on a Corner
### Author(s):
- Jason L. Speyer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
A class of optimization problems is investigated in which some of the functions, continuous in all their arguments, have continuous right- and left-hand derivatives but are not equal at a point called the corner. For this nonclassical problem, a set of first order necessary conditions for stationarity is determined for an optimal path which may have arcs lying on a corner for a nonzero length of time. Enough conditions are provided to construct an extremal path. This, in part, is achieved by noting that the corner defines a manifold in which the derivatives of all the functions are uniquely defined. Three examples, two of which represent possible aggregate production and employment planning models, illustrate the theory.

## 7. Economically Optimum Design of Cusum Charts
### Author(s):
- Amrit L. Goel
- S. M. Wu
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
We present a procedure for the economic design of Cusum charts to control the mean of a process with a normally distributed quality characteristic. A model is derived which gives the long-ran average cost as a function of both the design parameters of the chart and the cost and risk factors associated with the process. The “pattern-search” technique is employed to determine the optimum values of the sample size, the sampling interval and the decision limit. The cost surfaces are investigated, numerically, to study the effects of changes in the design parameters and in some of the cost and risk factors.

## 8. Scheduling to Minimize the Number of Late Jobs When Set-Up and Processing Times are Uncertain
### Author(s):
- Stephen J. Balut
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
The n job, one-machine scheduling problem is considered where set-up and processing times are random and the objective is to minimize the number of late jobs. In the deterministic case, Moore's algorithm is known to produce an optimal schedule. A chance-constrained formulation of the nondeterministic problem is derived in which a job is processed if the probability that it will be completed prior to its due date is greater than a specified level. A deterministic equivalent problem is achieved to which application of a modification of Moore's algorithm is proven to produce an optimal schedule.

## 9. An Optimal Stopping Problem of a Growing Inventory
### Author(s):
- Eithan Hochman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of explaining the behavior of a producer entering the period with growing inventory, while the current price and a stochastic distribution of prices for the following period are given. The conceptual framework is one of searching for an optimal stopping rule for this problem. It is shown that the optimal policy consists of finding a unique cutoff price function, which is non-increasing with respect to the age of the stock.

## 10. Optimal Issuing Policies
### Author(s):
- Mark Brown
- Sheldon M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
Consider a stockpile consisting of n items where the ith item has a rating ri, i = 1, …, n. An item with rating r, if kept in stockpile until time t and then released to the field, will have a field life of rd(t). Thus it is assumed that for any t, the field life for issuance at time t is proportional to the time 0 field life.

## 11. A Class of Deterministic Production Planning Problems
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
- M. R. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
A deterministic production planning problem with limited backlogging, inventory and production capacity constraints is considered. The model also includes a certain type of production cost function which is neither convex nor concave. A characterization of the extreme points is provided and an algorithm is suggested for the problem with equal production capacities. It is also shown how initial inventory can easily be incorporated into the model.

## 14. Lot Size Scheduling on a Single Machine for Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- S. K. Goyal
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for computing the lot size to be produced each time each product is scheduled for production when all products are produced on a single machine. The method also computes the distribution of lot size for each product. The demand for each product is a stochastic variable with known distribution, distributed independently for nonoverlapping time periods and identically for equal time periods.

## 15. On Chance Constrained Programming Problems with Joint Constraints
### Author(s):
- Vijay S. Bawa
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1973
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider chance constrained programming problems with joint constraints shown in the literature to be equivalent deterministic nonlinear programming problems. Since most existing computational methods for solution require that the constraints of the equivalent deterministic problem be concave, we obtain a simple condition for which the concavity assumption holds when the right-hand side coefficients are independent random variables. We show that it holds for most probability distributions of practical importance. For the case where the random vector has a multivariate normal distribution, nonexistence of any efficient numerical methods for evaluating multivariate normal integrals necessitates the use of lower bound approximations. We propose an approximation for the case of positively correlated normal random variables.
