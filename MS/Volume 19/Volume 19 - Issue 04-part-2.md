## 1. Introduction to Urban Issues II
### Author(s):
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This is the sequel to Urban Issues I, the special issue which was edited by this Department and published in Management Science, Vol. 16, No. 12 (August 1970). Like its predecessor the present collection has been pointed toward delineating new possibilities for management science approaches to urban problems. Also like its predecessor, the present compilation is drawn from a variety of sources which include papers presented at scientific-professional society meetings, papers selected from the normal flow of mss. into this department and papers obtained by special invitation.

## 2. Information Requirements for Urban Systems: A View into the Possible Future?
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- G. Kozmetsky
- T. Ruefli
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The successful management of urban systems is becoming increasingly a matter of successful information about the urban area and its environment. Using information as a basis for developing a structure for, and outlining the flows in, an urban area, this paper develops a dual hierarchy of information requirements and management activities. Each level of the hierarchy is discussed in terms of the emergent problems and requirements that are likely to confront management scientists and urban administrators in the future. As the information requirements of urban areas become more complex and as the components of the urban system become more highly interrelated, developments in information technology can be expected to have a direct impact on the activities of urban area administrators. This development is illustrated here through the presentation of a selected number of possible impacts of information technology developments upon the information and management hierarchies of urban systems.

## 3. Citizen Information Systems: Using Technology to Extend the Dialogue between Citizens and Their Government
### Author(s):
- Norman Johnson
- Edward Ward
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This article describes a citizen information system. Such a system (panel in type, neighborhood in orientation, public in character) is an important link in extending the notion of citizen participation in both policy and programs in a rapidly changing society. This extension is essential, since over time citizen participation schemes have tended to move in a way limiting the number of citizens involved. This limiting aspect is anachronistic in a democratic society, but, more importantly, turbulence or irrelevance may be expected unless the pendulum is moving to become more inclusive in an ongoing way (rather than exclusive). In addition to the information structure a second part of the participation strategy proposes considerations and trade-off possibilities for citizen use. An Urban-University Service Center (in analogy to the Agricultural Extension Service) is suggested as one vehicle for actualizing the use model of the participation strategy. The need for citizen advocates as a part of a use strategy is suggested in an intelligently formulated adversary process based on continued gathering and exploitation of suitably arranged information systems.

## 4. Discussion
### Author(s):
- David B. Hertz
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
Information technology, as emphasized by Charnes, Kozmetsky and Ruefli, will undoubtedly influence the formulation of urban goals significantly. The more that is known and disseminated about the condition of man, his hopes, aspirations and fears in an increasingly urban world, the more broadly based will be the goals he sets for himself. And yet, will this “explosion” of information technology lead to more effective choices of end objectives? One can only hope so, but the Charnes, Kozmetsky and Ruefli paper does not provide any clear evidence that this will be the case.

## 5. Discussion
### Author(s):
- Michael J. Flax
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
I want to begin by stating that I am doing research at one of the institutions that was formed in an attempt to cope with the a rapid changes occurring in information technology about which Dean Kozmetsky was talking in the paper he wrote with Professors Charnes and Ruefli. The Urban Institute is a problem oriented, multi-disciplinary research organization investigating urban problems. Many of the staff, including myself, have had experience in the “systems approach” which was used so extensively by defense research agencies.

## 6. A Simulation of Municipal Zoning Decisions
### Author(s):
- Otto A. Davis
- Frederick H. Rueter
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper reports a study which developed and empirically tested a simulation model of the process by which zoning ordinances are altered to adapt to the changing needs and conditions of a city. The perceived decision rules of the participants are reported in the form of flow charts which utilize language similar to that used by the participants. The body of the paper indicates methods which were used to translate these judgmental rules into a form suitable for a computer. The model was tested by allowing the computer to decide the one hundred twenty-five proposed changes in the zoning map of the City of Pittsburgh during the period 1963 to 1965 inclusive. The results were good in the sense that the computer model decided most of the cases in the same way as did the human participants. Additional tests and managerial implications are also discussed.

## 7. The Delivery of Ambulatory Care to the Poor: A Literature Review
### Author(s):
- Judith R. Lave
- Samuel Leinhardt
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
The authors review the literature on the delivery of ambulatory care to the urban poor by isolating the crucial variables affecting the supply and demand for such services and organizing the literature around these concepts. The state of health of the poor, perception of health, and cost of care are examined as factors influencing demand. Then the consequences of various policies designed to intervene in the market are considered. Since little systematic date have been collected on the costs and benefits of these programs, the authors conclude by discussing an alternative to the current system of delivering ambulatory care to the poor and raise several issues for future research.

## 8. An Application of Operations Research to School Desegregation
### Author(s):
- R. P. Lutz

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
This paper describes an operations research approach taken to implement a desegregation plan for the Oklahoma City Public Schools. While the main objective of the plan was desegregation, it also provides for an equal educational opportunity for all students and more efficient utilization of facilities. The essential element of the plan is that students attend their same home schools, but each school is responsible for a certain specialty area, such as science, mathematics, or foreign language. Students taking specialty courses travel to those schools. Thus, inherent in the plan is the technically complex problem of scheduling students among several schools in varying time patterns to minimize total weekly student travel time.

## 9. Methods for Allocating Urban Emergency Units: A Survey
### Author(s):
- Jan M. Chaiken
- Richard C. Larson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1972
### Abstract:
An urban emergency service system provides mobile units (vehicles) to respond to requests for service which can occur at any time and any place throughout a city. This paper describes the common characteristics and operational problems of these systems and surveys the various methods, both traditional and recently developed, which may be used for allocating their units. Aspects of allocation policy discussed include (1) determining the number of units to have on duty, (2) locating the units, (3) designing their response areas or patrol areas, (4) relocating units, and (5) planning preventive-patrol patterns for police cars.
