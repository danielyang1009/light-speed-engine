## 2. Linear Programming and Financial Analysis of the New Community Development Process
### Author(s):
- Richard L. Heroux
- William A. Wallace
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
The land development process with its concomitant financial analysis is described for new communities. A multi-period linear programming model was constructed permitting the determination of (1) maximum revenues, (2) the optimal development schedule, (3) the optimal parcelization schedule, and (4) the optimal land allocations for the proposed new community. The model's role as an aid to the developer is described, and a procedure proposed, based upon the dual variables, that links the financial analysis to the plan for development. The applicability of the model is illustrated via a case study of a proposed large-scale development.

## 3. From Statistical Decision Theory to Practice: Some Problems with the Transition
### Author(s):
- David W. Conrath
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
While considerable progress has been made in the development of sophisticated statistical decision models, little attention has been paid to the problem of applying them in the “real world.” This paper approaches one aspect of the necessary conversion process, namely the conceptualization and use of probabilistic data for decision making. Three points are demonstrated on the basis of clinical experimental evidence: (1) decision makers have difficulty conceiving of probability distributions, rather they are more comfortable with point estimates; (2) the concept of “risk of failure,” the probability of failing to meet a perceived target, plays a major role in choice; and (3) the format in which probabilistic data are presented can affect choice behavior. A simple descriptive decision model is then developed, based on both the clinical evidence and two years of observation of a committee empowered to invest in new product development and product expansion activities.

## 4. Cognitive Style and the Acceptance of Management Science Recommendations
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Doktor
- William F. Hamilton
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
The effective implementation of management science results depends upon a wide variety of technical and organizational factors. This paper examines the effects of cognitive style in the implementation process. Previous research in cognitive theory and implementation indicates that the nature of the researcher-manager interface may be related to measurable cognitive factors. An experimental study was conducted to investigate the influence of cognitive style and the style of written reports on the acceptance of management science recommendations. Graduate students and practicing managers participated in separate but identical experimental trials. The findings indicate that differences in acceptance rates are due not only to differences in cognitive style, but also to differences in the subject populations.

## 5. A Survey of Management Science in University Operations
### Author(s):
- Roger G. Schroeder
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
This survey discusses applications and research of the Management Sciences in institutions of higher education. It includes four specific areas: (1) Planning, Programming and Budgeting Systems, (2) Management Information Systems, (3) Resource Allocation Models, and (4) Mathematical Models. In each of these areas, the major trends and literature are discussed along with numerous references. The survey also provides an integration and synthesis of the recent work from both published and unpublished reports. We conclude with four specific problem areas which are evidently in need of further attention. These areas are (1) stability and suitability of various student flow projections, (2) investigation of decision making processes and the information which should be used, (3) measurement of outputs, and (4) alternative approaches to improve planning methodology.

## 6. Analytical Effectiveness of Mathematical Models for R&D Project Selection
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
Four mathematical programming models for R&D project selection and funding are developed, based on similar models and results in the literature. Project selection and funding decision planning data for thirty actual R&D projects are collected and the models are used with these data to ascertain which of the available projects to select and how much to spend on them. The portfolios prescribed by each model are compared with a prorata benchmark allocation, an ex post optimum allocation based on the success/fail project outcomes and the allocations actually used by management. The results indicate that these models may be effective decision aids when used at appropriate project life cycle periods, with the choice of the particular model form being influenced by the manager's objectives and viewpoints of the project selection problem.

## 7. Multistage Production for Stochastic Seasonal Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of production planning for a seasonal good which is produced in a multistage manner (e.g., when one or more components must be produced or purchased with a lead time that is long compared to the sales season). During the selling season, lost Bales occur if demand cannot be satisfied; at the end of the season, leftover inventory incurs the usual overage cost. As the season progresses, the forecast of total demand is revised in light of current sales. The problem is to determine production quantities of the various components and assemblies at each period to minimize expected costs of underage and overage. If delivery is not required until the end of the selling (or “order-taking”) season, then a dynamic programming formulation can produce the optimal decision rule. However, for the case in which delivery is required during the season, the associated dynamic programming formulation is computationally infeasible. The paper explores four heuristics for the latter problem and compares their cost performance in a numerical example. The most sophisticated heuristic produces expected profits which range from 3.2% to 5.5% of an upper bound on expected profit.

## 8. A Class of Solutions for Group Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- P. L. Yu
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
Given a set of utility functions defined on a decision space for a group of individuals, we introduce the concept of utopia point for the group as well as the group regret of a feasible decision. The group regret of a decision varies with a class of distance functions. The class of solutions under study are those which minimize the group regret according to the class of distance functions. We investigate its properties from!he viewpoint of decision rationale. The bounds and monotonicity of the solutions together with their computation are also explored.

## 10. A Mathematical Programming Model for Test Construction and Scoring
### Author(s):
- Martin Feuerman
- Harvey Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1973
### Abstract:
A method is presented for test construction and scoring which utilizes the knapsack model of mathematical programming. The method applies to examinations of the type in which a choice exists in the number of questions the examinee is required to answer. The method has been utilized with respect to a Mathematics examination and computer generated results of this test are provided.
