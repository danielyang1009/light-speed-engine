## 1. A Program for Research on Management Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Richard O. Mason
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
An information system consists of, at least, a PERSON of a certain PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPE who faces a PROBLEM within some ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT for which he needs EVIDENCE to arrive at a solution, where the evidence is made available through some MODE OF PRESENTATION. This defines the key variables comprising a Management Information System (MIS). It is argued that most research and development to date on MIS has assumed only one underlying psychological type, one class of problem types, one or two methods of generating evidence, and, finally, one mode of presentation. Other states are suggested for all these key variables. The result is the outline of a systematic research program on MIS.

## 2. A Computational Approach to the Selection of an Optimal Network
### Author(s):
- Hoang Hai Hoc
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of selecting an optimal traffic network in its simplest form, where there are no congestion costs. The superadditive effect of deleted links on the objective function is pointed out and used to develop some implicit enumeration procedures for this problem. Some efforts are devoted to evaluate these algorithms, and to show how to stop the computations with an “acceptable” approximate solution when computations are taking too much time.

## 3. A Composite Heterogeneous Model for Brand Choice Behavior
### Author(s):
- J. Morgan Jones
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new, more general model of consumer brand choice behavior. The model is a composite of the Bernoulli, Markov, and Linear Learning Models, all of which have previously been proposed to represent brand choice behavior. The properties of the model are explored, and a parameter estimation technique is developed. A special case of the model is developed for situations in which insufficient data are available to estimate the parameters of the complete model.

## 4. An Inverse-Basis Method for Beale's Quadratic Programming Algorithm
### Author(s):
- A. H. Land
- G. Morton
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
This paper presents a version of Beale's Quadratic Programming Algorithm [Beale, E. M. L. 1959. On quadratic programming. Naval Res. Logist. Quart.6 227–243; Beale, E. M. L. 1967. Numerical methods. J. Abadie, ed. Nonlinear Programming. Amsterdam.] for solving a problem of maximising a quadratic function under linear constraints. The modification discussed here makes it possible to retain the “inverse basis” tableau which has to be augmented by additional constraints to be called “auxiliary.” The algorithm has been successfully tested on a computer.

## 5. Economic Lot Size Determination in Multi-Stage Assembly Systems
### Author(s):
- Wallace B. Crowston
- Michael Wagner
- Jack F. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
We consider the optimal lot size problem for multi-stage assembly systems where each facility may have many predecessors but only a single successor. Assumptions include constant continuous final product demand, instantaneous production, and an infinite planning horizon. Costs at each facility consist of a fixed charge per lot and a linear holding cost. Under the constraint that lot sizes remain time invariant, it is proven that the optimal lot size at each facility is an integer multiple of the lot size at the successor facility. This fact is used in the construction of a dynamic programming algorithm for the computation of optimal lot sizes. The algorithm exploits the concept of echelon stock [Clark, A. J., H. Scarf. 1960. Optimal policies for a multi-echelon inventory problem. Management Sci.6 (4, July) 475–490; Clark, A. J., H. Scarf. 1962. Approximate solution to a simple multi-echelon inventory problem. Chapter 5.

## 6. Improved Combinatorial Programming Algorithms for a Class of All-Zero-One Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- John F. Pierce
- Jeffrey S. Lasky
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
In an earlier paper [Pierce, J. F. 1968. Application of combinatorial programming to a class of all-zero-one integer programming problems. Management Sci.15 (3, November) 191–209.] combinatorial programming procedures were presented for solving a class of integer programming problems in which all elements are zero or one. By representing the problem elements in a binary computer as bits in a word and employing logical “and” and “or” operations in the problem-solving process, a number of problems involving several hundred integer variables were solved in a matter of seconds.

## 7. Optimal Sequencing of a Single Machine Subject to Precedence Constraints
### Author(s):
- E. L. Lawler
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
Suppose n jobs are each to be processed by a single machine, subject to arbitrary given precedence constraints. Associated with each job j is a known processing time aj, and a monotone nondecreasing cost function cj(t), giving the cost that is incurred by the completion of that job at time t. The problem is to find a sequence which will minimize the maximum of the incurred costs. An efficient computational procedure is given for this problem, generalizing and simplifying previous results of the present author and J. M. Moore.

## 8. Extensions of the Fundamental Theorem of Exponential Smoothing
### Author(s):
- Kenneth O. Cogger
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
The fundamental theorem of exponential smoothing is extended to include the nonasymptotic case where only a finite number of time series observations are available. This extension leads to the rigorous elimination of the present need for initial conditions in general order exponential smoothing forecasts. In addition, a computationally efficient procedure is presented for the calculation of all elements of the general order exponential smoothing coefficient matrix. These extensions of the fundamental theorem permit the applied use of general order exponential smoothing in a computationally efficient and unambiguous manner.

## 9. A Simple Continuous Review Deterministic One-Warehouse N-Retailer Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Leroy B. Schwarz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
A one-warehouse N-retailer deterministic inventory system is examined. The objective is to determine the stocking policy which minimizes average system cost per unit time over the infinite time horizon. Necessary properties of an optimal policy are derived, and optimal solutions for the one-retailer and N identical retailer problems are given. Heuristic solutions for the general problem are suggested, tested against analytical lower bounds and, on the basis of these tests, found to be near optimal.

## 10. Continuous-Review (s, S) Inventory Models with State-Dependent Leadtimes
### Author(s):
- Donald Gross
- Carl M. Harris
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
This paper describes the development of a continuous-review (s, S) inventory model with complete backordering and state-dependent, stochastic leadtimes. The demand on the inventory system is assumed to be a Poisson process, and the order-filling portion of the replenishment leadtime is allowed to depend on the number of outstanding orders (i.e., to be state dependent). The inventory state probabilities which are required in order to optimize the cost function with respect to s and S can be obtained via a queuing analysis on the order-filling process. Orders are assumed to arrive at a single-channel service facility, where the service may be state dependent in either one of two ways: (1) the instantaneous probabilities at an arbitrary point in time of an order being filled (i.e., a service completed) in an infinitesimal interval of length Δt is μ(m)Δt + o(Δt), where m is the number of outstanding orders (instantaneous state dependence); and (2) the order-filling time is an exponentially distributed random variable with distribution function Bn(t) = 1 − e−μ(n)t, where n is the number of outstanding orders just after the previous order has been filled (departure-point state dependence). The μ(·) used to illustrate the methodology is two state; that is, μ(·) = μ1 if only one order is outstanding and μ if more than one is outstanding. The appropriate queuing model describing the ordering process turns out to be a Poisson input, batch-service model with batch size Q = S − s. The instantaneous state-dependent model is analyzed using a Chapman-Kolmogorov approach, while the departure-point state-dependent model utilizes an imbedded-Markov-chain approach. The computational aspects of the models are illustrated for a specific set of values of the appropriate parameters.

## 11. The Effectiveness of Three Heuristic Rules for Job Sequencing in a Single Production Facility
### Author(s):
- R. D. Haynes
- C. A. Komar
- Jack Byrd, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
This paper examines the effectiveness of three heuristic rules used in production sequencing where the objective is to minimize the downtime due to setup changes. The effectiveness of these heuristic rules was evaluated under various conditions of job size and setup time distribution. The results of this analysis indicate that job conditions do affect the effectiveness of these three rules.

## 12. Note—A Comment on the Use of Simplex Method for Absolute Value Problems
### Author(s):
- Arunachalam Ravindran
- Thomas W. Hill, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
The linear programming approach to the absolute value problem is to transform the unrestricted variable by the difference of two nonnegative variables. This transformation creates an unbounded feasible region which may lead to erroneous solution. To avoid this, Kaplan [Kaplan, Seymour. 1971. Comment on a précis by Shanno and Weil. Management Sci.17 (11, July) 778–780.] introduced a new constraint to bound the feasible region and suggested a solution scheme using the simplex method. We shall give two counter examples to the proposed scheme and discuss the difficulties involved with this particular class of problem.

## 13. Note—Derivation from Queueing Theory of an Identity Related to Abel's Generalization of the Binomial Theorem, which is Useful in Graph Theory
### Author(s):
- Robert B. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
A well-known theorem of graph theory gives a simple formula for the calculation of the number of spanning trees of a complete graph with n labeled vertices. A well-known proof of this theorem uses a combinatorial identity, related to Abel's generalization of the binomial theorem, that is difficult to prove from first principles. It is the purpose of this note to observe that this identity is an easy consequence of an analysis of the busy period for the single-server queue with Poisson input and constant service times.

## 14. A Note on Parametric Network Flows
### Author(s):
- Edward Minieka
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1973
### Abstract:
In their paper [Doulliez, P. J., M. R. Rao. 1971. Maximal flow in a multi-terminal network with any one are subject to failure. Management Sci.18 (1, September) 48–58.], Doulliez and Rao present algorithms that solve two flow problems for a single source, multi-terminal network. The first problem that they solve is the construction of a flow that maximizes the value of t, where the demand at each sink is a nondecreasing, linear function of t. Given such a flow, the second problem that they solve is the construction of a flow that maximizes the value of t when the capacity of an arc is reduced. This paper supplies a finiteness proof for the first algorithm and sketches a finiteness proof for the second algorithm. The proofs are based on the well-known fact that a network possesses only a finite number of different spanning trees.
