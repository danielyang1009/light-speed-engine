## 1. Parallel Line Assignment Problems
### Author(s):
- Morton Klein
- Hiroshi Takamori
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
Two problems involving the assignment of men to jobs, in a production system with parallel lines, to maximize the steady state system production rate are studied. In the first, in which a man's production rate is independent of the line to which he is assigned, a simple rule “group the fastest men in the same line” is shown to be optimal. In the second, in which production rates are dependent on the production line, an algorithm is developed to obtain a solution.

## 2. Dialectical Decision Theory: A Meta-Theory of Decision-Making
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitrofff
- Frederick Betz
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
This paper presents a meta-logic of decision theory. It utilizes a dialectical formulation [Churchman, C. W. 1966. Hegelian inquiring systems. Internal Working Paper 49, Space Sciences Laboratory, Social Sciences Project, University of California, Berkeley, September; Mason, R. O. 1969. A dialectical approach to strategic planning. Management Sci.15(8, April) B-403–B-414; Mitroff, I. I. 1971. A communication model of dialectical inquiring systems—A strategy for strategic planning. Management Sci.17(10, June) B-634–648.] as a prescriptive methodology for minimizing statistical decision errors of the third kind; i.e., the error of solving the “wrong” decision problem when one should have solved the “right” problem. The dialectical formulation is chosen because it is the only existent methodological form which both utilizes conflict over value issues in a productive fashion and ensures a minimal sense of completeness in the decision-space of possible problem choice [Mitroff, I. I. On the general problem of building a generalized model of general models (in preparation).]. The result is the development of a meta-theory of decision-making. It is argued that the concept of a Dialectical Inquiring System [Mitroff, I. I. 1971. A communication model of dialectical inquiring systems—A strategy for strategic planning. Management Sci.17(10, June) B-634–648; Mitroff, I. I. On the general problem of building a generalized model of general models (in preparation).] is to our meta-theory of decision-making as the concept of a lottery [Pratt, J. W., H. Raiffa, R. Schlaifer. The foundations of decision under uncertainty: An elementary exposition. J. Amer. Stat. Assoc.59 353–375.] is to the ordinary theory of decision-making.

## 3. Substitution Effects in Geometric Programming
### Author(s):
- Henri Theil
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
The impact of price changes in geometric programming is analyzed in terms of technological substitution relationships. The method can also be applied to sensitivity analysis, which is illustrated by means of a numerical example.

## 4. Uncertain Value Functions
### Author(s):
- D. J. White
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
Value theory plays an essential role in the formal solution of decision problems, but the experimental determination of value functions is subject to errors of various kinds. Sensitivity analyses are methodologically invalid. An attempt is made to overcome the uncertainties in derivation of value functions, in a manner which is similar to the economist's “Pareto optimality” approach.

## 5. On Hyperbolic Programming with a Single Constraint and Upper-Bounded Variables
### Author(s):
- S. E. Elmaghraby
- S. Arisawa
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
The hyperbolic (or fractional) linear programming problem with only one aggregate constraint is solved by a simple and extremely efficient algorithm. The core step in the iterative procedure is the optimization of a linear function subject to a single linear constraint.

## 6. Asymptotic Optimal Policies for the Stochastic Sequential Assignment Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
Certain sets of numbers {ain}, i = 0,…, n, n = 1, 2,…, are known characterize an optimal sequential assignment policy. In this paper the limiting behavior as n → ∞ of the ain's is studied.

## 7. A Measure of an Individual's Power in a Group
### Author(s):
- Rami Hofshi
- James F. Korsh
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is presented for assigning numerical weights to each individual of an organization. The model is based on verbal definitions presently used in the social sciences to describe an individual's power or influence within a group of individuals. Thus the numerical weights derived can be interpreted as measures of the power or influence that individuals have in an organization.

## 8. Interactive Goal Programming
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
The use of goal programming for the solution of the multiple criteria problem is discussed. An extension of this use is presented in the form of an algorithm which requires interaction with the relevant decision-maker in order to obtain certain information regarding his utility function defined over the permissible values of the criteria. This algorithm provides a bridge between goal programming and recently suggested interactive strategies for the optimization of the multiple criteria problem.

## 9. Optimal Scheduiing of Two Consecutive Idle Periods
### Author(s):
- R. Tibrewala
- D. Philippe
- J. Browne
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
It is shown that a simple algorithm provides optimal solutions to problems of scheduling men or equipment to meet cyclic requirements over periods where each man or machine must be idle for two consecutive periods per cycle. An example illustrates the application to scheduling to meet seven distinct daily requirements per week using employees for five consecutive work days.

## 10. Economic Design of T2 Control Charts to Maintain Current Control of a Process
### Author(s):
- Douglas C. Montgomery
- Phillip J. Klatt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
An approximate cost model for a quality control procedure for two or more related variables is investigated. A method is presented to determine the optimal sample size, interval between samples, and critical region parameter for the Hotelling T2 control chart. This model is a multivariate analog of several well-known models for the univariate X̄-chart. It is assumed that only one assignable cause of variation exists and the time between occurrences is exponentially distributed. Numerical results are provided in a particular bivariate case for several values of the cost coefficients. The behavior of the model to variation of the model parameters is discussed.

## 11. More on Conditioned Sampling in the Simulation of Stochastic Networks
### Author(s):
- Mark B. Garman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
The technique of conditioned sampling has been shown to improve simulation efficiency in the estimation of stochastic activity network duration c.d.f.'s. This paper describes a.method for generalizing the conditioned sampling approach from its current use of product-form estimators to the use of product/convolution-form estimators. Estimators of the latter type are constructed and demonstrated to require fewer samples per realization (hence increased estimation accuracy) in almost all networks. An algorithm for estimator construction is presented and proven to apply to any given activity network. It is also shown that the derived product/convolution-form estimators may require a precedence structure within the sampling sequence which creates their corresponding realizations.

## 12. The Minimum Covering Sphere Problem
### Author(s):
- D. Jack Elzinga
- Donald W. Hearn
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
The minimum covering sphere problem, with applications in location theory, is that of finding the sphere of smallest radius which encloses a set of points in En. For a finite set of points, it is shown that the Wolfe dual is equivalent to a particular quadratic programming problem and that converse duality holds. A finite decomposition algorithm, based on the Simplex method of quadratic programming, is developed for which computer storage requirements are independent of the number of points and computing time is approximately linear in the number of points.

## 13. Structuring Information Flow to Enhance Innovation
### Author(s):
- Norman R. Baker
- James R. Freeland
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1972
### Abstract:
Empirical work in industrial research organizations has provided data useful for better understanding researcher behavior during innovation. The role of information during idea creation and idea submission is described based on these data. A model of a management information system is structured which is consistent with and supportive of researcher behavior and which includes technical planning, project selection, and manpower planning. The critical problems of information search and dissemination are examined.
