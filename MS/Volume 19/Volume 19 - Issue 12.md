### Abstract:
This paper discusses the methods and the results of a forecast for the demand for operative and obstetrical procedures and the supply of anesthesiologists in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The techniques and results of a ten-year forecast for the demand for and supply of anesthesiologists and auxiliary personnel in greater Cleveland are discussed. Several regression models were used to forecast supply based on population, number of physicians, and the income per capita. The demand models were based on population, age and sex distribution projections, and historical data regarding operative and obstetrical procedures. The results of these “objective” models were then compared to forecasts under uncertainty generated by a panel of experts using the Delphi Method. Alternative states of health care delivery were investigated and implications for future anesthesiologist manpower requirements detailed.

## 2. Forecasting and Systems Approach: A Frame of Reference
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Long range forecasting for social systems deals with complex feedback interactions between all sectors and elements of such systems, and thus inherently implies facing the challenge of the systems approach. The latter may be characterised as an attempt to understand the self-organizing behaviour of social systems and to grasp its potential dynamic implications. It aims at integration at least along four coordinates: horizontal (conceptual systems dimensions and different views and attitudes), vertical (planning levels), time/causality (exploratory and normative directions), and action-orientation (forecasting as the “inventive core” of planning and rational change processes). In this process of integration, forecasting finds a variety of tasks which are briefly enumerated.

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
An inverse square-root function is developed for the relation between average response distance and the number of locations at which response units are stationed in a region. Analysis of theoretical models, simulation data, and empirical measurements are used to confirm the square-root model.

## 4. A Time-Sharing Computer Program for the Solution of the Multiple Criteria Problem
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
This note presents a description of a time-sharing computer program written to implement a man-machine interactive algorithm for the solution of the multiple criteria problem. The interactive algorithm was suggested in a recent paper by Geoffrion, “Vector Maximal Decomposition Programming,” Working Paper No. 164, Western Management Science Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, September 1970. A unique feature of this program is the man-machine dialog which obtains information from the decision-maker through a series of simple, ordinal comparisons.

## 5. Utility and Perceived Acceptability of R&D Project Selection Models
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
The analytical utility and managerial acceptability of three expected value maximizing (EV) project selection model forms were assessed within five different development R&D performing organizations. Utility was assessed in terms of the capabilities of the models for prescribing higher value portfolios than those actually implemented by the R&D managers. Value was expressed in terms of profit, return on investment, expenditures on unsuccessful efforts and funds unexpended. Acceptability was measured in terms of the manager's willingness to adopt the models on the bases of their assessed utilities, their general performances and their perceived attributes. Although one of the EV model forms was found to have high utility with regard to all five organizations studied, it was acceptable in only two of these organizations. In general, high utility was not found to be either an inherent characteristic of these EV model forms or an important consideration for their adoption by the R&D managers. Overall, the models were largely irrelevant and managerially unacceptable with respect to the development projects and the selection/allocation processes studied here.

## 6. Media Scheduling: A Stochastic Dynamic Model Approach
### Author(s):
- Fred S. Zufryden
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
A stochastic model is developed with application to both the study of consumer behavior and the scheduling of advertising media. This model incorporates a stochastic response behavior model which examines changes in brand purchase probability over time through the integration of consumer advertising exposure response, purchase incidence behavior and purchase-event feedback constructs. The response behavior model provides the basis for the objective function of a general media scheduling model that is formulated as a binary integer mathematical programming system. Among the factors considered or reflected in the media model are the sales potentials of the target audience and respective market segments, advertising budget, media timing, exposure probabilities, and time patterns (e.g., advertising carry-over, forgetting and saturation effects). Finally, efficient heuristic programming techniques are proposed for solving the media model.

## 7. A Model for Cash Balance Management
### Author(s):
- Daniel P. Heyman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
A model for minimizing the average cash balance subject to a constraint on the probability of stock-out is presented. The cash balance is described as an inventory process that changes because of deterministic and stochastic events. Recursive systems of equations are given to find (1) the distribution function of the cash level at any time and (2) the probability that all demands during some time interval are met. Then we examine the problem: minimize the expected time average cash balance subject to the condition that the probability that all demands are satisfied is at least some given number. It is shown that the optimal policy has a very simple form, which can be expressed verbally as, “never have any more cash on hand than is necessary to satisfy the constraint.”

## 8. Distributional Constraints in Public Expenditure Planning
### Author(s):
- Martin Feldstein
- Harold Luft
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
Distributional aspects are of primary importance in the design of many of our largest public programs. National health insurance, low-income housing subsidies, grants for higher education and payments for income maintenance all emphasize the use of public expenditure to alter the distribution of real resources among income classes. The traditional cost-benefit approach, with its focus on the efficiency of resource use, is inadequate for dealing with such programs. Moreover, the basic problem of choice in these programs is not the selection of one of several mutually exclusive projects but the design of optimal income-related schedules of benefits and charges.

## 9. An Experimental Analysis of Network Planning
### Author(s):
- William R. King
- Paul A. Lukas
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
This study (1) tests some basic hypotheses related to the use of historical estimating behavioral information in network planning, and (2) makes comparative evaluations of a number of network planning techniques. Since a number of previous studies have evaluated similar hypotheses and techniques to a limited degree using data from real-world projects, this study utilizes a laboratory experiment as a means of generating data which have a richer potential for analysis. Although the results are not conclusive, the study further suggests the potential value of using historical estimating behavior as a basis for “adjusting” the single time estimates made by an individual or group and/or using a single-estimate simulation approach rather than using a multiple estimate approaches such as PERT.

### Published:

### Abstract:
A mathematical model has been developed for the purpose of assisting R&D management in the crucial task of allocating manpower resources to a set of competing pharmaceutical research programs. The problem is formulated such that the optimal manpower allocations among competing research programs are obtained through the use of a standard dynamic programming algorithm. A utility function is developed which allows for variations in the size, timing, and costs of the potential products from the various research programs. The model has been implemented on a digital computer, and the inputs and outputs are demonstrated through an example case. The model has been in existence for four years and is utilized quite extensively during the planning and budgeting cycles.

## 11. Determination of Excess Stock Quantities
### Author(s):
- Anthony Hart
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
A procedure is described which can be used as an aid in solving the following problem: given excess stock of an inventory item, how much should be disposed of at a scrap price, and how much should be retained for regular sale, in order to minimize the present value of all the relevant costs. The minimum cost retention quantity is determined using a sequential search procedure based on the “Golden Section.” For each retention quantity considered, a procurement schedule is determined heuristi-cally according to a set of rules based on economic order quantities and economic “bridging” quantities. The costs associated with the determined procurement schedule and the scrap and retention quantities are discounted and summed to give the total present value cost. The heuristic method of determining procurement schedules is compared with a dynamic programming method. The results of applying the procedure to some inventory items are given.

## 12. A Simple Style Goods Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- Philip H. Hartung
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
A Style Goods Inventory Model is presented as a dynamic inventory problem with unknown demand. Assumptions are introduced which allow the model to be solved as a dynamic programming problem with one state variable instead of two. Application of the model is made through the development of a particular empirical demand estimating process. Further, the model is defined such that the results can be applied to a class of items with dissimilar costs and demand levels.

## 13. A Note on the Possibility of Decentralization in a Model of Allocation of Resources
### Author(s):
- Pradip Maiti
- Ramprasad Sengupta
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1973
### Abstract:
The decomposition algorithm for the solution of large-scale linear programmes has been interpreted by Baumol and Fabian (Management Science, September, 1964) as a procedure for decentralized decision by the multi-division company or the multi-sector economy. While commenting on the possibility of decentralization in this context, they maintain that an economy's optimum point will not in general yield a sectoral optimum. The present note demonstrates that this contention is not valid.
