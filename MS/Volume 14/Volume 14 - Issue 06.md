## 2. A Markovian Analysis of the Life of Newspaper Subscriptions
### Author(s):
- W. Edwards Deming
- Gerald J. Glasser
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents a case study in the application of some statistical theory, and a mathematical model, to an actual business problem. The problem was to determine the pattern of mortality of subscriptions to a daily newspaper, and thereby to ascertain the average life of such subscriptions. The method of solution, here with indicated, involved the collection of data from a probability sample of subscribers to the newspaper, and use of these data to construct a Markov chain.

## 3. Maximizing Insurance Buyers' Utility
### Author(s):
- Morris Hamburg
- William F. Matlack
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents a normative analysis of the purchase of insurance by deducing decision rules for the purchase of the correct amounts and kinds of insurance by consumers. The merits of different types of insurance policies are evaluated in terms of consumers who possess concave downward quadratic utility functions. Such consumers represent one class of risk-avoiders in the classical sense of making choices under uncertainty which indicate diminishing marginal utilities for money.

## 4. The Growth Period Decision
### Author(s):
- Harold Bierman, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
Economists have for many years been interested in the problem of finding the optimum investment period for an appreciating or growing asset. Two basic solutions have been offered: maximization of the present value of the asset's anticipated earnings stream (for example, recommended by Irving Fisher) and maximization of the asset's internal rate of return (for example, recommended by Kenneth Boulding). This paper discusses the results of using the present value and rate of return procedures and suggests a desirable modification to the present value approach recommended by Fisher.

## 5. Transfer Pricing in a Decentralized Firm
### Author(s):
- Jerome E. Hass
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
Ronald Howard's editorial comments in the June, 1967 volume of this journal stressed the power of the pricing mechanism in the control and optimization of social systems. This article illustrates how such a concept can be applied via a decomposition algorithm for quadratic programming. A set of artificial markets for scarce resources and transfer goods is introduced into a model of a divisionalized firm and a quadratic decomposition algorithm is used to find the optimal (profit maximizing) set of prices for these goods. The algorithm requires a minimal amount of information transmission from the divisions to corporate headquarters and can be applied to divisionalized firms operating in imperfect markets. It also has significant behavioral implications not found in other decomposition algorithms for the firm which employs a profit-center method of control. The value of the algorithm is evident in those situations where decentralization is either desirable or a necessity and where interdependencies exist.

## 6. The Effect of Worker Productivity on Production Smoothing
### Author(s):
- M. G. Orrbeck
- D. R. Schuette
- H. E. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
In this paper the assumptions of constant wages and productivity in the production smoothing problem are dropped in favor of a model which explicitly treats changes in them through employee experience. The model is an extension of the Hanssmann-Hess model and hence the necessary transformation to convert the problem into linear programming format are provided. Finally some numerical calculations are made to illustrate the use of the model. These calculations suggest that when the difference in productivity between old and new workers is quite large, as would be the case in a skilled-labor-intensive industry, the extended model represents a substantial improvement over the original Hanssmann-Hess model.

## 7. A Search Decision Rule for the Aggregate Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- William H. Taubert
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a search decision rule (SDR) approach to the aggregate scheduling problem. The approach is tested by converting the objective function of the classic Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon paint factory scheduling problem into a 20 dimension response surface which is then explored by the SDR. Conjugate gradient, variable metric and pattern search methods are tested. All three methods demonstrate the ability to consistently descend to the neighborhood of the minimum. The pattern search technique is selected for incorporation into the SDR heuristic because of its excellent performance in terms of reducing the computation time required. Production and work force decisions made up by the SDR are comparable to those made by the linear decision rule and total costs are within 0.1%. By means of the search decision rule approach it should be possible to eliminate the restrictions imposed by linear and quadratic cost models and thereby pursue a more general and realistic approach to the aggregate scheduling problem.

## 8. The Implementation of Process Models
### Author(s):
- C. F. Fiore
- R. T. Rozwadowski
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
The article focuses attention on the problems encountered in formulating and using process mathematical models in an industrial environment. A model of an actual lime factory is used for descriptive purposes. The linear programming technique is employed to illustrate the simulation of the plant. The paper does not try to explain the mathematics of linear programming or any other technique used to simulate the activities of a plant. The aim of the writers is rather to outline the steps taken in formulating a plant model and what can be done with it. This paper is mainly concerned, therefore, with the managerial, engineering and cost accounting problems encountered. The linear programming technique is applied here mainly because of its wide range of applications. Much of what is described may be of value to persons using other methods.

## 9. Management Science in University Operation
### Author(s):
- Gustave J. Rath
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
The major investment in education has led to a major interest in the analysis of universities. Industrial engineering departments and computing centers have been bringing new technologies to bear on scheduling, sectioning and modeling of schools. Institutional research organizations are beginning to analyze and evaluate schools. Current analysis of these fields shows that much work is required on operations and a breakthrough is needed on the measurement of educational quality.

## 13. Marketing Science
### Author(s):
- Kenneth A. Longman
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1968
### Abstract:
—“The Markov visitation” (It often seems as if the basic tool of operations research in marketing is the Markov chain. There are few O.R. people who have looked into marketing who haven't attempted to apply the tool.) Researchers have also invented a variety of ways to deal with variable purchase intervals, some as simple as using two chains which interweave. One assesses whether a purchase will be made in the next time interval and the second deals with the brand choice.
