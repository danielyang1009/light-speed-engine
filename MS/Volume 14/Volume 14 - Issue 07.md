## 1. An Appreciation of Industrial Dynamics
### Author(s):
- H. Igor Ansoff
- Dennis P. Slevin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
Industrial Dynamics is a recently developed and fast moving area of management analysis. Since its inception it has gained both staunch opponents and severe critics. This paper is an attempt at an impartial appreciation of Industrial Dynamics. The model-building process employed in ID is briefly described. The ID is discussed as a simulation approach to problem solving. The strengths, the apparent shortcomings and areas of applicability are discussed. Next a question is raised regarding ID's claim to the status of a “general systems theory.” It is suggested that little evidence to date qualifies ID to be viewed as a distinctive body of theory about behavior of firms.

## 2. Industrial Dynamics—After the First Decade
### Author(s):
- Jay W. Forrester
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
Industrial dynamics, described as the application of feedback concepts to social systems, is evolving toward a theory of structure in systems as well as being an approach to corporate policy design. In high-order, nonlinear systems, with multiple loops and both positive and negative feedback, are found the modes of behavior which have been so puzzling in management and economics. The time is at hand when more sharply defined concepts and principles can form a core through management education to interrelate the functional areas and to move from static to dynamic understanding of systems. To do so should help close the gap between what the management school can now teach and what the manager must understand if he is to successfully cope with the increasing complexity of our society.

## 3. Information Processing Model of Executive Decision
### Author(s):
- John A. Howard
- William M. Morgenroth
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
Company information systems demand a better understanding of the nature of the executive's decision process. Above all his information requirements must be specified. The capacity to specify these requirements is the hallmark of the information-processing model. An example of the form of the simulation of a pricing decision process is presented. The model, a binary flow chart type, simulates the pricing decision in a differentiated oligopolistic market. The validity of the model is established by comparing the two kinds of predictions that it makes—output and process—with reality. A number of problems encountered in developing models of this type are discussed. Some of the broader implications of these models are described and others are briefly mentioned.

## 4. Minimum Concave Cost Flows in Certain Networks
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
The literature is replete with analyses of minimum cost flows in networks for which the cost of shipping from node to node is a linear function. However, the linear cost assumption is often not realistic. Situations in which there is a set-up charge, discounting, or efficiencies of scale give rise to concave functions. Although concave functions can be minimized by an exhaustive search of all the extreme points of the convex feasible region, such an approach is impractical for all but the simplest of problems. In this paper some theorems are developed which explicitly characterize the extreme points for certain single commodity networks. By exploiting this characterization algorithms are developed that determine the minimum concave cost solution for networks with a single source and a single destination, for acyclic single source multiple destination networks, and for acyclic single destination multiple source networks. An interesting theorem then establishes that for either single source or single destination networks the multi-commodity case can be reduced to the single commodity case. Applications to the concave warehouse problem, a single product production and inventory model, a multi-product production and inventory model, and a plant location problem are included.

## 5. Separable Markovian Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- Eric V. Denardo
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
The special structure of a class of Markovian decision problems is exploited to simplify the determination of optimum policies. For certain pairs consisting of a state i and decision k, the cost cki separates (cki = ai + bk), while the transition probabilities pkij and transition time distributions Fkij are independent of i. Equivalence of a second Markovian decision problem which exploits this structure is demonstrated for the discounted and averaging cases. In addition, streamlined approaches are presented for dealing directly with the original problem, and a particular inventory model is further simplified.

## 6. Sales and Restocking Policies in a Single Item Inventory System
### Author(s):
- Richard V. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
A single product system with linear costs is considered when customers are of two different types. Penalty costs for lost sales differ for the two types of customers and; therefore, optimal system control requires different shortage probabilities for the two classes. In one case, high penalty customers independently arrive while at the other extreme it is assumed that there is only one such customer. Single critical number policies are optimal in the simple situations. If the priority type customers become active and register displeasure by changing their demand pattern when their demands are not satisfied, simple convexity or Polya frequency function arguments are not sufficient to guarantee that the optimal policy remains one of the single critical number variety.

## 7. A Study of Consumer Behavior by use of Competitive Business Games
### Author(s):
- Gifford H. Symonds
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
The behavior of consumers, labor, investors, and community members in a simulated society has been studied by use of competitive business games. The model for the simulation represents a closed economic system with firms in an oligopolistic industry operating by a set of anticipatory decision rules and a number of household communities whose decisions are made by players who identify themselves with the welfare of their communities. The product price and product sales each period are determined by equating the aggregate supply function of the firms and the aggregate demand function of the household communities. The wage rates and employment each period are determined by matching offers of the firms with offers of the household communities.

## 8. Games with Incomplete Information Played by ‘Bayesian’ Players, Part III. The Basic Probability Distribution of the Game
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
Parts I and II of this paper have described a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information. Two cases have been distinguished: consistent games in which there exists some basic probability distribution from which the players' subjective probability distributions can be derived as conditional probability distributions; and inconsistent games in which no such basic probability distribution exists. Part III will now show that in consistent games, where a basic probability distribution exists, it is essentially unique.

## 9. Observations & Opinions The Practicality Gap
### Author(s):
- Ronald A. Howard
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
The topic, “The Interface Between Management Science and Managers,” sounds as if it should make a certain amount of sense, and yet sometimes I worry. If I referred to “The Interface Between Physics and the Motorist,” “The Interface Between Aeronautical Science and the Airline Pilot,” or “The Interface Between Nuclear Science and the Reactor Owner,” you would say, “ Well, it seems to me that there is such a gap in these cases, that we almost need a whole new profession to fill it.” Well, that's the point of my letter.

## 10. Communication to the Editor—An Equilibrium Property of Finite-Population Queues
### Author(s):
- Paul J. Schweitzer
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1968
### Abstract:
The purpose of this note is to extend, by means of a somewhat simpler derivation, a result of Sherbrooke [Sherbrooke, C. C. 1966. Generalization of a queueing theorem of palm to finite populations. Management Sci.12(11, July) 907–908.] to the case of arbitrary arrival distributions, arbitrary in the sense that customers are distinguishable and may have different density functions of holding time and interarrival time.
