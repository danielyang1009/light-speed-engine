### Published:

### Abstract:
In this paper we study a model that minimizes the sum of production, employment smoothing, and inventory costs subject to a schedule of known demand requirements over a finite time horizon. The three instrumental variables are work force producing at regular-time, work force producing on overtime, and the total work force. Overtime is limited to be not more than a fixed multiple of regular time. The idle portion of the work force and the levels of inventory are resultant variables. We postulate the following shape characteristics for the cost functions production costs are convex-like, smoothing costs are V-shaped, and holding costs are increasing, both the production and holding cost functions need not be stationary. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the cumulative regular-time plus overtime work force for any sequence of demand requirements. We also give the form of an optimal policy when demands are monotone (either increasing or decreasing). Finally, we derive the asymptotic behavior of optimal policies when demands are monotone and the planning horizon becomes arbitrarily long. All of these results, which convey information about the numerical values of optimal policies, given specific demands and an initial level of inventory, depend only on the shape characteristics of the cost functions. Algorithmic techniques are discussed elsewhere [Lippman, S. A., A. J. Rolfe, H. M. Wagner, J. S. C. Yuan. Algorithms for optimal production scheduling and employment smoothing. Opns Res. To appear.], [Yuan, J. S. C. 1967. Algorithms and multi-product model in production scheduling and employment smoothing. Technical Report 22 (NSF GS-552), Stanford University, August.].

## 2. Games with Incomplete Information Played by “Bayesian” Players, I–III Part I. The Basic Model
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities.

## 3. Some Special P-Models in Chance-Constrained Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- M. J. L. Kirby
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
This paper establishes sufficient conditions for decision rules to be optimal for two n-penod P-models of chance-constrained programming. The models considered are the triangular model with total probability constraints and the block triangular model with conditional probability constraints. It is shown that, for both these models, a sufficient condition for optimality is that the decision rule be the optimal piecewise linear rule. Proofs of theorems are based on results contained in earlier papers by the authors, on n-penod E-models of chance-constrained programming.

## 4. Multiple (s, S) Policies and the n-Period Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Edward S. Boylan
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
In a previous paper the concept of a multiple (s, S, policy, generalizing the well-known (s, S) policy, was introduced, and it was shown that for a broad class of situations some multiple (s, S) policy would minimize costs when a single decision was to be made whether or not to order goods to add to inventory. In the present paper it is shown that when n such decisions must be made, some multiple (s, S) policy will minimize total (discounted) costs, though under slightly more restrictive conditions.

## 5. A Primal Method for Minimal Cost Flows with Applications to the Assignment and Transportation Problems
### Author(s):
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
A simple procedure is given for solving minimal cost flow problems in which feasible flows are maintained throughout. It specializes to give primal algorithms for the assignment and transportation problems. Convex cost problems can also be handled.

## 6. The Convex Simplex Method
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method, called the convex simplex method, for minimizing a convex objective function subject to linear inequality constraints. The method is a true generalization of Dantzig's linear simplex method both in spirit and in the fact that the same tableau and variable selection techniques are used. With a linear objective function the convex simplex method reduces to the linear simplex method. Moreover, the convex simplex method actually behaves like the linear simplex method whenever it encounters a linear portion of a convex objective function. Many of the sophisticated techniques designed to enhance the efficiency of the linear simplex method are applicable to the convex simplex method. In particular, as an example, a network transportation problem with a convex objective function is solved by using the standard transportation tableau and by only slightly modifying the usual procedure for a linear objective function.

## 7. Regional Rain Models with Space- and Time-Correlated Structure
### Author(s):
- Eric E. Sorensen
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
Many activities combining the interactions between man and machine are influenced by a third factor of weather. The sensitivity analysis required to explore the complicated effects of weather is important in evaluating situations when man-machine strategies are constructed to arrive at optimal operations. The influence of rain on the harvesting of crops is one such situation. A generalized model has been constructed which will simulate rainfall over regions containing gradient extremes of annual rainfall of 5 inches to 50 inches within the region for any given year.

## 9. Communications to the Editor
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1967
### Abstract:
Following publication of my paper entitled (Fife, Dennis W. 1965. Scheduling with random arrivals and linear loss functions. Management Sci.11 (3, January) 429–437.), a private comment on it was received by the Editor. I responded to this, also in a private communication to the Editor. However the Editor has now suggested that a published statement from me would be appropriate to close the matter.
