## 1. Gaming: Costs and Facilities
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
During the past ten years there has been a proliferation in the use of gaming as an experimental, teaching, and operational device. The consensus has been that in all three activities it has been of use. Many hundreds of games have been constructed and have been or are currently in use for a variety of purpose; for example, a recent publication gives summaries of eighty-nine business games. In spite of the considerable activity in gaming, little has been published on its costs. In the activities to which gaming has been applied, there have been or are well established alternatives methods for which the costs and worth are more or less known. It is in the light of these and possibly other alternatives that we must view the developments in gaming.

## 2. Technological Change and Learning in the Computer Industry
### Author(s):
- James L. Barr
- Kenneth E. Knight
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
Recent papers have introduced specific input variables in unrestricted Cobb-Douglas functions to define production relationships and obtain measures of technological change for industries and sector classifications.1 In a similar manner this paper incorporates the engineering, economic, and time aspects of the production process for the computer industry in several statistical models. The purpose of the study is to illustrate that technological change can be accounted for by specific innovations of the industry and that these measures can serve as measures of capital embodied technological change.

## 3. Demon Mark II: Extremal Equations Solution & Approximation
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- J. K. Devoe
- D. B. Learner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
This paper develops a new method for the solution of DEMON-type functional equations. It is shown how the latter can be reduced to solution of a separated system of simpler equations which, for discrete distributions, can be solved by linear programming methods. The reduction also permits general characteristics of the solutions to be inferred. Additionally, methods of approximation and bounding are developed and interpreted for the general case.

## 4. Steady State Solution of the Queue M/Ek/r
### Author(s):
- J. O. Mayhugh
- R. E. Mccormick
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
The multiserver queue with Poisson arrivals and Erlangian, gamma or chi-square service time is solved for the steady state case. A general procedure, adaptable to computer programming, for writing the equations for the state probabilities is given. Generating functions for the time invariant state probabilities are found. A method of computing numerical solutions is described.

## 6. Observations & Opinions—Will Management Be Automated By 1975
### Author(s):
- Louis T. Rader
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
So, will management be automated by 1975? To the extent that automation means systems planning (and it does) the answer is yes. To the extent that automation means the utilization through investment of the latest machines to help do the required wok (and it does) the answer is yes. To the extent that automation means flexible and fast reaction to customer needs (and it does) the answer is yes. To the extent that automation means the utilization of mathematical techniques beyond that of simple arithmetic (and it does) the answer is yes. To the extent that automation means that all decisions can be made in advance; that people are not the most important ingredient in a business; that business judgment, skill and entrepreneurship are not needed (and it does not mean these things), management will not be automated by 1975 or ever.

## 7. Communications to the Editor—Some Comments On Training for the Future of the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Albert H. Rubenstein
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
Some of the major issues discussed by the panel members at this meeting are summarized. Among them are: The role of social sciences in management science; role differentiation of the manager, the management scientist and the management researcher; and the need for increased study of values and objectives. Certain difficulties in defining and resolving these issues are discussed.

## 8. Communications to the Editor—A Note on the Shapley Value
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Owen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
In Shapley, L. S. 1953. Additive and non-additive set functions. Ph.D. thesis, Department of Mathematics, Princeton University, Shapley considers a modification of his power index. The modified values are introduced via special weights. This note suggests that those weights should be thought of as coefficients of slowness to reach decision.

## 9. Communications to the Editor—A Stochastic Bottleneck Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- Uri Yechiali
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1968
### Abstract:
Consider an n-job stochastic bottleneck assignment problem in which the production rates are independent random variables rather than constants. Assume that the production rate, Rij, (Rij ≧ 0; i, j = 1, 2, …, n) of man i when assigned to job j is: (1) exponentially distributed with mean 1/λij or (2) Weibull distributed with scale parameter λij and shape parameter β. It is shown that in either case, the assignment that maximizes the expected rate of the entire line is found by solving the deterministic assignment problem with “cost” matrix [λij].
