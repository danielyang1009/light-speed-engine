## 1. Inter-Temporal Portfolio Analysis Based on Simulation of Joint Returns
### Author(s):
- Kalman J. Cohen
- Edwin J. Elton
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
An inter-temporal quadratic programming model for selecting portfolios of risky assets is formulated. The model's application to capital budgeting is discussed in considerable detail. This is followed by briefer discussions of its application in other areas. The paper develops a new and more efficient way of using simulation to calculate the variance-covariance elements required as input to Markowitz-type models; this new procedure makes no further demands on the decision maker than do other simulation models that have been suggested. The paper also shows how such models can be made inter-temporal. Finally, the paper analyzes the potentials for extending such models to include other theoretical considerations that have been proposed in the literature.

## 2. The Cascade Algorithm for Finding all Shortest Distances in a Directed Graph
### Author(s):
- B. A. Farbey
- A. H. Land
- J. D. Murchland
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
Matrix methods for finding shortest distances are convenient and efficient when the lengths of shortest paths are wanted between all pairs of vertices in a graph. The Cascade algorithm requires substantially fewer operations to find these distances than does the standard matrix method.

## 3. The Extension of the Cascade Algorithm to Large Graphs
### Author(s):
- A. H. Land
- S. W. Stairs
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
Large graphs for which the calculation of the shortest distances between all vertices is required often consist of several parts with limited interconnections. This paper shows how this characteristic may be used to reduce computer storage for a matrix type calculation, to reduce calculations] labour, and to provide results in a form which is particularly convenient if a subsequent assignment of commodity flow to shortest paths is needed. The technique presented here allows the partition to be arbitrary, save for a single, easily achieved, condition.

## 4. Chance-Constrained Programming with 0-1 or Bounded Continuous Decision Variables
### Author(s):
- Fredrick S. Hillier
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
This paper considers the chance-constrained programming problem where the decision variables can be either bounded and continuous or restricted to be either zero or one, and where some or all of the parameters are random variables that may be statistically dependent. Both exact and approximate solution procedures are presented, where most of these are based on several linear inequalities that permit this problem to be approximated by a number of ordinary (integer or noninteger) linear programming problems. Either zero-order or linear decision rules are allowed for the continuous variables, and a general method of making “second-stage decisions” with either continuous or 0-1 variables is developed.

## 5. An Algorithm for the Chebyshev Problem—With an Application to Concave Programming
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
The Chebyshev problem is to determine a point xα which solves maxα min i = 1,…, N{gi(x)}. By exploiting generalized inverses an algorithm is developed for determining xα. It is also shown that in a certain sense the Chebyshev problem is equivalent to the concave programming problem. Moreover, for the programming problem generated by the Chebyshev problem, the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are proven to be sufficient even though the feasible region may not be convex.

## 6. On the Analysis of Critical Path Time Estimating Behavior
### Author(s):
- William R. King
- Donald M. Wittevrongel
- Karl D. Hezel
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
This paper presents some results of an analysis of time estimating behavior on critical path networks used in large scale development projects. The general results appear to confirm the validity of the tentative conclusions previously reported by King and Wilson [King, W. R., T. A. Wilson. 1967. Subjective time estimates in critical path planning—-A preliminary analysis. Management Sci.13(5, January).]. The objective of the historical analysis is to test the potential of adjustment models based on historical estimating behavior. If such models can be developed, the utility of critical path techniques should be greatly enhanced.

## 7. Allocation of Resources to Research Proposals
### Author(s):
- Frederick Hartmann
- Sidney Moglewer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
A model is presented for the allocation of company resources to research proposals. The approach is based upon the theory of games and focuses upon the uncertainties of contract funding and their effect on company policy. A general solution is derived for a game in which the payoff function for each proposal exhibits a diminishing return. An algorithm to obtain quick numerical solutions with a slide rule is also given. Data taken from the literature for the proposal activity of an aerospace company over a period of three years show good agreement between actual and calculated expenditures. Finally, the mini-max strategy used in two-person games is compared with policies based on other decision criteria and is shown to have a pivotal place in the planning process.

## 8. Evaluating a Call Option and Optimal Timing Strategy in the Stock Market
### Author(s):
- Howard M. Taylor
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1967
### Abstract:
The optimal strategy for the holder of a “put” or “call” option contract in the stock market is studied under the random walk model for stock prices. Some results are distribution-free in that they depend only on the mean price change. Other results are derived under the assumption that price changes have a normal or Gaussian distribution. Under this assumption explicit results are obtained for the limiting case where the expiration date of the contract is indefinitely far in the future. Knowing the optimal strategy it is possible to evaluate whether the purchase of a given option can be expected to be profitable.
