## 1. A Replenishment Model for Radioactive Nuclide Generators
### Author(s):
- Hamilton Emmons
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
The nuclide generator is a radioactive element of long half life which is used to produce a short-lived daughter, or decay product, useful in medical diagnosis. This paper discusses the inventory problem for such exponentially decaying substances. Methods are proposed for finding the optimizing replenishment size when the reorder point, replenishment cost function, and other parameters are given. The reorder point is determined by certain medical requirements which give rise to a rather complicated model. A simple method is presented for finding close bounds on the required solution.

## 2. Information Structures in Stochastic Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Koichi Miyasawa
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
Problems of multi-stage decision under uncertainty are usually classified into “stochastic” and “adaptive” ones, depending on whether the decision maker does or does not know the relevant probability distribution. If the Bayesian approach is taken, then, in the adaptive case, the decision maker is assumed to know the prior distribution of certain parameters. It is shown in the paper that the adaptive case is then reducible to the stochastic one.

## 3. Turnpike Planning Horizons for a Markovian Decision Model
### Author(s):
- Jeremy F. Shapiro
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
This paper establishes some asymptotic properties of the finite state and action space Markovian decision model. For the discounted case, a turnpike theorem is proven which states that an optimal immediate decision when the planning horizon is sufficiently large is to choose one of the decisions which is optimal when the planning horizon is infinite. An upper bound on how large is sufficiently large is given. An asymptotic property of the model for discount factors in a neighborhood of one is also developed.

## 5. Golden Block Search for the Maximum of Unimodal Functions
### Author(s):
- Mordecai Avriel
- Douglass J. Wilde
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
In a previous paper [Avriel, M., D. J. Wilde. 1966. Optimal search for a maximum with sequences of simultaneous function evaluations. Management Sci.12 722.], the authors presented the minimax block search strategy for locating the maximum of unimodal functions of one variable by a sequence of simultaneous function evaluations. In the present work the nearly optimal minimax golden block search method is developed which has the advantage that the number of function evaluations need not be specified in advance. For one experiment per block it reduces to the well known golden section method. It is shown that this method is an excellent approximation of the block search strategy and that for a certain marginal resolution the two methods become identical.

## 6. Games with Incomplete Information Played by “Bayesian” Players Part II. Bayesian Equilibrium Points
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
Part I of this paper has described a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information. It has been shown that, if the various players' subjective probability distributions satisfy a certain mutual-consistency requirement, then any given game with incomplete information will be equivalent to a certain game with complete information, called the “Bayes-equivalent” of the original game, or briefly a “Bayesian game.”

## 7. Utility Theory
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1968
### Abstract:
Utility theory is interested in people's preferences or values and with assumptions about a person's preferences that enable them to be represented in numerically useful ways. The first two sections of this paper say more about what utility is, why people are interested in it, and how it is interpreted and used in the management and behavioral sciences. The third section summarizes a number of utility theories: it may be used either as a concluding overview of the range and variety of utility theories or as a bridge to the final sections. The final eight sections comprise a semi-technical survey of particular theories for readers interested in greater depth.
