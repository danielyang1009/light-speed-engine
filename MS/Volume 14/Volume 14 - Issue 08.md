### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
A goal programming model for selecting media is presented which alters the objective and extends previous media models by accounting for cumulative duplicating audiences over a variety of time periods. This permits detailed control of the distribution of message frequencies directed at each of numerous marketing targets over a sequence of interrelated periods. This is accomplished via a new logarithmic non-reach device and a continuous lognormal generation of the discrete message frequencies.

### Published:

### Abstract:
An illustrative example is developed from an actual application of goal programming to media planning over a period of time. These goals involve distributions of frequencies by demographic and other characteristics as well as budget and other constraining limitations.

## 4. Test Marketing: A Perturbation in the Market Place
### Author(s):
- Benjamin Lipstein
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
New products achieve positions in the market place by disrupting existing brand loyalty and switching patterns. Test markets can be viewed as going through phases of equilibrium prior to new product introduction, disequilibrium during introduction and return to equilibrium. This process is described by transition matrices of brand loyalty and brand switching. A method of analysis is developed which provides indices of the market's stability prior to new product entry, disequilibrium created by the introduction and the market's return to stability. This enables marketing management to judge the impact of introduction as well as evaluate test market results in approximately half the length of time normally required by conventional methods.

## 5. Job-Shop Lot Release Sizes
### Author(s):
- George Schussel
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
A new model (ELRS) for determining optimal job-shop lot sizes is presented. Since the setting of the lot release size is one of the most important controlling parameters in the scheduling of a job-shop, the improvement in technique described in the article should result in substantial savings to job-shop operation costs. In those cases where management is already using an EOQ method for determining lot release sizes, the input data and system required for the implementation of ELRS is basically similar and therefore the new and improved analysis can be substituted at relatively minor inconvenience to the user. For those job-shops which set lot release sizes by informal means, the ELRS concept may provide enough of an improved technique to induce this use of this analysis.

## 6. The Management of Scientific Manpower
### Author(s):
- Borje O. Saxberg
- John W. Slocum, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
Management control of professional employees such as engineers and scientists leads to a state of conflict in the business organization. To management, the control of human resources implies the limiting of individualistic behavior of subordinates in order to realize the objectives of the firm. In contrast, the industrial scientist, even as a subordinate in an organizational hierarchy, believes that control as applied to him should allow for autonomy and independence as attributes of professionalism in his work environment.

## 7. A New Product Analysis and Decision Model
### Author(s):
- Glen L. Urban
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
The decision to add, or to reject, or to investigate more fully a new product proposal is one of the most important problems faced by businessmen. The factors surrounding the decision can be mathematically considered by four sub-models in the areas of demand, cost, profit, and uncertainty. The demand model is structured to consider life cycle, industry, competitive and product interdependency effects, and will admit non-linear and discontinuous functions. A cost minimization model is joined to the demand model to formulate a constrained profit maximization problem. The optimization is accomplished by the use of dynamic programming. The final decision is based on the businessman's criterion in combining uncertainty and the rate of return on investment. A practical application of the model is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and problems of a quantitative approach to new product decisions.

## 9. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
The number of on-line computer applications that exist today gives ample testimony that the computer hardware business has come of age. About fifteen years ago, IBM built the SAGE system which, for the first time, tied computers together with a number of other components. A large central processor communicated with a number of peripheral processors that controlled radar units. Every component had to be specially designed and built at no small cost. Today, the components of a similar system would be standard, with a computer, the interfaces, and the teleprocessing all catalog items.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1968
### Abstract:
—“The question-asking machine” The research director of a Mid-western ad agency once told me that the trouble with operations researchers was that they only made answer machines. He insisted that there was no significant value to him to get answers. Instead, he said, what he needed was a good question asking machine.
