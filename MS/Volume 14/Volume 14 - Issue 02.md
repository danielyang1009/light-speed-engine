## 1. Blast Furnace Production Planning—A Linear Programming Example
### Author(s):
- Tibor Fabian
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
A description of the blast furnace production process is presented and the thermochemical metallurigcal process is expressed as a set of constraints of a linear programming problem. The solution indicates a minimum cost selection of input materials in a production planning context. The material presented here is dedicated to those who are engaged in the mathematical modelling of chemical and other complex processes for purposes of management control. It is also hoped that by adding the paper to the literature of detailed examples, a case study, often desired for classroom instruction, will be provided to educators.

## 2. Optimization of Experimental Lunar Payloads
### Author(s):
- Edwin M. Bartee
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
The scientific exploration of the moon requires that a number of experiments be conducted for the purpose of investigating the many questions and hypotheses posed by nearly every discipline in the scientific community. The broad interest in this effort, the limitations of time and resources for conducting the program, and the complex engineering constraints imposed by the logistics system justify the development of an effective method of making optimum selection of experiments according to the most meaningful criteria. The developed method provides a determination of alternate optimum solutions from which scientific authority may choose. Basic lunar scientific objectives, as determined by NASA interdisciplinary panels, serve as inputs to the system. The relative worth of each objective according to scientific merit is determined by a stratified, intradisciplinary sample of the scientific community using a modified majority-rule technique. The experiments are then ordered according to their contribution to the ordered objectives. A subjective programming method provides alternate payload choices that optimize the scientific merit of the experiments within the engineering constraints of a lunar IMjdoad. An example is presented that simulates the use of an algorithm for sdecting an optimum experiment pajdoad.

## 3. Systems Analysis in Government Operations
### Author(s):
- Guy Black
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
Non-defense Federal government departments and agencies are in the second year of program development and budgetary review in the context of a program packaging structure, in which activities with related objectives are grouped in common packages for analytical and budgetary purposes. One advantage in this approach is that activities can then be cost-benefit traded relative to a simplified objective structure. Where activities are complex and interrelated, it is particularly useful to develop a system concept as the framework for analysis.

## 4. Line Balancing-Sequencing for Mixed-Model Assembly
### Author(s):
- Nick T. Thomopoulos
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
Mixed-model assembly occurs when more than one model of the same general product are intermixed on one assembly line. The amount of work required to assemble units can vary from model to model, creating an uneven flow of work along the line. This paper describes a procedure of adapting single-model line balancing techniques to mixed-model schedules. The paper also introduces a sequencing procedure for determining the order in which models are to flow down the line. Because the line balancing and sequencing procedures consider a wide variety of factors, they are applicable to many types of assembly lines.

## 5. Managerial Perceptions of Organizational Effectiveness
### Author(s):
- Thomas A. Mahoney
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
Perceptions and judgments of 84 managers were analyzed in the development of models of organisational effectiveness applied in managerial judgments. Managers described 283 subordinate organization units in terms of 114 variables often mentioned as indicative of organizational effectiveness. Managers also made judgments of the overall effectiveness of these organizations. Analysis of the descriptions indicated that the 114 variables reflect 24 basic dimensions of organizational effectiveness. Models predictive of managerial judgments of organizational effectiveness were developed using these 24 dimensions. A general model accounted for 56 per cent of the variance of judgments of overall effectiveness made by the 84 managers. Other models developed for more homogeneous sub-samples of managers accounted for 75 to 85 per cent of the variance in judgments of overall effectiveness. These models typically involve only seven of the 24 dimensions of organizational effectiveness with a single dimension carrying the most weight in judgments. These models of managerial judgments of organisational effectiveness identify the basic dimensions viewed by managers in judging subordinate organizations and the relative weights assigned them. As such, they provide a useful framework for the development of criteria for judging organizations for administrative and research applications.

## 6. Verification of Computer Simulation Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
The problem of validating computer simulation models of industrial systems has received only limited attention in the management science literature. The purpose of this paper is to consider the problem of validating computer models in the light of contemporary thought in the fields of philosophy of science, economic theory, and statistics. In order to achieve this goal we have attempted to gather together and present some of the ideas of scientific philosophers, economists, statisticians, and practitioners in the field of simulation which are relevant to the problem of verifying simulation models. We have paid particular attention to the writings of economists who have been concerned with testing the validity of economic models. Among the questions which we shall consider are included: What does it mean to verify a computer model of an industrial system? Are there any differences between the verification of computer models and the verification of other types of models? If so, what are some of these differences? Also considered are a number of measures and techniques for testing the “goodness of fit” of time series generated by computer models to observed historical series.

## 10. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1967
### Abstract:
Languages are important in any discussion of information systems. It is through the medium of a machine-oriented (as opposed to natural) language that the user must communicate with the computer. In order to use the earliest computers, it was necessary to describe the problem in the detailed computer hardware language. Then higher level languages were evolved so that instead of describing a solution in machine language, it was possible to describe it in a more “natural” language. These languages (FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.) are general in the sense that it is possible to solve almost any problem that is solvable in machine language using them.
