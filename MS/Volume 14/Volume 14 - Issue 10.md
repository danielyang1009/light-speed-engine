## 2. Capacity Expansion for India's Nitrogenous Fertilizer Industry
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
- Alan S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1968
### Abstract:
A massive investment program is under way to meet the increased demand for chemical fertilizers in India. This paper reports on a preinvestment survey of that program. Such a survey cannot be viewed as a master plan for the development of the entire chemical fertilizers industry. Rather, it is intended to provide a rough framework within which to draw up a detailed proposal on the next few units to be built. The conculsions are intended to serve as the initial premises for a specific project: when, where, and how large a plant to construct. Necessarily, a preinvestment survey will contain fewer engineering details and will be less realistic than a report on a specific unit.

## 3. Optimal Capacities of Production Facilities

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general cost model and the methods of solution for determining the optimum combination of capacities of the production facilities of a steady-state production system. The model is applied to the practical problem of finding the optimum combination of capacities of the production facilities of an oxygen production and inventory system. Because the cost equations involved are quite complex, the objective function of the formulated model is a very complex non-linear function of two decision variables: the oxygen production rate and the oxygen storage pressure. A computerized gradient method is used to find the optimum values of the two decision variables using parameter values that have been determined empirically. The paper finally studies the effect of variations in some of the parameter values on the optimum values of the decision variables.

## 4. Flexible Pricing of Computer Services
### Author(s):
- Seymour Smidt
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1968
### Abstract:
This article proposes using a flexible price system to allocate computer time and to determine charges for computer users. The proposal is presented in the context of a central university computing center (UCC) although it may be applicable, with some modifications, to a wide range of queueing problems.

## 5. The Dynamic Synthesis Theory of Motivation
### Author(s):
- Bruce Gunn
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1968
### Abstract:
An interdisciplinary perspective of employee motivation is presented, based on the premise that the principles of natural science provide the fundamental basis for analogizing the operational similarities of physical and social productive systems. This concept is applied to motivation by observing that all productive systems—whether physical, organic or social—are input-output systems. The lowest common denominators in these systems are energy and mass. Le Chatelier's principle provides the universal environment for motivation. Thus, the transformation of energy in a given productive system represents the essence of motivation.

## 8. Information in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1968
### Abstract:
Within the past two years a number of services have been offered that make a large central computer available on a time shared basis to anyone who has a terminal. In general these services provide the user with at least one language (usually FORTRAN) that is especially tailored to on-line communications. The following letter describes an application that was programmed in FORTRAN using one of these services.
