## 2. Management Misinformation Systems
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
Five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information systems are identified. It is argued that these are not justified in many (if not most) cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems. These assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managers operate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs the information he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decision milking will improve, (4) better communication between managers improves organizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understand how his information system works, only how to use it. To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system. A procedure for designing such a system is proposed and an example is given of the type of control system which it produces.

## 3. Intuition and Relevance
### Author(s):
- William T. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
The problem of the relevance of the analytical products of management science for the manager whose decision making is largely intuitive is discussed. A definition of intuitive behavior is proposed based on the willingness of the manager to use a particular verbalization of his decision process as a basis for delegating the decision to a particular recipient. The possibility of involving the manager in a series of experiments aimed at enhancing this willingness to delegate is suggested. Effective intuitive behavior is taken to be characteristic of both experienced managers and experienced scientists. Some hypotheses concerning the process of developing the intuitive abilities of inexperienced persons are raised.

## 4. Linear Progamming Models for Water Pollution Control
### Author(s):
- Daniel P. Loucks
- Charles S. Revelle
- Walter R. Lynn
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
Two linear programming models are presented for determining the amount of wastewater treatment required to achieve at minimum cost any particular set of stream dissolved oxygen standards within a river basin. Derived from the generalized Streeter-Phelps differential equations used to describe the rates of dissolved oxygen depletion and recovery of streams, these models are adaptable to any river basin configuration. They can be used not only in determining system costs for various quality standards but also for measuring the cost sensitivity to changes in the design stream and wastewater flows and treatment facility location. An example illustrates the use of these models.

## 5. Heuristic Scheduling in a Woolen Mill
### Author(s):
- E. Gerald Hurst, Jr.
- Aidan B. McNamara
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
The scheduling procedure of a particular production planner in a woolen mill is investigated. A model is developed which attempts to describe the planner's average behavior. Schedules are generated by this model and are compared with the corresponding schedules of the planner. Discrepancies between the planner's and the model's schedules are interpreted with respect to both the adequacy of the model and the consistency of the planner. Suggestions are made for application of the technique to real-time scheduling.

## 6. A Model for Production-Distribution Networks with Transit Billing
### Author(s):
- Carl F. Meyer
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
The model presented in this paper uses the method of linear programming to solve multi-plant, multi-product distribution networks constrained by plant production schedules and manufacturing combinations when the shipment of final goods is a function of the raw material input. This function connecting inbound material with outbound finished goods at a given production facility is described by the privilege of mill-in-transit granted by the material haulers. The model is developed under very general assumptions, and is able to solve the networks in terms of optimally applying transit billing, determining production schedules and combinations, and final distribution of product to customer while allowing for outside purchases of the same end products.

## 7. Inventory Management for Minimum Cost
### Author(s):
- David P. Herron
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
One of the most popular types of inveatoiy management is the (Q, r) system, in which a quantity Q of an item is reordered whenever the inventory position reaches the reorder point r. A number of packaged computer programs are available for this system. However, these programs seldom give the minimum-cost values of Q and r, since they usually employ the Wilson Economic Order Quantity. Use of the Wilson EOQ may result in substantial excess costs, particularly for items of high annual cash flow. This article describes graphical and algebraic methods suitable for computer application to determine accurately the minimum-cost values of Q and r, employing either dollar stockout penalties or specified service levels. Both the single-item and aggregate inventory cases are included. The methods described can readily be implied on most computers and can result in significant cost savings.

## 8. Ranking Procedures and Subjective Probability Distributions
### Author(s):
- Lee H. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
For the most part, modern management has become gradually conditioned to techniques involving the use of subjective probability distributions. In spite of this conditioning, there remain a few who are still somewhat skeptical with regard to the use of such distributions. However, in many instances principal objections are leveled, not toward subjectivity per se, but, rather, toward “nebulous subjectivity.” Many managers still associate an air of mysticism with the development of subjective probability distributions. This is not surprising in view of the facts that (1) relatively little material in pertinent literature is devoted to discussions of methods for deriving subjective distributions, and (2) a large percentage of those discussions which do appear can best be characterized as hand-waving approaches.

## 9. Critique of: “Ranking Procedures and Subjective Probability Distributions”
### Author(s):
- Paul E. Green
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
Lee Smith's paper (Smith, L. H. 1967. Ranking procedures and subjective probability distributions. Management Sci.14 (4, December) B-236–B-249.) is interesting as much for the questions he raises as for the answer he proposes. Those of us who have tried to elicit subjective probability distributions in the context of corporate systems can sympathize with his position that no “objective” way has yet been proposed. It is no wonder that the procedures which he cites as precursors to his proposal are ad hoc and, shall we say, “flexible.” The main issue, however, is whether the procedure advocated in his paper overcomes the limitations of previous devices. Related questions concern: (a) the compatability of probabilistic thinking with the culture of line management; and (b) the accuracy of the elicited judgments, using the “best” of methods.

## 10. Critique of: “Ranking Procedures and Subjective Probability Distributions”
### Author(s):
- Donald G. Morrison
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
Professor Smith's article “Ranking Procedures and Subjective Probability Distribution” (Smith, L. H. 1967. Ranking procedures and subjective probability distributions. Management Sci.14 (4, December) B-236–B-249.) is a worthwhile attempt at making the Bayesian decision theory concepts more operational; however, he has fallen far short of this objective. The example he chose (obtaining a subjective probability distribution on market share) is in many ways inappropriate for Smith's technique, and although his procedure is more “mathematical” than some existing methods, it is not as relevant. There are some relatively minor points in Smith's article on which one might quibble, but there are also enough major, substantive matters that we will direct our critique to these issues.

## 11. Information Systems in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1967
### Abstract:
I hope that the various comments in this month's column will excite the reader's imagination, stimulating him to contribute either to this column or to the Journal. Although the term “information systems” is often equated with computers, there is no need to do this. There were information systems long before there were computers, and information often flows today without the aid of computers, nearly as often in spite of them.
