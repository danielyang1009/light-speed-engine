## 2. Competitive Organizational Structures in Coupled Markets
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
The effect of different company organizational structures (as centralized and decentralized) on competition in coupled markets is studied using a game theory approach. By coupling it is meant that management actions taken in the market for one product have an effect on the market for another. A specific example is where advertising dollars spent in generating sales for one product have an influence on the sales of another product. In some cases competition between companies in coupled markets takes the form of a Prisoner's Dilemma and may be discussed in terms of recent research findings on this game. Various other aspects of research on competitive organizational structures in coupled markets are discussed.

## 3. A Systems Study of Policy Formulation in a Vertically-Integrated Firm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
Vertically-integrated companies often provide unusual opportunities for conflicts among organizational performance measures, especially as the vertical interdependency of product flow interacts with organisational separation of profit objectives. The resulting problems and their potential resolution by policy reformulation are discussed in this paper for the case of a large manufacturer-retailer of perishable food products.

## 4. Implementation of Management Science in Latin America: A Case Study and Generalization
### Author(s):
- N. Paul Loomba
- Efraim Turban
- Alvin Cohen
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
Private and public programs designed for rapid industrialization and for raising living standards have caused a growing demand in Latin America for persons trained in management science. Current sources for such training include special “productivity centers,” departments or institutes of management science at various Latin American universities, technical personnel of North American firms, and professional academicians of North American educational institutions. If the level of private business between North and South America increases, it would be quite reasonable for North American firms to assume a greater responsibility for the transfer of management science techniques to Latin America.

## 5. Non-Stocking Criterion
### Author(s):
- R. W. Fenske
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
Contemporary inventory management attempts to make two critical inventory decisions—the order quantity and the order point. This type of analysis presupposes that stocking of the item is economically justified. Quite obviously this will not always be the case and inventory managers have had to turn to rules of thumb which are highly inflexible and consequently these rules often suggest exactly the opposite decision from that which should be made.

## 6. A Criterion for Investing in Information
### Author(s):
- Joel Owen
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
As the amount of money invoiced in a decision rises, so does the burden of making the decision. Thus, it is not surprising or rare that the question arises: should a study be instituted before the decision is made to lessen the risks involved? Of course, such a study will itself cost something depending on the cost of analyzing data, the number of people involved and the value of the information gathered. The decision maker is then confronted with two courses of action, to make a decision based on existing information or to institute a study program, i.e., to invest in information before making a decision. In this paper we develop a procedure by which the decision maker can choose between these alternatives.

## 7. The Engineering and Management of an Effective System
### Author(s):
- Donald S. Feigenbaum
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1968
### Abstract:
Five to ten years ago, the systems approach was thought to mean full-scale factory automation or fully computerized information flow. Experience has shown that a more useful concept is of systems as integrated man-machine-information structures which provide economic control over technical and organizational complexity.
