## 1. Demon, Mark II: An Extremal Equation Approach to New Product Marketing

### Published:

### Abstract:
Numerous alternatives are available in the kinds of studies which can be elected in the market research which should precede the introduction of a new product. This gives rise to a possible network interpretation and treatment by an associated chance-constrained programming characterization and analysis. The resulting model, called DEMON (Decision Mapping Via Optimum GO-NO Networks), which was discussed in [Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper, J. K. DeVoe, D. B. Learner. DEMON: Decision mapping via optimum GO-NO networks—A model for marketing new products. Management Sci.12(11) 865–877.], is here given a new formulation in terms of an extremal equation. A general analytic characterization is achieved and then replaced by more special ones. Means for effecting study decisions and inferences are discussed along with the sensitivity analyses that we associate with GO and NO preemptions, relative to profit and payback constraints. Payback (in a constraint) is here distinguished from its use as a criterion for choice (or objective), the latter being here oriented toward MEMP (maximizing expected maximum profit). A chart is provided for interpreting these and other aspects of policy which bear on the problems of marketing a new product.

## 2. The I Days of Christmas: A Model for Competitive Advertising Over An Intensive Campaign
### Author(s):
- Colin E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 May 1968
### Abstract:
During a pre-Christmas campaign in which daily sales are generally increasing, it is important to achieve a proper balance in advertising allocation between the final days of heavy sales and the earlier days of the campaign when sales are lighter but advertising might affect sales farther into the future. This paper presents a model of such a problem for two competing firms, an algorithm for solution of the model, numerical examples, and a proof of the algorithm.

## 3. An Inverse Warehousing Problem for Imperfect Markets
### Author(s):
- Duean Bell
### Published:
- 1 May 1968
### Abstract:
This paper focuses upon the problem of a monopolist who has no control over the rate of arrivals into inventory and who ships his product to distant markets where the price per unit is a randomly shifting inverse function of the quantity shipped. It is assumed that the firm seeks to minimize its expected losses over a many-period horizon where the quantity shipped during any period is subject to last minute reconsideration.

## 4. Optimal Maintenance Policy and Sale Date of a Machine
### Author(s):
- Gerald L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 May 1968
### Abstract:
A machine is to be bought, used for productive purposes for a length of time, and then sold. It is possible to do preventive maintenance while the machine is being used, if desired, in order to slow down the degradation of the machine's capability. The value of owning the machine is the sum of the discounted value of its production while it is owned plus its discounted value when sold. In this paper a modification of a model due to B. Naslund for the problem is discussed. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, the problem is treated as one of optimal control with the control variables being the use or nonuse of preventive maintenance and the selection of the sale date. It is shown that the optimal maintenance policy is bang-bang, and methods for finding the optimal sale date are determined. Simply examples show the various kinds of solutions that can be obtained with varying assumptions concerning the actual functions used in the model.

## 5. Stochastic Sensitivity Analysis of Maximum Flow and Shortest Route Networks
### Author(s):
- Richard D. Wollmer
### Published:
- 1 May 1968
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm that can be used to solve two types of network sensitivity problems. In the first, arcs are subject to breakdowns that degrade their capacities. It is required, within certain confidence limits, to find the maximum possible effect of n breakdowns on maximum flow. In the second, arcs are subject to improvements that reduce their lengths. It is required, also within certain confidence limits, to find the maximum possible effect n total improvements can have on shortest path length. Capacities resulting from breakdowns and lengths resulting from improvements are random variables specified by their mean values and variances.

## 6. A Treatment of Transportation Problems by Primal Partition Programming
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Grigoriadis
- William F. Walker
### Published:
- 1 May 1968
### Abstract:
J. B. Rosen's Primal Partition Programming method [Rosen, J. B. 1964. Primal partition programming for block diagonal matrices. Numerische Mathematik6.] is applied to the classical transportation problem and to some related generalizations or extensions. Observations on the special structure of the constraint matrix result in a subproblem which may be solved by inspection, a unimodular master inverse of order m and in a considerable reduction in the number of vectors spanning the dual space of the master problem. This inverse and master problem may be replaced by a directed network of at most m(m − 1) arcs and m nodes, where m is the number of sources. Dual feasibility is maintained throughout the optimization procedure. The generalizations and extensions treated are: (i) The upper bounded transportation problem, (ii) the transportation problem in which the source availabilities are subject to some general linear constraints and, (iii) the parametric transportation problem. Programming of the method for a digital computer is quite simple and requires only integer arithmetic (except for (ii)). Computing efficiency compares quite well with the specialization of the Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition method to transportation problems [Williams, A. C. 1962. A treatment of transportation problems by decomposition. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math.10(1, March).] and other methods of solution.
