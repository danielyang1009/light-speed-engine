## 2. Can Trustworthiness in a Supply Chain Be Signaled?

### Published:
- 13 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
The relationship between a buyer and its suppliers often relies on factors beyond the terms of a contractual agreement. Buyers can therefore benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We argue that precontractual actions by a supplier, for example making costly buyer-specific investments without a long-term contract, can signal a supplier’s trustworthiness. We develop a theoretical model to reflect supplier trustworthiness, and determine when a buyer can benefit from identifying trustworthy suppliers. We show that costly relationship-specific investments can serve as a signal of trustworthiness, and that supply chain profits increase when trustworthy suppliers are able to identify themselves in this fashion. We demonstrate the importance of the signaling mechanism using laboratory experiments. The experimental results show that relationship-specific investments lead to more collaborative transactions, with buyers offering higher prices and suppliers returning higher-quality products. This results in increased profits for both buyers and suppliers. Additionally, we design a treatment which shuts down the signaling mechanism and show that the benefits of the buyer-specific investment are no longer present in this case. Finally, we show that the benefits of buyer-specific investments for both suppliers and buyers are strengthened when firms interact repeatedly.

## 3. I Lie? We Lie! Why? Experimental Evidence on a Dishonesty Shift in Groups

### Published:
- 3 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Unethical behavior such as dishonesty, cheating and corruption occurs frequently in organizations or groups. Recent experimental evidence suggests that there is a stronger inclination to behave immorally in groups than individually. We ask if this is the case, and if so, why. Using a parsimonious laboratory setup, we study how individual behavior changes when deciding as a group member. We observe a strong dishonesty shift. This shift is mainly driven by communication within groups and turns out to be independent of whether group members face payoff commonality or not (i.e., whether other group members benefit from one’s lie). Group members come up with and exchange more arguments for being dishonest than for complying with the norm of honesty. Thereby, group membership shifts the perception of the validity of the honesty norm and of its distribution in the population.

## 4. Dispute Resolution or Escalation? The Strategic Gaming of Feedback Withdrawal Options in Online Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Many online markets encourage traders to make good after an unsatisfactory transaction by offering the opportunity to withdraw negative reputational feedback in a dispute resolution phase. Motivated by field evidence and guided by theoretical considerations, we use laboratory markets with two-sided moral hazard to show that this option, contrary to the intended purpose, produces an escalation of dispute. The mutual feedback withdrawal option creates an incentive to leave negative feedback, independent of the opponent’s behavior, to improve one’s bargaining position in the dispute resolution phase. This leads to distorted reputation information and less trust and trustworthiness in the trading phase. Buyers who refuse to give feedback strategically, even when it comes at a personal cost, mitigate the detrimental impact. It is also mitigated in markets with one-sided moral hazard and a unilateral feedback withdrawal option.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Growing evidence shows that biological factors affect individual financial decisions that could be reflected in financial markets. Testosterone, a chemical messenger especially influential in male physiology, has been shown to affect economic decision making and is taken as a performance enhancer among some financial professionals. This is the first experimental study to test how testosterone causally affects trading and prices. We exogenously elevated testosterone in male traders and tested testosterone’s effect both on their trading behavior in experimental asset markets and on the size and duration of asset price bubbles. Using both aggregated and individual trading data, we find that testosterone administration generated larger and longer-lasting bubbles by causing high bids and the slow incorporation of the asset’s fundamental value.

## 6. Coordinated Logistics with a Truck and a Drone
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
We determine the efficiency of a delivery system in which an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides service to customers while making return trips to a truck that is itself moving. In other words, a UAV picks up a package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical simulations on a road network, we demonstrate that the improvement in efficiency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the speeds of the truck and the UAV.

## 7. Firm Expansion, Size Spillovers, and Market Dominance in Retail Chain Dynamics
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
We develop and estimate a dynamic game of strategic firm expansion and contraction decisions to study the role of firm size in future profitability and market dominance. Modeling firm size is important because retail chain dynamics are more richly driven by expansion and contraction than de novo entry or permanent exit. Additionally, anticipated size spillovers may influence the strategies of forward-looking firms, making it difficult to analyze the effects of size without explicitly accounting for these in the expectations and, hence, decisions of firms. Expansion may also be profitable for some firms while detrimental for others. Thus, we explicitly model and allow for heterogeneity in the dynamic link between firm size and profits as well as potential for persistent brand effects through firm-specific unobservable factors. As a methodological contribution, we surmount the hurdle of estimating the model by extending a two-step procedure that circumvents solving the game. The first stage combines semiparametric conditional choice probability estimation with a particle filter to eliminate the serially correlated unobservable components. The second stage uses a forward simulation approach to estimate the payoff parameters. Data on Canadian hamburger chains from their inception in 1970 to 2005 provide evidence of firm-specific heterogeneity in brand effects, size spillovers, and persistence in profitability. This heterogeneous dynamic linkage shows how McDonald’s becomes dominant and other chains falter as they evolve, thus affecting market structure and industry concentration.

## 8. The Effects of Hedge Fund Interventions on Strategic Firm Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We examine the impact of hedge fund interventions on target firms’ strategic behavior, specifically their voluntary disclosure and earnings management strategies. We find a decrease in both the likelihood and the frequency of management earnings forecasts conveying bad news and an increase in the level of real earnings management following interventions by hedge fund activists. Additional evidence suggests that managers substitute between voluntary disclosure and earnings management strategies in resisting hedge fund attacks. We also find that withholding of bad news is more pronounced when hedge fund activists pose greater threats to the target firm’s management and when the intervention lasts for a relatively short time period. Our results are consistent with firms behaving strategically in response to heightened career/reputation concerns and endangered corporate control arising from hedge fund activism.

## 9. Price to Compete … with Many: How to Identify Price Competition in High-Dimensional Space
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We study price competition in markets with a large number (in the magnitude of hundreds or thousands) of potential competitors. We address two methodological challenges: simultaneity bias and high dimensionality. Simultaneity bias arises from joint determination of prices in competitive markets. We propose a new instrumental variable approach to address simultaneity bias in high dimensions. The novelty of the idea is to exploit online search and clickstream data to uncover customer preferences at a granular level, with sufficient variations both over time and across competitors in order to obtain valid instruments at a large scale. We then develop a methodology to identify relevant competitors in high dimensions combining the instrumental variable approach with high-dimensional l − 1 norm regularization. We apply this data-driven approach to study the patterns of hotel price competition in the New York City market. We also show that the competitive responses identified through our method can help hoteliers proactively manage their prices and promotions.

## 10. Unusual News Flow and the Cross Section of Stock Returns
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2017
### Abstract:
We document that stocks that experience sudden increases in idiosyncratic volatility underperform otherwise similar stocks in the future, and we propose that this phenomenon can be explained by the Miller conjecture [Miller E (1977) Risk, uncertainty, and divergence of opinion. J. Finance 32(4):1151–1168]. We show that volatility shocks can be traced to unusual firm-level news flow, which temporarily increases the level of investor disagreement about the firm value. At the same time, volatility shocks pose a barrier to short selling, preventing pessimistic investors from expressing their views. In the presence of divergent opinions and short-selling constraints, prices initially reflect optimistic views but adjust downward in the future as investors’ opinions converge.

### Published:
- 4 May 2017
### Abstract:
We study portfolio choice with multiple stocks and capital gains taxation, assuming that capital losses can only offset current or future realized capital gains. We show, through backtesting using empirical distributions, that optimal equity holdings over an extended period are significantly lower on average than benchmark holdings suggested in the literature. Using value and growth or small and large portfolios, the backtests show that allocations remain persistently underdiversified. Carryover losses have large economic significance since they can dramatically shrink the no-trade region. Finally, the backtested economic cost of incorrectly modeling capital losses is at least 8% of lifetime wealth.

## 12. The Contingent Wisdom of Dyads: When Discussion Enhances vs. Undermines the Accuracy of Collaborative Judgments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We evaluate the effect of discussion on the accuracy of collaborative judgments. In contrast to prior research, we show that discussion can either aid or impede accuracy relative to the averaging of collaborators’ independent judgments, as a systematic function of task type and interaction process. For estimation tasks with a wide range of potential estimates, discussion aided accuracy by helping participants prevent and eliminate egregious errors. For estimation tasks with a naturally bounded range, discussion following independent estimates performed on par with averaging. Importantly, if participants did not first make independent estimates, discussion greatly harmed accuracy by limiting the range of considered estimates, independent of task type. Our research shows that discussion can be a powerful tool for error reduction, but only when appropriately structured: Decision makers should form independent judgments to consider a wide range of possible answers, and then use discussion to eliminate extremely large errors.

## 13. Optimal Contract to Induce Continued Effort
### Author(s):
- Peng Sun
- Feng Tian
### Published:
- 22 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We consider a basic model of a risk-neutral principal incentivizing a risk-neutral agent to exert effort to raise the arrival rate of a Poisson process. The effort is costly to the agent, is unobservable to the principal, and affects the instantaneous arrival rate. Each arrival yields a constant revenue to the principal. The principal, therefore, devises a mechanism involving payments and a potential stopping time to motivate the agent to always exert effort. We formulate this problem as a stochastic optimal control model with an incentive constraint in continuous time over an infinite horizon. Although we allow payments to take general forms contingent on past arrival times, the optimal contract has a simple and intuitive structure, which depends on whether the agent is as patient as or less patient than the principal toward future income.

## 14. Forecasting Corporate Bond Returns with a Large Set of Predictors: An Iterated Combination Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 May 2017
### Abstract:
Using a comprehensive return data set and an array of 27 macroeconomic, stock, and bond predictors, we find that corporate bond returns are highly predictable based on an iterated combination model. The large set of predictors outperforms traditional predictors substantially, and predictability generated by the iterated combination is both statistically and economically significant. Stock market and macroeconomic variables play an important role in forming expected bond returns. Return forecasts are closely linked to the evolution of real economy. Corporate bond premia have strong predictive power for business cycle, and the primary source of this predictive power is from the low-grade bond premium.

## 15. Explaining Momentum and Value Simultaneously
### Author(s):
- Jun Li
### Published:
- 9 May 2017
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a unified risk-based explanation for momentum profits and the value premium in a neoclassical investment-based model. Winner firms have higher short-term productivity and hence more negative exposures to the price of investment goods than loser firms as a result of greater investment plans. Value firms have lower long-term productivity and higher operating leverage and hence higher sensitivities to neutral productivity shocks than growth firms. The model reproduces the coexistence of momentum profits and the value premium, the failure of the unconditional capital asset pricing model, the predictability of momentum profits by market states, and the long-term reversal of momentum profits. Empirical tests confirm a negative price of risk for the shock to the relative price of investment goods.

## 16. Profit Sharing and Peer Reporting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
Despite the “1/N problem” associated with profit sharing, the empirical literature finds that sharing profits with workers has a positive impact on work team and firm performance. We examine one possible resolution to this puzzle by observing that, although the incentive to work harder under profit sharing is weak, it might be sufficient to motivate workers to report each other for shirking, especially if the workers are reciprocally minded. Our model provides the rationale for this conjecture, and we discuss the results of an experiment finding that workers who share in firm profits are more willing to provide accurate information about their peers to management and that profit sharing is most effective when peer reporting is possible.

## 17. Management of Reported and Forecast EPS, Investor Responses, and Research Implications
### Author(s):

- Jacob Thomas
### Published:
- 31 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We document substantial management of reported and forecast earnings per share (EPS) for analyst-followed U.S. firms, with the extent of management increasing with share price. Managers smooth the volatility of reported EPS by using accruals to offset cash flow shocks. Smoother EPS is easier to forecast, resulting in smaller forecast errors. Managers also differentially guide forecasts to improve accuracy. Whereas unmanaged forecast errors are much larger for high-price firms, they are compressed to the point their magnitudes resemble those for low-price firms. Managers also guide analyst forecasts to generate patterns of forecast walkdowns that again vary with share price. Given the remarkable level of management implied by our results, we conduct additional robustness analyses. The strongest evidence is observed in stock price responses: investors recognize efforts to manage reported and forecast EPS and adjust accordingly. We highlight potential biases caused by researchers being unaware of managerial efforts and investor responses, and offer ways to mitigate those biases.

## 18. Reference-Dependent Utility, Product Variety, and Price Competition
### Author(s):
- Wilfred Amaldoss

### Published:
- 23 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Products such as Nike running shoes, Gillette razors, and Gatorade sports drink serve as the standard against which consumers evaluate other members of the category. Empirical evidence suggests that consumers care about not only the consumption utility derived from a product, but also the gain–loss utility in comparison to the reference product of the category. This paper examines how reference-dependent utility affects price competition in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers’ tastes are diverse. When consumer valuations are low, the reference product is priced lower than a nonreference product. In contrast, when consumer valuations are high, the reference product is priced higher than a nonreference product. Moreover, loss aversion on the price dimension always intensifies competition among low-valuation goods, whereas loss aversion on the taste dimension softens competition among high-valuation goods only if consumer sensitivity to the difference in match quality is above a threshold. We also find that an increase in the diversity of consumers’ tastes reduces equilibrium profits if consumer valuation is low but has the opposite effect if consumer valuation is high. We further explore how an increase in the popularity of the reference product affects price competition. Finally, we assess the robustness of the findings by extending the model in different directions.

## 19. Speculative Equilibrium with Differences in Higher-Order Beliefs
### Author(s):
- Jungsuk Han
- Albert S. Kyle
### Published:
- 29 May 2017
### Abstract:
Modest differences in higher-order beliefs may have large price effects. We generalize a standard rational expectations equilibrium model with different information by allowing differences in higher-order beliefs. Investors have possibly different dogmatic beliefs about the mean, different dogmatic beliefs about other investors’ beliefs, and so on for higher and higher orders of beliefs. Even when every investor’s first-order expectations are unbiased, overvaluation results when investors have inconsistent higher-order beliefs that their own expectations are more optimistic than average. This lack of common knowledge destabilizes prices in an unbounded manner as market liquidity disappears.

## 20. A Reinterpretation of the Optimal Demand for Risky Assets in Fund Separation Theorems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
In a continuous-time portfolio selection model with N risky assets and K state variables driving their risk and return parameters, we derive simple expressions for the allocation to each asset in the K + 1 risky funds of the (K + 2)-fund separation theorem. We show that the allocation to any given risky asset in each fund can be written in terms of the parameters of a regression of the excess returns of this asset on those of the N − 1 remaining assets. We also use these parameters to provide quantitative measures of the increase in Sharpe ratio of the speculative demand, or in the maximum correlation of each hedging demand with respect to the corresponding risk factor, associated with the introduction of a new asset in the investment universe. Finally, we show that in a multiperiod setting, an asset is “spanned” by others if and only if it improves neither the maximum Sharpe ratio of the speculative demand nor the maximum correlations of the hedging demands with the risk factors.

## 21. Microgeography and the Direction of Inventive Activity
### Author(s):
- Christian Catalini
### Published:
- 19 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
I provide novel empirical evidence grounded in an original theoretical framework to explain why colocation matters for the rate, direction, and quality of scientific collaboration. To address endogeneity concerns due to selection into colocation and matching, I exploit the constraints imposed on the spatial allocation of labs on the Jussieu campus of Paris by the removal of asbestos from its buildings. Consistent with search costs constituting a major friction to collaboration, colocation increases the likelihood of joint research by 3.5 times, an effect that is mostly driven by lab pairs that face higher search costs ex ante. Furthermore, separation does not negatively affect collaboration between previously colocated labs. However, while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones embark on less correlated research trajectories. Research outcomes, instead, seem to be mostly influenced by how distance affects execution costs: after colocation, labs are more likely to pursue both lower-quality projects (a selection effect) and high-quality projects (an effort effect). Opposite effects on quality are observed after separation. Whereas search costs affect which scientists are likely to collaborate together, execution costs shape the quality of their output.

## 22. Gift Exchange in the Workplace: Addressing the Conflicting Evidence with a Careful Test
### Author(s):
- Constança Esteves-Sorenson
### Published:
- 21 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Tests of gift exchange, wherein agents receive excess wages which are noncontingent on performance in one-shot settings, have yielded contradictory evidence: they sometimes find effort boosts, consistent with gift exchange, whereas they sometimes find no effort increases, consistent with a standard model. We identify eight confounds that could have led to the mixed evidence—agent disutility from being viewed as selfish, small samples, insufficient wage raises, an effort ceiling, fatigue, selection of abler workers, reemployment concerns, and peer effects—and run a comprehensive test addressing them. Our test consisted of a field experiment hiring workers for a data entry job, followed by laboratory games assessing their prosocial behavior. After addressing these confounds, we find that behavior during the field test was consistent with a standard model: workers did not repay fixed wage raises with an effort boost, but they did raise effort in response to a piece rate. The piece-rate scheme was also more efficient: the effort boost came at lower expense than paying fixed wage raises. Further, workers who behaved prosocially in laboratory games did not behave prosocially in the field.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented by managers. Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors’ queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the trade-offs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated.

## 24. Managerial Incentives to Increase Risk Provided by Debt, Stock, and Options
### Author(s):
- Joshua D. Anderson
- John E. Core
### Published:
- 6 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We measure a manager’s risk-taking incentives as the total sensitivity of the manager’s debt, stock, and option holdings to firm volatility. We compare this measure with the option vega and with the relative measures used by the prior literature. Vega does not capture risk-taking incentives from managers’ stock and debt holdings and does not reflect the fact that employee options are warrants. The relative measures do not incorporate the sensitivity of options to volatility. Our new measure explains risk choices better than vega and the relative measures and should be useful for future research on managers’ risk choices.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We study how misaligned language between the investor and the firm contributes to the underweighting of foreign securities in an international portfolio. In particular, we document a significant U.S. institutional investor bias against firms located in Quebec relative to firms located in the rest of Canada (ROC). The differential bias is surprising given that (i) Quebec and the other Canadian provinces share the same nationality, federal law, stock exchange, and accounting standards; (ii) their regulatory filings are prepared in English and French; and (iii) U.S. institutional investors are sophisticated and located close to Quebec and the ROC. We also examine Quebec firms with different levels of French versus English online presences as well as those with CEOs who have U.S. work experience or board members or financial analysts who reside in the United States. We find that each factor affects the relative underweighting of investment in Quebec versus the ROC. Finally, we contrast the holdings of institutional investors located in the United Kingdom and France to bolster our conclusion that incongruent languages contribute to the underweighting of Quebec firms relative to firms in the ROC.

## 26. Lower Price or Higher Reward? Measuring the Effect of Consumers’ Preferences on Reward Programs
### Author(s):
- Federico Rossi
### Published:
- 26 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
Despite criticisms regarding their effectiveness, reward programs today represent a prevalent and apparently successful form of marketing investment for several industries such as airlines, hotels, gas stations, and credit cards. To understand what might contribute to their success, this paper investigates the purchase behavior of consumers who participate in a reward program from the travel industry. We estimate a dynamic demand model of gasoline purchase, and compare the value that consumers attach to rewards with the value they attach to the money spent for gasoline. We find that there exists a significant portion of frequent travelers who extract more value from one dollar’s worth of rewards than from one dollar spent for gasoline. Most of the effectiveness of the reward program is due to the behavior of these consumers. Their insensitivity to price induces firms to increase fuel prices by 1 euro cent per liter, which corresponds to about 10% increase in their margins. The program also contributes to softening competition, increasing margins by 4%.
