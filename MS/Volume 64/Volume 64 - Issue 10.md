### Abstract:
In war zones and economically deprived regions, because of extreme resource restrictions, a single provider may be the sole person in charge of providing emergency care to a group of patients. An important question the provider faces under such circumstances is whether or not to perform triage and how to prioritize the patients. By choosing to triage a particular patient, the provider can determine the health condition and thus the urgency of the patient, but that will come at the expense of delaying the actual service (stabilization or initial treatment) for that patient as well as all the other patients. Motivated by this problem, which also arises in other service contexts, we consider a service system where finitely many patients, all available at time zero, belong to one of the two possible triage classes, where each class is characterized by its waiting cost and expected service time. Patients’ class identities are initially unknown, but the service provider has the option to spend time on triage to determine the class of a patient. Our objective is to identify policies that balance the time spent on triage with the time spent on service by minimizing the total expected cost. We provide a complete characterization of the optimal dynamic policy and show that the optimal dynamic policy that specifies when to perform triage is determined by a switching curve, and we provide a mathematical expression for this curve. One insight that comes out of this characterization is that the server should start with performing triage when there are sufficiently many patients and never perform triage when there are few patients. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which we demonstrate how one can use our mathematical results to develop policies that can be used in mass-casualty triage and prioritization, and we find that there are substantial benefits to using one of these policies instead of the simpler benchmarks.

## 3. Catastrophe Aversion and Risk Equity in an Interdependent World

### Published:
- 13 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
Catastrophe aversion and risk equity are important concepts both in risk management theory and practice. Keeney [Keeney RL (1980) Equity and public risk. Oper. Res. 28(3):527–534] was the first to formally define these concepts. He demonstrated that the two concepts are always in conflict. Yet his result is based on the assumption that individual risks are independent. It has therefore limited relevance for real-world catastrophic events. We extend Keeney’s result to dependent risks and derive the conditions under which more equity and more correlation between two risks imply a more catastrophic situation. We then generalize some of the results for multiple correlated risks.

## 4. Death, Bereavement, and Creativity

### Published:
- 16 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Does creativity, on average, increase or decrease during bereavement? Dates of death of relatives and close friends of 33 French artists and 15 American artists were gathered from electronic sources and biographies, and information on over 15,000 paintings was collected from the Blouin Art Sales Index and the online collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Musée d’Orsay, including more than 12,000 observations on price. An event study indicates that there is no evidence that the death of a friend or relative makes an artist more creative, and there is some evidence that prices of paintings are significantly lower during the first year following the year of death of a friend or relative. Furthermore, paintings that were created during this bereavement period are less likely to be included in a major museum’s collection.

### Abstract:
A growing body of correlational studies suggests that sex hormones such as those contained in, or affected by, oral contraceptives (OCs) may impact economic behavior. However, despite widespread use of OCs among women in Western countries, little is known about their potential behavioral effects. The present study investigates whether OCs causally influence economic preferences. We randomly allocate 340 women aged 18–35 to three months of a widely used OC or placebo treatment. At the end of treatment, we conduct an economic experiment measuring altruism, financial risk taking, and willingness to compete. The statistical power is 80% to detect an effect size equal to a Cohen’s d of 0.30 at the 5% level. We find no significant effects of OCs on any of the measured preferences, indicating that this widely used OC treatment, commonly used throughout the world, does not significantly affect the measured economic preferences. Further, we find no relation between menstrual cycle phase and economic preferences in the placebo group.

## 6. Strategy and the Strategist: How It Matters Who Develops the Strategy
### Author(s):
- Eric Van den Steen
### Published:
- 25 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
This paper addresses primarily two questions. First, when (and why) should a company’s strategy be developed by its CEO versus by some outside analyst or other insider? Second, how does strategy interact with vision (in the sense of a strong belief about the right course of action)? The paper studies these questions using a functional definition of strategy as “the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other choices.” Among other things, the paper shows that strategy formulation by the CEO leads to both better strategy and better execution, and that a strategist’s vision may improve execution. In the process, the paper also identifies criteria that make a decision strategic and derives explanations why strategies often reflect the background of the strategist.

## 7. Incentives and Ratcheting in a Multiproduct Firm: A Field Experiment
### Author(s):
- Francisco Brahm
- Joaquin Poblete
### Published:
- 8 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
We develop a model and derive behavioral predictions for a multiproduct sales force subject to goals set based on past performance. We test these predictions using a field experiment in which 53 salespersons from a Chilean beverage company face exogenous variations in monthly sales goals. Confirming our predictions, we found that (1) absent strategic considerations—no goal ratcheting—salespersons increase (decrease) sales in the product category for which the return to effort increases (decreases), (2) including strategic considerations behavior reverses: salespersons who expect high goal ratcheting decrease (increase) sales in the category for which the return to effort increases (decreases), (3) sales did not change for the average salespersons, reflecting heterogeneity in the expectations of goal ratcheting rather than unresponsiveness to incentives. Our study points at the importance of the dynamics of incentive design, in particular, the importance of understanding the dynamics of goal setting in firms.

## 8. Dynamic Pricing Under Debt: Spiraling Distortions and Efficiency Losses
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
Firms often finance their inventory through debt and subsequently sell it to generate profits and service the debt. Pricing of products is consequently driven by inventory and debt servicing considerations. We show that limited liability under debt induces sellers to charge higher prices and to discount products at a slower pace. We find that these distortions result in revenue losses that compound over time, leading to some form of performance spiral down. We quantify the extent to which these inefficiencies can be mitigated by practical debt contract terms that emerge as natural remedies from our analysis, and find debt amortization or financial covenants to be the most effective, followed by debt relief and early repayment options.

### Published:
- 2 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Mobile-promotion platforms enable advertisers (individual users or businesses) to directly launch their personalized mobile advertising campaigns. These platforms contract with advertisers to provide a certain number of impressions on mobile apps in their desired sets of geographic locations (usually cities or zip codes) within their desired time durations (for example, a month); the execution of each such a contract is referred to as a campaign. To fulfill the demands of the campaigns, the platform bids in real time at an ad exchange to win mobile impressions arising over the desired sets of locations of the campaigns and then allocates the acquired impressions among the ongoing campaigns. The core features that characterize this procurement problem—supply is uncertain, supply cannot be inventoried, and there are demand-side commitments to be met—are applicable to a variety of other business settings as well. Our analysis in this paper offers near-optimal policies for both a static model and a dynamic model of campaign arrivals. The static model represents a subscription-based setting, where customers provide information of their campaigns in advance to the platform. The dynamic model represents a setting where campaigns arrive randomly and the platform reacts to these arrivals in real time; for this model, our rolling-horizon policy periodically recomputes the platform’s procurement (or bidding) and allocation decisions. We establish performance bounds on our policies for both models and demonstrate the attractiveness of these bounds on real data. By isolating important structural features of a given set of campaigns, we discuss practical implementation issues and offer procurement-policy recommendations for a variety of settings based on these features.

## 10. User-Generated Content and Competing Firms’ Product Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Firms employ various techniques to obtain information about consumer taste/location and valuation prior to making product design decisions. User-generated content has become an important information source. The vast variety and volume of user-generated content makes firms better informed about consumers (precision-improving effect), and the common and public nature of user-generated content makes firms’ information more correlated (correlation-increasing effect). We examine the impact of user-generated content in a setting in which two competing firms that are uncertain about consumer location or valuation design and sell horizontally differentiated products. We find that user-generated content has very different implications for competing firms’ location decisions and quality decisions. When firms are uncertain about consumer taste and choose their product locations, whether firms and/or consumers benefit from the user-generated content depends on which of the two effects dominates. We find that only when the correlation-increasing effect is moderate, a win–win scenario for both firms and consumers occurs, but the society always benefits from user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference strengthens the overall impact of user-generated content. In sharp contrast, when firms face uncertain consumer valuation of quality and choose product quality, they do not benefit from user-generated content, but consumers may benefit or lose from it. When the correlation-increasing effect is significant, both firms and consumers, and therefore the society, are hurt by user-generated content. Stronger consumer preference mitigates the negative impact but amplifies the positive impact of user-generated content in this case.

## 11. The Value of Multidimensional Rating Systems: Evidence from a Natural Experiment and Randomized Experiments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Online product ratings offer information on product quality. Scholars have recently proposed the potential of designing multidimensional rating systems to better convey information on multiple dimensions of products. This study investigates whether and how multidimensional rating systems affect consumer satisfaction (measured by product ratings), based on both observational data and two randomized experiments. Our identification strategy of the observational study hinges on a natural experiment on TripAdvisor when the website started to allow consumers to rate multiple dimensions of the restaurants, as opposed to only providing an overall rating, in January 2009. We further obtain rating data on the same set of restaurants from Yelp, which controls for the unobserved restaurant quality over time and allows us to identify the causal effect using a difference-in-differences approach. Results from the econometric analyses show that ratings in a single-dimensional rating system have a downward trend and a higher dispersion, whereas ratings in a multidimensional rating system are significantly higher and convergent. Findings from two randomized experiments suggest that the multidimensional rating system helps consumers find products that better fit their preferences and increases the confidence of their choices. We also show that the observed results cannot be explained by the priming effect due to rating system interface or a list of other alternative explanations. The combined evidence from the natural experiment and randomized experiments support the view that the multidimensional rating system enhances rating informativeness and provide implications for designing online rating systems that help consumers match their preferences with product attributes.

## 12. Privacy Protection, Personalized Medicine, and Genetic Testing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
This paper explores how state genetic privacy laws affect the diffusion of personalized medicine, using data on genetic testing for cancer risks. State genetic privacy regimes employ and combine up to three alternative approaches to protecting patient privacy: Rules requiring that an individual is notified about potential privacy risks; rules restricting discriminatory usage of genetic data by employers or insurance companies; and rules limiting redisclosure without the consent of the individual. We find empirically that approaches to genetic and health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing, but that notification deters individuals from obtaining genetic tests. We present some evidence that the latter reflects costs imposed on the supply of genetic testing by hospitals. We find no effects of state genetic antidiscrimination laws on genetic testing rates.

## 13. High-Powered Performance Pay and Crowding Out of Nonmonetary Motives
### Author(s):
- David Huffman
- Michael Bognanno
### Published:
- 23 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
A previous literature cautions that paying workers for performance might crowd out nonmonetary motives to work hard. Empirical evidence from the field, however, has been based on between-subjects designs that are best suited for detecting crowding out due to low-powered incentives. High-powered incentives in the workplace tend to increase output, but it is unknown whether this masks crowding out. This paper uses a within-subject experimental design and finds evidence that crowding out also extends to high-powered incentives in a real work setting with paid workers. There is individual heterogeneity, however, with a minority of workers reporting crowding in of motivation. Thus, the impact of performance pay might depend on the mix of worker types.

## 14. Decentralized Clearing in Financial Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
We consider a situation in which agents have mutual claims on each other, summarized in a liability matrix. Agents’ assets might be insufficient to satisfy their liabilities, leading to defaults. In case of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we introduce a large class of decentralized clearing processes. We show the convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small, all decentralized clearing processes lead essentially to the same value of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication, it is not necessary to collect and process all the sensitive data of all the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure.

## 15. Discrete Nonlinear Optimization by State-Space Decompositions
### Author(s):
- David Bergman
- Andre A. Cire
### Published:
- 29 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
This paper investigates a decomposition approach for binary optimization problems with nonlinear objectives and linear constraints. Our methodology relies on the partition of the objective function into separate low-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) models, each of which can be equivalently represented as a shortest-path problem in an underlying state-transition graph. We show that the associated transition graphs can be related by a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) so as to produce exact solutions to the original nonlinear problem. To address DPs with large state spaces, we present a general relaxation mechanism that dynamically aggregates states during the construction of the transition graphs. The resulting MILP provides both lower and upper bounds to the nonlinear function, and it may be embedded in branch-and-bound procedures to find provably optimal solutions. We describe how to specialize our technique for structured objectives (e.g., submodular functions) and consider three problems arising in revenue management, portfolio optimization, and healthcare. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed technique often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by orders of magnitude in these applications.

## 16. Embedding Formulations and Complexity for Unions of Polyhedra
### Author(s):
- Juan Pablo Vielma
### Published:
- 8 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
It is well known that selecting a good mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation is crucial for effectively obtaining a solution with state-of-the art solvers. Although best practices and guidelines for constructing good formulations abound, there is rarely a single systematic construction approach that leads to the best possible formulation. Here, we introduce embedding formulations and complexity as a new MIP formulation paradigm for systematically constructing formulations for disjunctive constraints that are optimal with respect to size. More specifically, they yield the smallest possible ideal formulation (i.e., one whose LP relaxation has integral extreme points) among all formulations that only use 0-1 auxiliary variables. We use the paradigm to characterize optimal formulations for special ordered sets of type 2 and certain piecewise linear functions of two variables. We also show that the resultant formulations can provide a significant computational advantage over all known formulations for piecewise linear functions.

## 17. Board Structure Mandates: Consequences for Director Location and Financial Reporting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 May 2017
### Abstract:
We examine how the director independence mandates of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) and related reforms affected board geography and the quality of financial reporting. Using 1998–2006 data on the residential addresses of individual directors, we document that the geographic proximity to headquarters of audit committees and other monitoring committees declined upon implementation of the mandates. The decrease in proximity was especially large for those firms that were both SOX noncompliant and supply constrained in local director labor markets at the time the reforms were enacted. Moreover, firms with larger SOX-related losses of director proximity experienced significantly greater post-SOX declines in earnings quality. Our findings therefore suggest that, for some firms, the director independence mandates had unintended consequences for financial reporting quality.

## 18. Two-Sided Reputation in Certification Markets
### Author(s):
- Matthieu Bouvard
- Raphaël Levy
### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
In a market where sellers solicit certification to overcome asymmetric information, we show that the profit of a monopolistic certifier can be hump-shaped in its reputation for accuracy: a higher accuracy attracts high-quality sellers but sometimes repels low-quality sellers. As a consequence, reputational concerns may induce the certifier to reduce information quality, thus depressing welfare. The entry of a second certifier impacts reputational incentives: when sellers only solicit one certifier, competition plays a disciplining role and the region where reputation is bad shrinks. Conversely, this region may expand when sellers hold multiple certifications.

## 19. The Dynamics of Borrower Reputation Following Financial Misreporting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 May 2017
### Abstract:
We study the dynamics of borrower reputation in bank loan markets following revelations of financial misreporting by the borrower. Misreporting firms pay greater loan spreads than matched firms for at least six years following revelation of the misreporting, and there is no evidence of a downward trend in the misreporting premium. Following revelation, misreporting firms are more likely to engage in various actions to potentially rebuild their reputations, but even firms that engage in multiple actions continue to pay greater loan spreads for at least six years. Our results suggest that misreporting causes long-lasting and costly reputation losses that firms find very difficult or prohibitively costly to restore.

## 20. A Theory of Corporate Boards and Forced CEO Turnover
### Author(s):
- Thomas J. Chemmanur
- Viktar Fedaseyeu
### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We model a corporate board evaluating a chief executive officer (CEO) of uncertain management ability. Each director receives a noisy private signal about CEO ability, after which directors discuss this ability and vote to retain or replace the CEO. Directors care about true CEO ability, since it affects their equity holding values; however, a CEO may impose costs of dissent on a director who votes to fire but fails to oust her. We relate the equilibrium CEO firing decision to board size, board composition, the effect of an imprecise public signal, and the cost and probability of finding a good replacement CEO.

## 21. Return to Invested Capital and the Performance of Mergers and Acquisitions
### Author(s):
- Jun “QJ” Qian
- Julie Lei Zhu
### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We evaluate the efficiency of capital deployment for acquiring firms before mergers and acquisitions (M&As), defined as the return on invested capital net of the cost of capital, and link this measure to firms’ postacquisition performance. Acquirers with higher preacquisition net returns on investment have superior long-run operating and stock performance than do acquirers with lower returns. Acquirers with low net returns on investment also underperform matching nonacquirers. The relationship between preacquisition investment return and postacquisition performance is weakened when chief executive officer turnover occurs after deal completion. These results imply that managerial ability in deploying capital and creating value for shareholders persists through M&As.

## 22. Financial Regulatory Reform After the Crisis: An Assessment
### Author(s):
- Darrell Duffie
### Published:
- 3 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
This is a survey of progress with the postcrisis global (G20) reform of the financial system, in five key areas of new regulation: (1) making financial institutions more resilient; (2) ending “too-big-to-fail”; (3) making derivatives markets safer; (4) transforming shadow banking; and (5) improving trade competition and market transparency. The resiliency reforms, particularly bank capital regulations, have been increasingly successful in improving financial stability, but have been accompanied by some reduction in secondary-market liquidity. I review specific areas where reforms are far from complete, or have even been counterproductive.

## 23. Corporate Cash Hoarding: The Role of Just-in-Time Adoption
### Author(s):
- Xiaodan Gao
### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
I explore the role of the just-in-time (JIT) inventory system in the increase in cash holdings by U.S. manufacturing firms. I develop a model to illustrate the mechanism through which JIT affects cash and quantify its impact. In the model, both cash and inventory can serve as working capital. As firms switch from the traditional system to JIT, they shift resources from inventory to cash to facilitate transactions with suppliers. On average, this switchover accounts for a 4.1-percentage-point increase in the cash-to-assets ratio, which is approximately 28% of the change observed in the data.

## 24. Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift and the Return Predictability of Earnings Levels: One Effect or Two?
### Author(s):
- Asad Kausar
### Published:
- 2 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether earnings levels predict future returns distinct from earnings changes. I find that the predictive ability of earnings levels is subsumed by and is not incremental to the predictive ability of earnings changes. Specifically, I find that trading strategies based on net income, operating profitability, and gross profitability do not earn significant abnormal returns after controlling for earnings changes. My evidence suggests that these anomalies are an artifact of post-earnings-announcement drift and the failure to properly control for earnings changes.

## 25. Supporting Tax Policy Change Through Accounting Discretion: Evidence from the 2012 Elections
### Author(s):
- Vishal P. Baloria
- Kenneth J. Klassen
### Published:
- 16 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Some corporations attempt to lessen their tax burden through involvement in the legislative process. We identify firms that contributed to congressional candidates who favor reductions in the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate. This support created a temporary incentive to manage effective tax rates (ETRs) up. We document that these firms increased their reported effective tax rate in the two calendar quarters preceding the 2012 election relative to adjacent periods and other firms supporting candidates in the same election. We find that the variation in upward ETR management is correlated with firm-level proxies for potential reputational costs, capital markets costs, and long-run tax burdens. The variation in upward ETR management is also correlated with firm-candidate-level proxies for strength of relationships and competitiveness of election races. Our findings provide new evidence on accounting choices in support of corporate political activity and on the political cost hypothesis in the tax setting.

## 26. Do Compensation Consultants Enable Higher CEO Pay? A Disclosure Rule Change as a Separating Device
### Author(s):
- Jenny Chu
- Jonathan Faasse
- P. Raghavendra Rau
### Published:
- 25 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
We investigate the impact of a firm’s compensation consultant choice on executive compensation by examining shifts in consultant choice stemming from a 2009 U.S. Securities Exchange Commission requirement that firms disclose fees paid to compensation consultants for both consulting and other services. We show that the disclosure rule change acted as a separating device distinguishing firms likely to have used compensation consultants to extract rents from shareholders from firms that were likely to have used consultants to optimally set pay. We conclude that not all multiservice consultants are conflicted, while not all specialist consultants are guardians of shareholder value. Our study provides a more nuanced view of the association between compensation consultant choices and executive pay.

## 27. Automated Earnings Forecasts: Beat Analysts or Combine and Conquer?
### Author(s):
- Ryan T. Ball
- Eric Ghysels
### Published:
- 27 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
Prior studies attribute analysts’ forecast superiority over time-series forecasting models to their access to a large set of firm, industry, and macroeconomic information (an information advantage), which they use to update their forecasts on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (a timing advantage). This study leverages recently developed mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regression methods to synthesize a broad spectrum of high frequency data to construct forecasts of firm-level earnings. We compare the accuracy of these forecasts to those of analysts at short horizons of one quarter or less. We find that our MIDAS forecasts are more accurate and have forecast errors that are smaller than analysts’ when forecast dispersion is high and when the firm size is smaller. In addition, we find that combining our MIDAS forecasts with analysts’ forecasts systematically outperforms analysts alone, which indicates that our MIDAS models provide information orthogonal to analysts. Our results provide preliminary support for the potential to automate the process of forecasting firm-level earnings, or other accounting performance measures, on a high-frequency basis.

## 28. Prehire Screening and Subjective Performance Evaluations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
We study a two-stage model in which the agent’s ability is initially unknown to any party, but the principal can choose a prehire screening scheme to discover the agent’s ability before offering a contract. Perfect screening enables the principal to fine-tune the contract to the agent’s ability, but it also prevents her from enforcing a contract that is contingent on subjective interim performance measures. Given that interim performance measures are critical for motivating first-stage effort, the principal may benefit from adopting no screening or partial screening. When partial screening is employed, the halo effect—a commonly observed bias in subjective evaluation practices—emerges in the equilibrium.
