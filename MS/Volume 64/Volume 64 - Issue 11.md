## 1. Doing Well by Making Well: The Impact of Corporate Wellness Programs on Employee Productivity
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper investigates the impact of a corporate wellness program on worker productivity using a panel of objective health and productivity data from 111 workers in five laundry plants. Although almost 90% of companies use wellness programs, existing research has focused on cost savings from insurance and absenteeism. We find productivity improvements based both on program participation and postprogram health changes. Sick and healthy individuals who improved their health increased productivity by about 10%, with surveys indicating sources in improved diet and exercise. Although the small worker sample limits both estimate precision and our ability to isolate mechanisms behind this increase, we argue that our results are consistent with improved worker motivation and capability. The study suggests that firms can increase operational productivity through socially responsible health policies that improve both workers’ wellness and economic value, and provides a template for future large-scale studies of health and productivity.

### Abstract:
Can raising awareness of racial bias subsequently reduce that bias? We address this question by exploiting the widespread media attention highlighting racial bias among professional basketball referees that occurred in May 2007 following the release of an academic study. Using new data, we confirm that racial bias persisted in the years after the study’s original sample but prior to the media coverage. Subsequent to the media coverage, though, the bias disappeared. Several potential mechanisms may have produced this result, including voluntary behavior changes by individual referees, adjustments by players to new information, and changes in referee behavior due to institutional pressure. These results suggest a new kind of Hawthorne effect in which greater scrutiny of even subtle forms of bias can bring about meaningful change.

## 3. Implications of Market Spillovers

### Published:
- 19 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
In recent years, several firms have decided to withdraw from profitable markets, believing the move will be beneficial for their overall business. For instance, CVS dropped tobacco products from its shelves in 2014, while Aldi dropped confectionery from its checkout lines in 2016. Findings from consumers’ evaluation of such moves suggest there exists a negative market spillover from selling in a market, such that a firm’s participation in one market reduces consumers’ willingness to pay for the firm’s products in other markets. On the other hand, certain socially favorable markets, such as markets for environment-friendly products, have been shown to create a positive market spillover for their sellers, increasing consumers’ willingness to pay in other markets the sellers participate in. We build an analytical model of two competing firms to examine how firms react to a market spillover and find the conditions under which different firms would sell in the spillover-producing market. Our analysis of how firms’ profits are affected by market spillovers identifies the consumers’ reservation value in the spillover-producing market, the relative size of the two markets, and the extent of the market spillover as key factors determining which firms benefit from a market spillover. Interestingly, we find it is possible for both firms to make more profit with a negative market spillover compared to when there is no market spillover, while a positive market spillover can actually result in lower profits for both firms compared to no market spillover.

## 4. Competitive vs. Complementary Effects in Online Social Networks and News Consumption: A Natural Experiment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 29 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
Using hourly traffic and readership data from a major news website, and taking advantage of a global Facebook outage, we study the relationship between social networks and online news consumption. More specifically, we test if online social networks compete with content providers or instead play a complementary role by promoting and attracting traffic to external websites. During the outage, consistent with a promotional effect, we observe a significant decrease in traffic and unique visitors to the news website lasting beyond the outage hours. We further find that direct referrals from Facebook links grossly underestimated the actual impact of Facebook in generating traffic. Instead, during the outage, we observe a more significant reduction in visitors arriving at the news website from search engines or directly typing the website URL or using bookmarks. Additionally, readership of articles and types of pages viewed also changed during the outage. Although we observe a drop in news consumption during the outage hours for all news categories, the subsequent news consumption differs across categories. Time sensitive categories like sports and local news see an increase in consumption, whereas news on women issues or health topics see a decrease. Analysis of individual-level visit and readership behavior during the outage also reveals that Facebook not only introduces selectivity bias by attracting shallower readers but also changes readership patterns (in the absence of Facebook, visitors engage in more in-depth reading). To test the generalizability of our results, we study the impact of the outage on referrals from other social media outlets, on other news sites, and on other content and e-commerce sites. We find similar effects on other news providers, whereas data from nonnews sites, including e-commerce, show no major outage effects. Overall, our results have important managerial implications. We highlight how our results unearth the importance of search engine optimization and of strong branding for news websites, if providers want to harness fully the power of their social media presence.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Managing perishable inventory systems with positive lead times and finite ordering capacities is important but notoriously difficult in both theory and computation. The optimal control policy is extremely complicated, and no effective heuristic policy has been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we develop an easy-to-compute approximation algorithm for this class of problems and prove that it admits a theoretical worst-case performance guarantee under independent and many commonly used positively correlated demand processes. Our worst-case analysis departs significantly from those in the previous studies, requiring several novel ideas. In particular, we introduce a transient unit-matching rule to dynamically match the supply and demand units, and the notion of associated demand processes that provides the right future demand information to establish the desired results. Our numerical study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

## 6. Dynamic Mechanisms with Martingale Utilities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We study the dynamic mechanism design problem of a seller who repeatedly sells independent items to a buyer with private values. In this setting, the seller could potentially extract the entire buyer surplus by running efficient auctions and charging an upfront participation fee at the beginning of the horizon. In some markets, such as Internet advertising, participation fees are not practical since buyers expect to inspect items before purchasing them. This motivates us to study the design of dynamic mechanisms under successively more stringent requirements that capture the implicit business constraints of these markets. We first consider a periodic individual rationality constraint, which limits the mechanism to charge at most the buyer’s value in each period. While this prevents large upfront participation fees, the seller can still design mechanisms that spread a participation fee across multiple initial auctions. These mechanisms have the unappealing feature that they provide close-to-zero buyer utility in earlier auctions in exchange for higher utility in later auctions. To address this problem, we introduce a martingale utility constraint, which imposes the requirement that from the perspective of the buyer, the next item’s expected utility is equal to the present one’s. Our main result is providing a dynamic auction satisfying martingale utility and periodic individual rationality whose loss in profit with respect to first-best (full extraction of buyer surplus) is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. The proposed mechanism is a dynamic two-tier auction with a hard floor and a soft floor that allocates the item whenever the buyer’s bid is above the hard floor and charges the minimum of the bid and the soft floor.

## 7. Design Incentives Under Collective Extended Producer Responsibility: A Network Perspective

### Published:
- 19 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
A key goal of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation is to provide incentives for producers to design their products for recyclability. EPR is typically implemented in a collective system, where a network of recycling resources are coordinated to fulfill the EPR obligations of a set of producers, and the resulting system cost is allocated among these producers. Collective EPR is prevalent because of its cost efficiency advantages. However, it is considered to provide inferior design incentives compared to an individual implementation (where producers fulfill their EPR obligations individually). In this paper, we revisit this assertion and investigate its fundamental underpinnings in a network setting. To this end, we develop a new biform game framework that captures producers’ independent design choices (noncooperative stage) and recognizes the need to maintain the voluntary participation of producers for the collective system to be stable (cooperative stage). This biform game subsumes the network-based operations of a collective system and captures the interdependence between producers’ product design and participation decisions. We then characterize the manner in which design improvement may compromise stability and vice versa. We establish that a stable collective EPR implementation can match and even surpass an individual implementation with respect to product design outcomes. In particular, we show that when the processing technology efficiency and product recyclability are substitutes (complements), a recycling network where processor capacity pooling leads to sufficiently low (high) cost reduction will lead to superior designs in the collective system and maintain its stability, and we propose cost allocation mechanisms to achieve this dual purpose.

## 8. Advertising Content and Consumer Engagement on Social Media: Evidence from Facebook
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
We describe the effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement using data from Facebook. We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement—defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs—with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality—like humor and emotion—is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content—like mentions of price and deals—is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality–related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers’ path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook’s EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook’s behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality–related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.

## 9. How Does Advertising Depend on Competition? Evidence from U.S. Brewing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
The relationship between market structure and advertising has been extensively studied, but has generated sharply opposing theoretical predictions, as well as inconclusive empirical findings, likely because of severe endogeneity concerns. We exploit the 2008 merger of Miller and Coors in the U.S. brewing industry to examine how changes in local concentration affect firms’ advertising behavior. Well-established regional preferences over beer brands, and the sharp increase in concentration from the merger, make this an excellent setting to analyze this question. We find a significant positive effect of local market concentration on advertising expenditures: a 100-point increase in the Herfindahl–Hirschmann Index measure of concentration increases advertising per capita by about 5%. Our findings shed light on how and when firms choose to deploy advertising.

## 10. The Effects of Autoscaling in Cloud Computing

### Published:
- 19 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
Web-based firms often rely on cloud-based computational resources to serve customers, but the number of customers they will serve is rarely known at the time of product launch. A recent innovation in cloud computing, known as autoscaling, allows companies to automatically scale their computational load up or down to match customer demand. We build a game theory model to examine how autoscaling will affect firms’ decisions to enter a new market and the resulting equilibrium prices, profitability, and consumer surplus. The model produces novel results depending on the likelihood of a firm’s success in the new market, differentiation among potential entrants, and the cost of computational capacity. For instance, in contrast to previous capacity commitment models with demand certainty, we show that autoscaling can mitigate price competition if the likelihood of a firm’s success in the market is moderate and the cost of capacity is sufficiently low. This is because without autoscaling, the firms’ uncertainty about demand would lead to excessive computational capacities and thus aggressive price competition. We also find that when the likelihood of success is sufficiently high, autoscaling facilitates entry for one firm yet deters a second firm from simultaneously entering the market.

## 11. Training Aspiring Entrepreneurs to Pitch Experienced Investors: Evidence from a Field Experiment in the United States
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
Accredited investors finance more than 75,000 U.S. startups annually. We explain how training aspiring entrepreneurs to pitch their new business ideas to these investors affects their odds of continued funding discussions. We model accredited investors’ decision to continue investigation as a real option whose value is a function of their experience and the information contained in the entrepreneurs’ pitches. We derive four hypotheses from the model, which we test through a field experiment that randomly assigns pitch training at four elevator pitch competitions. The data support all four hypotheses and are inconsistent with alternative explanations.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Telemedical physician triage (TPT) is an example of a hierarchical knowledge-based service system (HKBSS) in which a second level of decision agent (telemedical physician) renders a decision on cases referred to him or her by the primary level agents (triage nurses). Managing the speed-versus-quality trade-off in such systems presents a unique challenge because of the interplay between agent knowledge and flow of work between the two levels. We develop a novel model of agent knowledge, based on the beta distribution, and deploy it in a partially observable Markov decision process model to describe the optimal policy for deciding which cases (patients) to refer to the second level for further evaluation. We show that this policy has a monotone control-limit structure that reduces the fraction of decisions made at the upper level as workload increases. Because the optimal policy is complex, we use structural insights from it to design two practical heuristics. These heuristics enable an HKBSS to adapt efficiently to workload shifts by adjusting the criteria for referring decisions to the upper level based on partial real-time queue length information. Finally, we conduct analytic and numerical analyses to derive insights into the management of a TPT system. We find that (1) the telemedical physician should evaluate more patients as congestion in the emergency room waiting area increases; (2) training that improves accuracy of the physician and/or nurses can be effective even if it only does so for a single patient type, but training that improves consistency must do so for all patient types to be effective; and (3) patient classification in triage should consider environmental and operational conditions in addition to the patient’s medical condition.

## 13. Effects of Recommendation Neutrality and Sponsorship Disclosure on Trust vs. Distrust in Online Recommendation Agents: Moderating Role of Explanations for Organic Recommendations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
We extend the extant research on neutral recommendation agents (RAs) to those that lack recommendation neutrality and are biased toward sponsors. We first investigate the effects of recommendation neutrality on users’ trust and distrust in RAs by comparing a biased RA with sponsorship disclosure with a neutral RA. We then apply a contingency approach to examine the effects of sponsorship disclosure on users’ trust and distrust in biased RAs, with explanations for organic recommendations as a contingent factor. A laboratory experiment was conducted in the United States. We determine that users’ trust in the biased RA with sponsorship disclosure is lower and that their distrust is higher than that in the neutral RA. Results also show that user trust in a biased RA increases only when explanations for organic recommendations and sponsorship disclosure are both provided. Users’ perceived psychological contract violations of an RA have been verified as a key mediator of the examined effects. However, explanations for organic recommendations, sponsorship disclosure, or their combination fail to significantly lower users’ distrust in a biased RA. A second experiment conducted in Hong Kong confirms the major findings of the experiment conducted in the United States. Theoretical contributions and practical implications for e-commerce RAs are discussed.

## 14. Bricks-and-Mortar Entry by Online Retailers in the Presence of Consumer Sales Taxes
### Author(s):
- Anil Arya
- Brian Mittendorf
### Published:
- 2 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
This paper presents a parsimonious model of the bricks-and-mortar entry choice of online retailers in light of consumer sales taxes. On the one hand, a retailer benefits by entry since the second distribution channel enables it to reach new customers, giving it a leg up on rivals. On the other hand, physical entry typically compels the retailer to start collecting sales taxes even for online transactions, making its consumers particularly price sensitive. This paper examines this trade-off to characterize a retailer’s entry decision, as well as the market-level equilibrium of bricks-and-mortar penetration. The paper then layers in supply market considerations—namely, the retailer’s procurement of products from upstream suppliers. The analysis demonstrates that sales taxes not only reduce the consumers’ willingness to pay for products in the retail market, but also dampen the retailer’s willingness to pay for the products in the wholesale arena. This reluctance influences the clearing price in the supply market and, thus, the firm’s decision to establish the physical retail store.

## 15. Team Leadership and Performance: Combining the Roles of Direction and Contribution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
In knowledge-intensive projects, one of the challenges project team leaders often face is how to combine their roles of direction and contribution. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic model of team leadership of coproductive projects and study how team leaders should combine their directing and contributing efforts depending on the team and project characteristics. Our analysis reveals that two types of team leadership approaches arise in equilibrium, namely, “participatory” team leadership, under which the team leader gives the team members full discretion on their choice of effort, and “directive” team leadership, under which the team leader demands team members exert higher effort than what they would choose to exert voluntarily. We find that directive team leadership is optimal when the team members have low incentives, that is, when their rewards are low, the size of the team is large, or failure is not too costly (e.g., continuation is possible); otherwise, participatory team leadership is optimal. Moreover, we show that a higher degree of effort complementarity (as in innovative projects) leads to greater alignment between the team leader’s and team members’ contributing efforts, which, under directive team leadership, also implies greater alignment between the team leader’s directing and contributing efforts. Finally, the team leader should set the team size and team members’ rewards in a way that accentuates the difference between the two team leadership approaches. That is, under directive team leadership, she should set a large team size and offer the team members low rewards whereas under participatory team leadership she should set a small team size and offer the team members high rewards.

## 16. Optimal Revelation of Life-Changing Information
### Author(s):

- Nora Szech
### Published:
- 21 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
Information about the future may be instrumentally useful yet scary. For example, many patients shy away from precise genetic tests about their dispositions for severe diseases. They are afraid that a bad test result could render them desperate as a result of anticipatory feelings. We show that partially revealing tests are typically optimal when anticipatory utility interacts with an instrumental need for information. The same result emerges when patients rely on probability weighting. Optimal tests provide only two signals, which renders them easily implementable. While the good signal is typically precise, the bad one remains coarse. This way, patients have a substantial chance to learn that they are free of the genetic risk in question. Yet even if the test outcome is bad, they do not end in a situation without hope.

## 17. The Costs and Beliefs Implied by Direct Stock Ownership
### Author(s):
- Daniel Barth
### Published:
- 28 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
This paper develops and estimates an economic model of the costs and beliefs required to rationalize household direct stock ownership. In the model, investors believe they can learn information about individual stock returns through costly research. The model identifies the distributions of both research costs and beliefs about the predictability of individual stock returns. Identification depends only on households’ wealth and portfolio choices. The model also provides a novel explanation for many empirical features of household portfolios. Parameter estimates suggest that most households have modest beliefs about the benefits of individual stock research, although a minority must expect extraordinary returns.

## 18. Residual Inflation Risk
### Author(s):
- Philipp Karl Illeditsch
### Published:
- 16 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
I decompose inflation risk into (i) a component that is correlated with factors that determine investors’ preferences and investment opportunities and real returns on real assets with risky cash flows (stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.), and (ii) a residual inflation risk component. In equilibrium, only the first component earns a risk premium. Therefore, investors should avoid exposure to the residual component. All nominal bonds, including money-market accounts, have constant nominal cash flows, and thus their real returns are equally exposed to residual inflation risk. In contrast, inflation-protected bonds provide a means to avoid cash flow and residual inflation risk. Hence, every investor should put 100% of her wealth in real assets (inflation-protected bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.) and finance every long/short position in nominal bonds with an equal amount of other nominal bonds or by borrowing/lending cash; that is, investors should hold a zero-investment portfolio of nominal bonds and cash.

## 19. The Hot-Hand Fallacy: Cognitive Mistakes or Equilibrium Adjustments? Evidence from Major League Baseball
### Author(s):
- Brett Green
- Jeffrey Zwiebel
### Published:
- 15 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We test for a “hot hand” (i.e., short-term predictability in performance) in Major League Baseball using panel data. We find strong evidence for its existence in all 10 statistical categories we consider. The magnitudes are significant; being “hot” corresponds to between one-half and one standard deviation in the distribution of player abilities. Our results are in notable contrast to the majority of the hot-hand literature, which has generally found either no hot hand or a very weak hot hand in sports, often employing basketball shooting data. We argue that this difference is attributable to endogenous defensive responses: basketball presents sufficient opportunity for transferring defensive resources to equate shooting probabilities across players, whereas baseball does not. We then develop a method to test whether baseball teams do respond appropriately to hot opponents. Our results suggest teams respond in a manner consistent with drawing correct inference about the magnitude of the hot hand except for a tendency to overreact to very recent performance (i.e., the last five attempts).

## 20. Investor Overconfidence, Firm Valuation, and Corporate Decisions
### Author(s):
- Biljana N. Adebambo
- Xuemin (Sterling) Yan
### Published:
- 21 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Behavioral theory predicts that investor overconfidence leads to overpricing because overconfident investors overestimate the quality of their information and underestimate risk. We test this prediction by using a measure of investor overconfidence derived from the characteristics and holdings of U.S. equity mutual fund managers. We find that firms with more overconfident investors are relatively overvalued based on the market-to-book ratio and a misvaluation measure. The result is stronger among stocks with greater mutual fund ownership, particularly by active mutual funds. Firms with more overconfident investors also exhibit lower subsequent stock returns, issue more equity, and invest more. Overall, our findings suggest that investor overconfidence is significantly related to firm valuation and corporate decisions.

## 21. Get in Line: Chapter 11 Restructuring in Crowded Bankruptcy Courts
### Author(s):
- Benjamin Iverson
### Published:
- 21 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Bankruptcy costs depend not only on the laws that govern financial distress but also on the ability of the court to rehabilitate distressed firms. This paper tests whether Chapter 11 restructuring outcomes are affected by time constraints in busy bankruptcy courts. Using the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act as an exogenous shock to caseloads, I find that commercial banks report lower charge-offs on business lending when court caseloads decline, suggesting that the costs of financial distress are lower in less-congested courts. Further, court caseload affects how restructuring takes place. Less-busy bankruptcy judges liquidate fewer small firms, but more large firms. When caseload declines, large firms spend less time in court and firms that are dismissed from court are less likely to refile for bankruptcy. In addition, firms are less likely to sell assets or obtain debtor-in-possession financing in less-busy courts.

## 22. When Risk Is Weird: Unexplained Transaction Features Lower Valuations
### Author(s):
- Robert Mislavsky
- Uri Simonsohn
### Published:
- 4 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We define transactions as weird when they include unexplained features, that is, features not implicitly, explicitly, or self-evidently justified, and propose that people are averse to weird transactions. In six experiments, we show that risky options used in previous research paradigms often attained uncertainty via adding an unexplained transaction feature (e.g., purchasing a coin flip or lottery), and behavior that appears to reflect risk aversion could instead reflect an aversion to weird transactions. Specifically, willingness to pay drops just as much when adding risk to a transaction as when adding unexplained features. Holding transaction features constant, adding additional risk does not further reduce willingness to pay. We interpret our work as generalizing ambiguity aversion to riskless choice.

## 23. Simulating Macro-Level Effects from Micro-Level Observations
### Author(s):
- Edward Bishop Smith
- William Rand
### Published:
- 27 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We consider the fruits of integrating agent-based modeling (ABM) with lab-based experimental research with human subjects. While both ABM and lab experiments have similar aims—to identify the rules, tendencies, and heuristics by which individual agents make decisions and respond to external stimuli—they work toward their common goal in notably different ways. Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers ascribe individual simulated “agents” with decision rules describing their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate “macro” level empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab, and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level observations that can be difficult to observe in the field. We offer an example of this mixed-method approach related to status, social networks, and job search and issue guidance for future research attempting such integration.

## 24. The Many Gifts of Status: How Attending to Audience Reactions Drives the Use of Status
### Author(s):
- Amanda J. Sharkey
- Balázs Kovács
### Published:
- 22 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
The majority of extant studies involving status argue that status enters into choice and evaluation because people personally believe that status serves as a signal of quality. However, this mechanism seems less plausible in cases when consensus on the meaning of quality is lacking. To understand how and why status often nonetheless enters into evaluation in those cases, this paper contributes to a growing body of work that proposes that individuals and organizations are particularly likely to base their choices and evaluations on status when they are concerned with the reactions of others. We provide an empirical test of this argument by analyzing how the sales gap between prizewinning books and their shortlisted-only peers (as well as a second similar-content control group) changes during the December holidays, when the purchase of books as gifts increases relative to purchases for one’s own personal use. Results show that the sales gap widens with the increased orientation toward gift giving, consistent with our theoretical arguments about how attending to audience reactions drives the use of status. Analyses of two online experiments allow for further clarification of the mechanism behind our findings.

## 25. Once in the Door: Gender, Tryouts, and the Initial Salaries of Managers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
Although women pursue managerial credentials at nearly the same rate as men, gender disparities in wages exist because of the shortfall in wages women sustain relative to men at the onset of their careers. This article develops a tryout approach to test for the presence of demand-side contributions to initial wage inequality while also developing and testing theory on why it may be lessened through internships. Using detailed data on graduates from an elite management program from 2009–2010, our analyses reveal that internships are associated with the gap in men’s and women’s initial salaries. For men, there is no difference in salary offers from employers where an internship occurs versus one where an internship does not occur. However, women receive higher salaries from employers where an internship first takes place.
