## 2. Shareholder Litigation and Ownership Structure: Evidence from a Natural Experiment

### Abstract:
We use a natural experiment to identify a causal effect of the threat of shareholder litigation on ownership structure, governance, and firm performance. We find that when it becomes harder for small shareholders to litigate, ownership becomes more concentrated and shifts from individuals to institutions. Director and officer governance protections drop among these firms, and operating performance drops among firms whose ownership structure does not change. These results suggest that the ability of shareholders to coordinate and litigate against management is important for governance.

## 3. Intellectual Property Strategy and the Long Tail: Evidence from the Recorded Music Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Digitization has impacted firm profitability in many media industries by lowering the cost of copying and sharing creative works. I examine the impact of digital rights management (DRM), a prevalent strategy used by firms in media industries to address piracy concerns, on music sales. I exploit a natural experiment, where different labels remove DRM from their entire catalogue of music at different times, to examine whether relaxing an album’s sharing restrictions increases sales. Using a large sample of albums from all four major record labels, I find that removing DRM increases digital music sales by 10%, but relaxing sharing restrictions does not impact all albums equally. It increases the sales of lower-selling albums (i.e., the “long tail”) significantly (40%) but does not benefit top-selling albums. These results suggest that reducing search costs facilitates the discovery of niche products.

## 4. An Empirical Analysis of Self-Enforcement Mechanisms: Evidence from Hotel Franchising
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
The relational contracts literature suggests that a principal can improve contract self-enforceability by specifying initial requirements that increase the agent’s ex post rents. Initial requirements specified in hotel franchise agreements—size and quality tier of the hotel—offer a unique empirical setting to test this. Using proprietary data on 5,547 new franchised hotels and their revenues, we find that hotels far away from their franchisor’s headquarters are larger, more likely to belong to a high quality tier, and generate higher revenues ex post. This supports the idea that the agent’s ex post rents can serve as a substitute to the principal’s monitoring intensity in the mitigation of agency problems. Our findings shed light on how formal contract terms can influence informal (relational) contracts between business partners.

## 5. The Impact of Idea Generation and Potential Appropriation on Entrepreneurship: An Experimental Study
### Author(s):
- Soheil Hooshangi
- George Loewenstein
### Published:
- 27 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Using a novel experimental paradigm, we explore how the experience of generating an idea and the possibility that another investor might adopt a rejected investment opportunity, bias the investment decisions of innovator and imitator entrepreneurs. We find that individuals who generate a business idea form biased evaluations of the economic potential of ideas, be it their own idea or somebody else’s idea. On the one hand, they are overconfident about the value of, and overly likely to invest in, their own idea. On the other hand, when investing in another person’s idea, even if it is not competing with their own idea, they are underconfident about the value of, and insufficiently likely to invest in, the idea. Surprisingly, we find that entrepreneurial experience exacerbates this pattern of over- and underconfidence. In addition, we find that the threat that another investor can appropriate a declined investment opportunity increases willingness to invest. We propose a theoretical account to explain the observed pattern of over- and underconfidence in imitative and innovative entrepreneurship. Our findings challenge the traditional account that lowering the cost of imitation has a disincentive effect on the investment decisions of pioneer entrepreneurs and provide evidence that a more lenient appropriability regime may, unexpectedly, have positive effects on entrepreneurship. Our findings also identify new psychological mechanisms that can play a role in important phenomena such as the emergence of spin-offs and rush to market entry.

## 6. Corporate Governance and Costs of Equity: Theory and Evidence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
We propose and test an alternative explanation for the existence of the positive governance–return relation in the 1990s and its disappearance in the 2000s: The governance–return relation is positive under good states of the economy and negative under bad states. Corporate governance mitigates investment distortions so that firms with strong governance have more valuable investment options during booms and more valuable divestiture options during busts than the ones with weak governance. Because investment options are riskier and divestiture options are less risky than assets in place, the expected returns of strongly governed firms are higher during booms but lower during busts than the weakly governed ones. Empirical evidence is consistent with our hypothesis.

## 7. Everything We Do, You Do: The Licensing Effect of Prosocial Marketing Messages on Consumer Behavior
### Author(s):
- Maryam Kouchaki

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Do prosocial corporate marketing messages promote consumers’ altruistic behaviors, or do they advance self-interested and self-indulgent actions? To answer this question, the current research investigates the impact of different framings of prosocial marketing messages on consumers’ behaviors and choices more generally. Results from six laboratory studies and a field experiment demonstrate that exposure to messages that praise customers for good deeds can increase subsequent self-interested and self-indulgent behaviors more than messages that publicize a company’s good deeds or thank consumers for their patronage. Our findings demonstrate the possibility that a temporary boost in one’s self-concept drives this observed effect. In addition, the recipient’s level of support for the issue praised for moderates the effect of customer-praise messages on the recipient’s less altruistic behaviors. This paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications.

## 8. Callable Contingent Capital: Valuation and Default Risk
### Author(s):
- Weidong Tian
### Published:
- 18 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
This paper proposes the use of contingent capital with a call provision, in which the insurer has an option to redeem the contingent capital at any time. I characterize in detail a unique dynamic equilibrium of common stock, subordinated contingent capital, and a senior standard bond under a simple yet sufficient and necessary condition that can be implemented easily. I further show that the issuance of callable contingent capital does not affect the default risk of an outstanding senior standard bond. As a result, callable contingent capital provides an alternative design for contingent capital using a prudential capital structure for a bank that is “too big to fail.”

## 9. Impact of Electricity Pricing Policies on Renewable Energy Investments and Carbon Emissions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on the renewable investment level. We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system. We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.

## 10. Egregiousness and Boycott Intensity: Evidence from the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Oct 2016
### Abstract:
Consumer boycotts are triggered by egregious events, but the literature has not distinguished the level of egregiousness from consumers’ preferences or disutility associated with a given level of egregiousness, nor has the literature studied how these two components of egregiousness affect boycott intensity. We provide a model of market-level boycotts that distinguishes the two egregiousness components. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the market-level intensity of consumer boycotting of BP-branded gasoline, which was triggered by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, increased with the spill’s egregiousness level, approximated by the officially reported daily amount of oil leaked into the ocean and by other measures (i.e., the duration of the spill and the intensity of media coverage), and with consumers’ disutility from egregiousness, approximated by an area’s environmentalism and its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico.

## 11. Market Exit Through Divestment—The Effect of Accounting Bias on Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
We analyze the effect of accounting bias on the competition and market structure of an industry. In our model, firms’ interim accounting reports on investment projects may contain bias introduced by the mandatory accounting system. We find that this bias strictly decreases firms’ profits when investors do not have an abandonment option, but different results emerge when we allow the investors to divest in the interim. Specifically, a conservative accounting regime may increase the likelihood of projects being discontinued, inducing some firms to exit from the product market and leaving rivals to capture their market share. A conservative regime can thus soften market competition and result in ex ante higher investment payoff, higher consumer surplus, and higher total social welfare. Since industries often have common reporting standards, we also identify the degrees of industry-wide accounting bias that maximize the expected investor payoffs. Finally, we allow for investors to coordinate their divestment decisions when both firms report unfavorable costs and show an improvement to both firm profits and consumer surplus.

## 12. Assessing Fair Lending Risks Using Race/Ethnicity Proxies
### Author(s):
- Yan Zhang
### Published:
- 17 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
Fair lending analysis of nonmortgage credit products often involves proxying for race/ethnicity since such information is not required to be reported. Using mortgage data, this paper evaluates a series of proxy approaches (geo, surname, geo-surname, and Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG)) as compared with the race/ethnicity reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The BISG proxy predicts the reported race/ethnicity the best as judged by prediction bias, correlation coefficient, and discriminatory power. In assessing fair lending risks where classification of race/ethnicity is called for, we propose the BISG maximum classification, which produces a more accurate estimation of mortgage pricing disparities than the current practices. The above conclusions withhold various robustness tests. Additional analysis is performed to assess the proxies on nonmortgage credits by leveraging consumer credit bureau data.

## 13. Uncertainty and Sectoral Shifts: The Interaction Between Firm-Level and Aggregate-Level Shocks, and Macroeconomic Activity
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 7 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
This study predicts and finds that the interaction of firm-level and aggregate-level shocks explains a significant portion of shocks to macroeconomic activity. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relation between uncertainty and economic growth is most pronounced when both firm-level and aggregate-level uncertainty are high simultaneously. Similarly, we hypothesize that aggregate performance affects unemployment most when both firm-level dispersion is high and aggregate performance is low, based on the sectoral shift theory. Our hypotheses and empirical results show that the interactive effect of firm-level and aggregate-level shocks are larger than the sum of the individual effects.

## 14. Risk Targeting and Policy Illusions—Evidence from the Announcement of the Volcker Rule
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
We analyze the Volcker Rule’s announcement effects on U.S. bank holding companies. In line with the rule and the banks’ public compliance announcements, we find that those banks that are affected by the Volcker Rule already reduced their trading books relative to their total assets 2.34% more than other banks. However, the announcement of the rule did not reduce the banks’ overall risk taking. To keep their risk targets, the affected banks raised the riskiness of their asset returns. We also find some evidence that the affected banks raised their trading risk and decreased the hedging of their banking business.

### Abstract:
In Chinese culture, certain digits are lucky and others unlucky. We test how such numerological superstition affects financial decision in the China initial public offering (IPO) market. We find that the frequency of lucky numerical stock listing codes exceeds what would be expected by chance. Also consistent with superstition effects, newly listed firms with lucky listing codes experience inferior post-IPO abnormal returns. Further tests suggest that our conclusions are not driven by endogeneity.

## 16. How Monitoring Influences Trust: A Tale of Two Faces
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Nov 2016
### Abstract:
Monitoring changes the behavior of those who are monitored and those who monitor others. We studied behavior under different monitoring regimes in repeated trust games. We found that trustees behaved opportunistically when they anticipated monitoring—they were compliant when they knew in advance that they would be monitored, but exploited trustors when they knew in advance that they would not be monitored. Interestingly, trustors failed to anticipate how strategically their counterparts would behave. Trustors misattributed the strategic, compliant behavior they observed as signals of trustees’ trustworthiness. As a result, trustors misplaced their trust when they were unable to monitor their counterparts. We discuss the managerial implications of our results for designing and implementing monitoring systems.

## 17. Target-Adjusted Utility Functions and Expected-Utility Paradoxes
### Author(s):
- Mark Schneider
- Robert Day
### Published:
- 2 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
Experimental tests of expected-utility theory (EU) have accumulated empirical observations in which the predictions of EU are systematically violated. The cumulative prospect theory (CPT) explains violations such as the Allais paradoxes and fourfold pattern of risk attitudes as resulting from nonlinear probability transformations. Here we show that the classical paradoxes for decisions under risk can be explained with preferences that are linear in probabilities for any choice set and that maximize an expected-utility function with respect to an endogenous target return. We introduce the maximin payoff as a plausible and even natural target return from a choice set and show that the resulting target-adjusted utility (TAU) model explains additional empirical observations such as the scale dependence of the Allais paradox that cannot be explained by standard specifications of CPT. Further, using data from three prominent laboratory experiments, we find that TAU is effective in explaining observed behaviors.

### Published:

### Abstract:
We explore how individuals assess the quality of financial advice they receive and how they form judgments about advisers. Using an incentivized discrete choice experiment, we show that first impressions matter: consumers more often follow advisers who dispense good advice before bad. We demonstrate how clients’ opinions of adviser quality can be manipulated by using an easily replicated confirmation strategy that depends on the quality of the advice and the difficulty and order of the advice topics. Our results also reveal how clients benefit from their own past experience and how they use professional credentials to guide their choices.

## 19. Hierarchical Maximum Likelihood Parameter Estimation for Cumulative Prospect Theory: Improving the Reliability of Individual Risk Parameter Estimates
### Author(s):
- Ryan O. Murphy
- Robert H. W. ten Brincke
### Published:
- 6 Jan 2017
### Abstract:
An individual’s tolerance of risk can be quantified by using decision models with tuned parameters that maximally fit a set of risky choices the individual has made. A goal of this model fitting procedure is to identify parameters that correspond to stable underlying risk preferences. These preferences can be modeled as an individual difference, indicating a particular decision maker’s tastes and willingness to accept risk. Using hierarchical statistical methods, we show significant improvements in the reliability of individual risk preference parameter estimates over other common methods for cumulative prospect theory. This hierarchical procedure uses population-level information (in addition to an individual’s choices) to break “ties” (or near ties) in the fit quality for sets of possible risk preference parameters. By breaking these statistical ties in a sensible way, researchers can avoid overfitting choice data and thus more resiliently measure individual differences in people’s risk preferences.

## 20. Minimizing Risk Exposure When the Choice of a Risk Measure Is Ambiguous
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 3 Jan 2017
### Abstract:
Since the financial crisis of 2007–2009, there has been a renewed interest in quantifying more appropriately the risks involved in financial positions. Popular risk measures such as variance and value-at-risk have been found inadequate because we now give more importance to properties such as monotonicity, convexity, translation invariance, positive homogeneity, and law invariance. Unfortunately, the challenge remains that it is unclear how to choose a risk measure that faithfully represents a decision maker’s true risk attitude. In this work, we show that one can account precisely for (neither more nor less than) what we know of the risk preferences of an investor/policy maker when comparing and optimizing financial positions. We assume that the decision maker can commit to a subset of the above properties (the use of a law invariant convex risk measure for example) and that he can provide a series of assessments comparing pairs of potential risky payoffs. Given this information, we propose to seek financial positions that perform best with respect to the most pessimistic estimation of the level of risk potentially perceived by the decision maker. We present how this preference robust risk minimization problem can be solved numerically by formulating convex optimization problems of reasonable size. Numerical experiments on a portfolio selection problem, where the problem reduces to a linear program, will illustrate the advantages of accounting for the fact that the choice of a risk measure is ambiguous.

## 21. Effectiveness of Reputation in Contracting for Customized Production: Evidence from Online Labor Markets
### Author(s):
- Mingfeng Lin
- Yong Liu
- Siva Viswanathan
### Published:
- 16 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
This study examines the effects of reputation in the nascent but rapidly growing online labor markets. In these markets, contract winners (vendors) provide clients with customized products such as computer software, business plans, and artistic designs. The products are used primarily for business purposes and require time for production after project-specific contracts are awarded. These characteristics render it unclear whether online reputation will have similar effects as in online retailing, where finished and standardized products are sold for consumption. We analyze field transaction data from a major online labor market. The analyses using matched contract samples and vendor panels consistently show that despite the governing power provided by contracts as well as the litigation and arbitration options, vendors’ online reputation can still be influential on clients. Vendors who have no reputation ratings are less likely to be chosen, and those with higher ratings are more likely to win subsequent bids. Importantly, however, such influences depend on the contract form that is used for a particular transaction—they are significant in output-based contracts but nonsignificant in input-based contracts. Besides extending the research on online reputation to the markets of customized production, this study shows contract form as an important boundary condition for the effectiveness of reputational information. It also provides direct managerial implications for electronic commerce in general and online labor markets in particular.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 5 Jan 2017
### Abstract:
We study platform design in online markets in which buying involves a (nonmonetary) cost for consumers caused by privacy and security concerns. Firms decide whether to require registration at their website before consumers learn relevant product information. We derive conditions under which a monopoly seller benefits from ex ante registration requirements and demonstrate that the profitability of registration requirements is increased when taking into account the prospect of future purchases or an informational value of consumer registration to the firm. Moreover, we consider the effectiveness of discounts (store credit) as a means to influence the consumers’ registration decision. Finally, we confirm the profitability of ex ante registration requirements in the presence of price competition.

## 23. Sharing Aggregate Inventory Information with Customers: Strategic Cross-Selling and Shortage Reduction
### Author(s):
- Ruomeng Cui
- Hyoduk Shin
### Published:
- 7 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
This paper studies the strategy of sharing inventory information for a firm that sells two vertically differentiated products. The seller has private information on the aggregate inventory level and the inventory composition of two product variants. The seller credibly and discretionarily discloses inventory information to customers either fully or partially, i.e., disclosing the exact inventory of each product variant, the aggregate inventory level, or no information to customers. Customers form expectations of future availability and make rational purchasing decisions accordingly. In the disclosure literature, discretion usually leads to an unraveling result: sellers who learn favorable market information opt to disclose it, making full disclosure the equilibrium. This paper shows that aggregate inventory disclosure, i.e., partial disclosure, can be instead sustained as an ex post equilibrium. We demonstrate that inventory information aggregation arises when there is an ex post desire to reduce supply–demand mismatches in all inventory scenarios. Specifically, when customers’ preferred products are more likely to stock out, the seller could entice more incoming consumers who hope that their desired products are in stock by withholding product composition but disclosing the aggregate inventory level. If customers’ desired products are sold out, the seller can benefit from upselling or cross-selling customers’ less preferred products. Alternatively, when the seller stocks more desired products, aggregate disclosure can dampen the flow of incoming customers and reduce the shortage penalty cost. This result is robust under various settings: risk-averse customers, heterogeneous customers, and horizontally differentiated products.

## 24. Making Sense of (Ultra) Low-Cost Flights Vertical Differentiation in Two-Sided Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Dec 2016
### Abstract:
The business model of low-cost carriers is now well established and accounts for a large share of Western civil aviation, particularly in Europe. To understand why it has proven so successful, we develop a theoretical model that exploits the two-sided nature of flights as connectors of supply and demand for goods and services other than traveling itself across physical space. Carriers offer flights of different quality and may sign agreements with suppliers of goods and services at the destination so as to subsidize and foster demand from the carriers’ travelers as in standard two-sided markets. Customers/travelers care about home and destination consumption and about the flight’s quality. Hence, beyond the thickness of the connected sides of the market, the quality of the airline platform has an intrinsic value to travelers. We show that only low-income travelers fly with low-cost airlines, while no-frills carriers are more likely to act as a platform than legacy airlines. We study how the degree of substitution between home and destination consumption affects the equilibrium market structure of the airline industry.

## 25. Multiattribute Loss Aversion and Reference Dependence: Evidence from the Performing Arts Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
We study the prevalence of multiattribute loss aversion and reference effects in a revenue management setting based on data of individual-level purchases over a series of concert performances. The reference dependence that drives consumer choice is not only based on the price but also on observed sales (as a fraction of the seating capacity) during their past visits. We find that consumers suffer from loss aversion on both prices and seats sold: consumers incur significant utility loss when prices are above their references or when the actual seat sales are lower than their references. We suggest pricing policies that can address consumer decisions driven by such reference dependence and loss aversion.

## 26. Asymptotic Optimality of Tailored Base-Surge Policies in Dual-Sourcing Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Linwei Xin
- David A. Goldberg
### Published:
- 7 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
Dual-sourcing inventory systems, in which one supplier is faster (i.e., express) and more costly, while the other is slower (i.e., regular) and cheaper, arise naturally in many real-world supply chains. These systems are notoriously difficult to optimize because of the complex structure of the optimal solution and the curse of dimensionality, having resisted solution for over 40 years. Recently, so-called tailored base-surge (TBS) policies have been proposed as a heuristic for the dual-sourcing problem. Under such a policy, a constant order is placed at the regular source in each period, while the order placed at the express source follows a simple order-up-to rule. Numerical experiments by several authors have suggested that such policies perform well as the lead time difference between the two sources grows large, which is exactly the setting in which the curse of dimensionality leads to the problem becoming intractable. However, providing a theoretical foundation for this phenomenon has remained a major open problem. In this paper, we provide such a theoretical foundation by proving that a simple TBS policy is indeed asymptotically optimal as the lead time of the regular source grows large, with the lead time of the express source held fixed. Our main proof technique combines novel convexity and lower-bounding arguments, an explicit implementation of the vanishing discount factor approach to analyzing infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and ideas from the theory of random walks and queues, significantly extending the methodology and applicability of a novel framework for analyzing inventory models with large lead times recently introduced by Goldberg and coauthors in the context of lost-sales models with positive lead times.

### Published:
- 10 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
Using behavioral experiments, we study the impact of queue design on worker productivity in service systems that involve human servers. Specifically, we consider two queue design features: queue structure, which can be either parallel queues (multiple queues with a dedicated server per queue) or a single queue (a pooled queue served by multiple servers), and queue-length visibility, which can provide either full or blocked visibility. We find that (1) the single-queue structure slows down the servers, illustrating a drawback of pooling, and (2) poor visibility of the queue length slows down the servers; however, this effect may be mitigated, or even reversed, by pay schemes that incentivize the servers for fast performance. We provide additional managerial insights by isolating two behavioral drivers behind these results—task interdependence and saliency of feedback.

## 28. Information Sharing, Advice Provision, or Delegation: What Leads to Higher Trust and Trustworthiness?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 23 Jan 2017
### Abstract:
In many market settings, a customer often obtains assistance from a supplier (or service provider) to make better-informed decisions regarding the supplier’s product (or service). Because the two parties often have conflicting pecuniary incentives, customer trust and supplier trustworthiness play important roles in the success of these interactions. We investigate whether and how the process through which assistance is provided can foster trust and trustworthiness, and thus facilitate better cooperation. We compare three prevalent assistance processes: information sharing, advice provision, and delegation. We propose that, even if the pecuniary incentives of both parties do not vary from one assistance process to another, the assistance process itself impacts the customer’s and supplier’s nonpecuniary motives that give rise to trust and trustworthiness. Consequently, the assistance process affects the level of cooperation and payoffs. We test our behavioral predictions through laboratory experiments based on a retail distribution setting. We quantify the impact of different assistance processes on trust, trustworthiness and channel performance, and identify the underlying drivers of those impacts. Our results offer insight into the role of the assistance process in managing supplier assistance effectively and why certain assistance processes may lead to more successful outcomes than others even if the pecuniary incentives remain unaltered.
