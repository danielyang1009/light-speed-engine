### Abstract:
We study how digital service firms can develop an active customer base, focusing on two questions. First, how does the way that customers use the service postadoption to meet their own needs (personal usage) and to interact with one another (social usage) vary across customer acquisition methods? Second, how do firm-to-customer and customer-to-customer communications promote different types of usage? We study these questions using two data sets and by developing a multivariate hierarchical Poisson hidden Markov model (HMM), which fits the data significantly better than univariate and latent class approaches. We indeed find that postadoption behavior varies depending on customer acquisition method and dynamic states. At the total usage level, in one context (an annotation and note-taking service), customers who heard about the service through search and mass-invite exhibited significantly higher usage compared to those who joined through word of mouth (WOM), whereas in another context (a cloud-based file storage service), customers who joined through WOM referrals tended to exhibit higher usage. Yet, examining how routes of adoption relate to specific types of behavior, personal versus social usages, reveals a more nuanced picture. Furthermore, in both contexts, communications postadoption influenced engagement, albeit in different ways. Firm-to-customer communications, through company posts to Twitter and blog entries, had varying effects on customer behavior and in some cases led to lower personal and/or social usage; however, customer-to-customer communications tended to increase personal-use engagement across latent states and in both data sets. The findings suggest that firms offering digital services should pay attention to how the mode of customer acquisition is related to subsequent usage intensity, accounting for both personal and social activity, and encourage customers to interact with each other postadoption.

## 2. Competition-Based Dynamic Pricing in Online Retailing: A Methodology Validated with Field Experiments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
A retailer following a competition-based dynamic-pricing strategy tracks competitors’ price changes and then must answer the following questions: (i) Should we respond? (ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer’s own and competitors’ stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors’ prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that lasts five weeks. The experiment documents an 11% revenue increase while maintaining a margin above a retailer-specified target.

## 3. The Spillover Effects of Health IT Investments on Regional Healthcare Costs

### Published:
- 30 May 2017
### Abstract:
Electronic health records (EHR) are often presumed to reduce the significant and accelerating healthcare costs in the United States. However, evidence on the relationship between EHR adoption and costs is mixed, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of EHR in decreasing costs. We argue that simply looking at the hospital-level effects can be misleading because the benefits of EHR can go beyond the adopting hospital by creating regional spillovers via information and patient sharing. When patients move between hospitals, timely and high-quality records received at one hospital can affect the costs of care at another hospital. We provide evidence that although EHR adoption increases the costs of the adopting hospital, it has significant spillover effects by reducing the costs of neighboring hospitals. We further show that these spillovers are linked to information and patient sharing. Specifically, the spillovers are stronger when more hospitals in the region are in health information exchange networks and in the same integrated delivery systems, which can share information more easily. Furthermore, utilizing regional characteristics that can affect the extent of patient sharing such as urban versus rural areas, population density, average distance between hospitals, and hospital density, we find that locations with higher patient and hospital concentration experience stronger regional spillovers. Additionally, spillovers are stronger after the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act that increased EHR adoption and use. Overall, our findings suggest that we need to take into account externalities to understand the benefits of health IT investments and form policy decisions.

## 4. Promoting Change from the Outside: Directing Managerial Attention in the Implementation of Environmental Improvements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
Regulatory agencies, auditing firms, and supply chain partners externally promote change in firms. To this end, they commonly employ two different and somewhat contradictory intervention approaches. One approach uses punitive tactics to coerce firms to change, while the other approach uses supportive tactics to encourage change. Using the context of government agencies promoting environmental improvements in firms, we examine whether such punitive (e.g., regulatory inspections with possible sanctions) and supportive (e.g., environmental assistance, improvement recommendations) tactics can be administered in a complementary manner. Using a unique and novel longitudinal data set collected from two state-level environmental agencies in Minnesota, we analyze over 1,000 supportive environmental improvement (EI) projects in combination with intermittent (but currently uncoordinated) punitive tactics. One key finding from our research is that the timing, severity, and relatedness of punitive tactics is critical for directing managerial attention and thus improving the efficacy of supportive tactics (i.e., EI implementation). Contingent on their timing, inspections can increase EI implementation rates by up to 60% but can also reduce implementation rates by up to 50% compared with EIs in facilities that do not experience inspections. Classifying regulatory inspections as (1) either clean or adverse and (2) either related or unrelated allows us to further explain the influence of such punitive tactics on EI implementation. Finally, we provide evidence for a positive effect of successful EI implementation on long-term environmental compliance.

## 5. Can We Trust Online Physician Ratings? Evidence from Cardiac Surgeons in Florida
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
Despite heated debate about the pros and cons of online physician ratings, little systematic work has examined the correlation between physicians’ online ratings and their actual medical quality. Using the ratings of cardiac surgeons at RateMDs and the patient outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries in the 2013 Florida Hospital Inpatient Discharge Data, we investigate whether online ratings are informative about physicians’ medical quality. To account for potentially nonrandom matchings of patients of different severity levels to surgeons of different rating categories, we focus on patients who arrived through the emergency department and explicitly consider how observed and unobserved patient health conditions jointly affect the matching arrangements and surgical outcomes. Both reduced form and two-stage estimation results show that, compared with surgeons rated four stars or higher, or those without rating information, lower rated surgeons are associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates. Our findings suggest that online physician ratings could be a valuable information source for patients to learn about physician quality, at least for cardiac surgeons, a specialty for which treatment outcomes are relatively observable to patients and their family members.

## 6. What Motivates Buy-Side Analysts to Share Recommendations Online?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 May 2017
### Abstract:
We examine why buy-side analysts share investment ideas on SumZero.com, a private social networking website designed to facilitate interaction and information sharing among buy-side professionals. We explore labor market motivations for information sharing and document that analysts with strong incentives to build a reputation (i.e., those who did not attend a top 10 university and those employed at small funds) are significantly more likely to share recommendations. Our findings indicate that analysts who share ideas are more likely to change jobs and that the likelihood of employment change is positively related to the ratings provided by peers. We also document that analyst recommendations generate significant returns when they are posted on SumZero and that prices drift in the direction of the recommendation. Long-window returns are particularly strong for contrarian buy recommendations and for most sell recommendations. Overall, we show that buy-side analysts share valuable private information in an online social network and that this can be an effective reputation-building and job-seeking tool.

## 7. Variety and Experience: Learning and Forgetting in the Use of Surgical Devices

### Published:
- 2 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We use a unique, hand-collected data set to examine learning and forgetting in hip replacement surgery as a function of a surgeon’s experience with specific surgical device versions and the time between their repeat uses. We also develop a generalizable method to correct for the left censoring of device-version-specific experience variables that is a common problem in highly granular experience data, using maximum simulated likelihood estimation with simulation over unobservables conditional on observables. Even for experienced surgeons, the first use of certain device versions can result in at least a 32.4% increase in surgery duration, hurting quality and productivity. Furthermore, with the passage of time, surgeons can forget knowledge gained about the use of particular devices. For certain devices, when the time gap between repeat uses increases from its median to its 75th percentile, surgery duration increases by about 3.4%. The high productivity and quality costs associated with device variety suggest that the gain from a new device design needs to be large enough to compensate for the short-term disadvantages of starting up on a new learning curve and of increasing the chances of knowledge depreciation over time.

## 8. Optimal Marketing Strategies for the Acquisition and Retention of Service Subscribers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for a subscription service. The evolution over time of the number of subscribers is governed by a differential equation combining two processes—namely, a customer acquisition process and a customer attrition process. Assuming profit-maximization behavior of the firm, we use dynamic programming to optimize the customer equity and determine optimal customer relationship marketing expenditures. We implement an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations to estimate the model’s parameters using market data of two well-known companies in the telecommunications sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to model acquisition and retention efforts in the context of a diffusion model. By doing so, we extend the literature on product diffusion to services—that is, beyond its traditional area of durable (and occasionally nondurable) products. By the same token, we contribute to the literature on customer relationship marketing (CRM), where social interactions have been overlooked. Our analytical and numerical results provide a better understanding of the relationships among the optimal customer equity, the customer lifetime value, the prospect lifetime value, and the optimal acquisition and retention spending. Our model and estimation approach give the tools for assessing empirically the role of CRM spending, social interactions, and other factors in the service subscription dynamics. Our main empirical results are as follows: (i) CRM spending and external incentives have indeed a significant effect on acquisition and retention processes; (ii) the impact of CRM is market specific; (iii) compared with optimal levels, both firms underinvest in retention; and (iv) whereas we observe increasing spending in acquisition over time, the derived optimal policy recommends a decreasing level of spending over time.

## 9. Closing the Productivity Gap: Improving Worker Productivity Through Public Relative Performance Feedback and Validation of Best Practices

### Published:

### Abstract:
Public relative performance feedback (RPF) on an individual worker’s productivity metrics is used in various organizations with the hopes of improving worker productivity, but its effects are not well understood. We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9% improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers, which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing system-level performance, service quality, or worker attrition. Our results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.

## 10. Efficient Ignorance: Information Heterogeneity in a Queue
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
How would the growing prevalence of real-time delay information affect a service system? We consider a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and the service time follows an exponential distribution. There are two streams of customers, one informed about real-time delay and the other uninformed. The customers’ uninformed behavior may be due to information ignorance or rational behavior in the presence of an information fee. We characterize the equilibrium behavior of customers with information heterogeneity and investigate how the presence of a larger fraction of informed customers affects the system performance measures, i.e., throughput and social welfare. We show that the effects of growing information prevalence on system performance measures are determined by the equilibrium joining behavior of uninformed customers. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that throughput and social welfare can be unimodal in the fraction of informed customers. In other words, some amount of information heterogeneity in the population can lead to more efficient outcomes, in terms of the system throughput or social welfare, than information homogeneity. For example, under a very mild condition, throughput in a system with an offered load of 1 will always suffer if there are more than 58% of informed customers in the population. Moreover, it is shown that for an overloaded system with offered load sufficiently higher than 1, social welfare always reaches its maximum when some fraction of customers is uninformed of the congestion level in real time.

## 11. Contract Design by Service Providers with Private Effort
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We investigate the performance of two commonly used pricing schemes—hourly-rate contract and two-part tariff—in service environments where the buyer’s valuation is invisible to the service provider and the provider’s effort may not be visible to the buyer. In the private effort environment, we further distinguish between situations where the contract may be based on the outcome or on the effort reported by the provider. We show that under the two-part tariff, when effort is private, the provider can achieve the same profit as under public effort by contracting on reported effort and will be worse off by contracting on outcome. Under the hourly-rate contract, compared with the public effort case, the provider may be better or worse off in keeping effort private and contracting on the reported effort, and the trade-off is affected by the degree of outcome uncertainty in a nontrivial way. We find that a provider’s profits under an hourly-rate contract are as good as under a two-part tariff over a sizable parameter regime when contracting on reported effort.

## 12. The Operational Advantages of Threshold Discounting Offers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 5 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We study threshold discounting, or the practice of offering a discounted-price service if at least a prespecified number of customers signal interest in it, as pioneered by Groupon. We model a capacity-constrained firm, a random-sized population of strategic customers, a desirable hot period, and a less desirable slow period. Compared to a more traditional approach (slow period discounting or closure), threshold discounting has two operational advantages. First, the contingent discount temporally balances demand when the market for the service is large, and reduces supply of the service (preserving higher margins) when the market is small, allowing the firm to respond to the service’s unobserved market potential. Second, activation of the threshold discount signals the market state and the consequent service availability to strategic customers, inducing them into self-selecting the consumption period to one that improves the firm’s capacity utilization. Yet, threshold discounting can be harmful in situations with chronically low demand. In contrast with past work on strategic customers, their presence is advantageous to firms in our context. A calibrated numerical study shows that threshold discounting improves firm profits over a traditional approach by as much as 33% (7% on average).

## 13. Incentives in Contests with Heterogeneous Solvers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 May 2017
### Abstract:
In a contest in which solvers with heterogeneous expertise exert effort to develop solutions, a recent paper [Terwiesch C, Xu Y (2008) Innovation contests, open innovation, and multiagent problem solving. Management Sci. 54(9):1529–1543] argues that as more solvers enter the contest, every solver will reduce effort due to a lower probability of winning the contest. This paper corrects mistakes in this theory, and shows that there exist high-expertise solvers who may raise their effort in response to increased competition. This is because more entrants raise the expected best performance among other solvers, creating positive incentives for solvers to exert higher effort to win the contest. Because of this positive effect, we find that a free-entry open contest is more likely to be optimal to a contest organizer than what Terwiesch and Xu (2008) and other prior literature asserted.

## 14. Competitive Intensity and Its Two-Sided Effect on the Boundaries of Firm Performance
### Author(s):
- Joao Montez

### Published:
- 19 May 2017
### Abstract:
The new perspective emerging from strategy’s value-capture stream is that the effects of competition are twofold: competition for an agent bounds its performance from below, while that for its transaction partners bounds from above. Thus, assessing the intensity of competition on either side is essential to understanding firm performance. Yet, the literature provides no formal notion of “competitive intensity” with which to make such assessments. Rather, some authors use added value as their central analytic concept, others the core. Added value is simple but misses the crucial, for-an-agent side of competition. The core is theoretically complete but difficult to interpret and empirically intractable. This paper formalizes three, increasingly general notions of competitive intensity, all of which improve on added value while avoiding the complexity of the core. We analyze markets characterized by disjoint networks of agents (e.g., supply chains), providing several insights into competition and new tools for empirical work.

## 15. Online Auctions and Multichannel Retailing
### Author(s):
- Jason Kuruzovich

### Published:
- 15 May 2017
### Abstract:
The Internet enables sellers to offer products through multiple channels simultaneously. In particular, many sellers utilize online auctions in parallel to an offline channel in which they offer the item for a fixed price. Using search theory, we develop an analytical model for studying sellers’ pricing decisions and auction outcomes in the context of such multichannel retailing. Our analytical model provides a framework for studying how characteristics of the demand in an offline retail sales channel impact the seller’s optimal reserve price in the auction channel, the probability that an auction ends in a sale, the probability that an item is sold through the auction channel, and the auction expected sale price. We then utilize data from eBay Motors auctions and examine empirically how the quality of a sellers’ retail location impacts the seller’s auctions outcomes. The results of our empirical analysis match the predictions of the analytical model.

### Published:
- 20 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
We study the price-setting behavior in a competitive market for used cars and provide empirical evidence for coarse information processing. Based on detailed field data from one of Europe’s largest online marketplaces for automotive vehicles, we document systematic and sizable price discontinuities at salient car-age and mileage thresholds. The price difference between two otherwise identical cars across registration years (where one was first registered in January and the other in December of the previous year) is up to five times larger than that between two cars first registered in any two subsequent months within a registration year. A similar pattern can be observed in the mileage dimension at 10,000-km odometer marks, which is in line with earlier findings in the literature. Being able to study discontinuities along two dimensions of the same good allows us to further our understanding toward a more general notion of inattentive behavior. While our results are compatible with a behavioral model of limited attention, we also provide evidence for a more traditional explanation based on search frictions.

## 17. Offline Assortment Optimization in the Presence of an Online Channel
### Author(s):
- Daria Dzyabura
- Srikanth Jagabathula
### Published:
- 14 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
Firms are increasingly selling through both offline and online channels, allowing customers to experience the touch and feel of product attributes before purchasing those products. Consequently, the selection of products offered offline affects the demand in both channels. We address how firms should select an optimal offline assortment to maximize profits across both channels; we call this the showcase decision problem. We incorporate the impact of physical evaluation on preferences into the consumer demand model. Under this model, we show that the decision problem is NP-hard. Analytically, we derive optimal results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40% due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online sales.

## 18. Social Risk and the Dimensionality of Intentions
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey V. Butler

### Published:
- 23 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Previous research has documented a behavioral distinction between “social risk,” or risk caused by human factors, and natural risk. In particular, people tend to demand a premium on the probability of a favorable outcome in order to expose themselves to a social source of risk rather than a natural source of risk. Several explanations for what drives this social risk premium have been offered—most prominently, (i)an aversion to a counterparty’s potentially malign intentions and (ii) a more general aversion to ceding control to someone with conflicting interests. We propose that a fundamental determinant of the social risk premium may relate to a counterparty’s capacity to engage in intentional action. We employ a between-subjects experimental design in which we manipulate subjects’ capacity for intentional action. Our design allows us to identify the component of the social risk premium related to an aversion to betrayal, independent of any aversion to ceding control. Furthermore, our results show that intentions are a crucial determinant of the social risk premium. We identify factors that eliminate, and may even change the sign of, the social risk premium. Our results contribute to our understanding of the factors that influence the perception of social risk and have implications for optimal contract design in a wide variety of situations involving social risk.

## 19. How Do Prior Gains and Losses Affect Subsequent Risk Taking? New Evidence from Individual-Level Horse Race Bets
### Author(s):
- Niko Suhonen
- Jani Saastamoinen
### Published:
- 10 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Many empirical studies focusing on how prior outcomes affect subsequent risk taking report conclusions that appear mutually contradictory. While some studies document increased risk taking after gains and risk aversion after losses, others report the opposite. This paper contributes to this literature by investigating horse race bettors’ sequential risky decisions using individual-level data. A horse race betting market is a laboratory-like environment and can be used to analyze behavioral patterns associated with decision making under risk. We find evidence for (i) the “house money effect” as bettors take riskier wagers after gains and mostly spend the money they have won; (ii) risk aversion after prior losses, which we label a “playing safe effect”; and (iii) a preference for breakeven. Contrary to the widely held conception in the empirical literature, our findings suggest that the “break-even effect” does not necessarily imply an increased preference for riskier bets because bettors may seek to break even with less risky wagers.

### Published:

### Abstract:
A large strand of research has identified when (i) a single risk is undesirable and (ii) two independent risks aggravate each other. We extend this line of inquiry by establishing when (iii) mutual aggravation is greater for greater risks. This natural property of greater mutual aggravation explains recent experimental findings on higher-order risk preferences, and can guide managerial behavior when risks in the decision environment become more severe.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
First, this paper introduces and axiomatizes range-dependent utility as a new conceptual framework for decision making under risk. It is a simple and well-defined generalization of expected utility theory in which utility depends on the range of lottery outcomes. Second, a special case of this framework is proposed for prediction. It is based on applying a single utility function (decision utility) to every normalized lottery range. The resultant decision utility model predicts well-known expected utility paradoxes without recourse to probability weighting. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the model to satisfy monotonicity with respect to first-order stochastic dominance are identified. The typical decision utility function, which is confirmed by both experimental data and normative considerations, is S shaped.

### Published:
- 13 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
This study examines analyst information intermediary roles using a textual analysis of analyst reports and corporate disclosures. We employ a topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research to compare the thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings conference calls with the content of the calls themselves. We show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those from conference calls and interpret topics from conference calls. In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant information. Analyst interpretation is particularly valuable when the processing costs of conference call information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to analyst report content that simply confirms managers’ conference call discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate disclosures and by clarifying and confirming corporate disclosures.

## 23. Managerial Compensation in Multidivision Firms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Using hand-collected data on division manager (DM) pay contracts, we document that DM pay is related to the performance of both the DM’s division and the other divisions in the firm. There is substantial heterogeneity in DM pay for performance. DM pay for division performance is lower in industries with less informative accounting earnings. DM pay is more sensitive to other-division performance if the DM’s division is related to the rest of the firm, if the DM’s division has fewer growth opportunities, and if the DM’s division receives less capital from the rest of the firm. Consistent with optimal contracting view, DMs receive greater pay for other-division performance in better-governed firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that DM compensation is structured to account for the information and agency problems in multidivision firms.

## 24. Managing Performance Signals Through Delay: Evidence from Venture Capital
### Author(s):
- Indraneel Chakraborty
- Michael Ewens
### Published:
- 3 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether agency conflicts during venture capital (VC) fundraising impact investment behavior. Using novel investment-level decisions of VCs in the process of raising new funds, we find that venture capitalists take actions hidden from their investors—i.e., limited partners (LPs)—that delay revealing negative information about VC fund performance until after a new fund is raised. After fundraising is complete, write-offs double and reinvestments in relatively worse-off entrepreneurial firms increase. We find that these observations cannot be explained by strategic bundling of news or effort constraints due to the newly raised fund. Funds with both long and short fundraising track record exhibit this behavior and the delay is costly for fund investors (LPs). This strategic delay shows that fundraising incentives have real impacts on VC fund investment decisions, which are often difficult for LPs to observe.

- 22 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
We study the empirical relevance of the participation externality between liquidity suppliers (makers) and demanders (takers), i.e., whether liquidity demand attracts or reduces liquidity supply, and vice versa. We use exogenous shocks to exchange fees and technology as experiments to identify cross-sided complementarities between liquidity suppliers and demanders in the U.S. equity market. We find that the externality is large and positive, on average. However, the externality is negative in periods of high adverse selection.

### Abstract:
This paper investigates the role of institutional trading in the emergence of hedge fund activism—an important corporate governance mechanism. We demonstrate that institutional sales raise a firm’s probability of becoming an activist target. Furthermore, by exploiting the funding circumstances of individual institutions, we establish that such effects occur through a liquidity channel, i.e., the activist camouflages his purchases among other institutions’ liquidity sales. Additional evidence supports our conclusion. First, activist purchases closely track institutional sales at the daily frequency. Second, such synchronicity is stronger among targets with lower expected monitoring benefits, suggesting that gains from trading with other institutions supplement these benefits in the activist’s targeting decision. Finally, we find that institutional sales accelerate the timing of a campaign at firms already followed by activists rather than attract attention to unlikely targets. Taken together, our findings offer a novel empirical perspective on the liquidity theories of activism; while activists screen firms on the basis of fundamentals, they pick specific targets at a particular time by exploiting institutional liquidity shocks.

## 27. Outsourcing Corporate Governance: Conflicts of Interest Within the Proxy Advisory Industry

### Abstract:
Proxy advisory firms wield large influence with voting shareholders. However, conflicts of interest may arise when an advisor sells services to both investors and issuers. Using a unique data set on voting recommendations, I find that for most types of proposals, competition from a new entrant reduces favoritism toward management by an incumbent advisor that serves both corporations and investors. The results are not driven by factors that influence the entrant’s coverage decision, such as the marginal cost of new coverage or previously biased recommendations by the incumbent. Similar to other information intermediaries, biased advice by proxy advisors is shown to have real, negative consequences that allow management to enjoy greater private benefits. These results suggest conflicts of interest are a real concern in the proxy advisory industry, and increasing competition could help alleviate them.
