### Abstract:
Online labor marketplaces facilitate the efficient matching of employers and workers across geographical boundaries. The exponential growth of this nascent online phenomenon holds important social and economic implications, as the hiring decisions made on these online platforms implicate the incomes of millions of workers worldwide. Despite this importance, limited effort has been devoted to understanding whether potential hiring biases exist in online labor platforms and how they may affect hiring outcomes. Using a novel proprietary data set from a leading online labor platform, we investigate the impact of gender-based stereotypes on hiring outcomes. After accounting for endogeneity via a holistic set of job and worker controls, a matched sample approach, and a quasi-experimental technique, we find evidence of a positive hiring bias in favor of female workers. An experiment was used to uncover the underlying gender-specific traits that could influence hiring outcomes. We find that the observed hiring bias diminishes as employers gain more hiring experience on the platform. In addition, the female hiring bias appears to stem solely from the consideration of applicants from developing countries, and not those from developed countries. Subanalyses show that women are preferred in feminine-typed occupations while men do not enjoy higher hiring likelihoods in masculine-typed occupations. We also find that female employers are more susceptible to the female hiring bias compared to male employers. Our findings provide key insights for several groups of stakeholders including policy makers, platform owners, hiring managers, and workers. Managerial and practical implications are discussed.

### Abstract:
We study the optimal pricing problem of a monopolistic firm facing customers with limited attention and capability to process information about the value (quality) of a single offered product. We model customer choice based on the theory of rational inattention in the economics literature, which enables us to capture not only the impact of true quality and price, but also the intricate effects of customer’s prior beliefs and cost of information acquisition and processing. We formulate the firm’s price optimization problem assuming that the firm can also use the price to signal the quality of the product to customers. To delineate the economic incentives of the firm, we first characterize the pricing and revenue implications of customer’s limited attention without signaling, and then use these results to explore perfect Bayesian equilibria of the strategic pricing signaling game. As an extension, we consider heterogeneous customers with different information costs as well as prior beliefs. We discuss the managerial implications of our key findings and prescribe insights regarding information provision and product positioning.

## 3. Innovation, Openness, and Platform Control
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Suppose that a firm in charge of a business ecosystem is a firm in charge of a microeconomy. To achieve the highest growth rate, how open should that economy be? To encourage third-party developers, how long should their intellectual property interests last? We develop a sequential innovation model that addresses the trade-offs inherent in these two decisions: (i) Closing the platform increases the sponsor’s ability to charge for access, while opening the platform increases developer ability to build upon it. (ii) The longer third-party developers retain rights to their innovations, the higher the royalties they and the sponsor earn, but the sooner those developers’ rights expire, the sooner their innovations become a public good upon which other developers can build. Our model allows us to characterize the optimal levels of openness and of intellectual property (IP) duration in a platform ecosystem. We use standard Cobb–Douglas production technologies to derive our results. These findings can inform innovation strategy, choice of organizational form, IP noncompete decisions, and regulation policy.

## 4. When More Is Less: Field Evidence on Unintended Consequences of Multitasking

### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
Online customer service chats provide new opportunities for firms to interact with their customers and have become increasingly popular in recent years for firms of all sizes. One reason for their popularity is the ability for customer service agents to multitask (i.e., interact with multiple customers at a time) thereby increasing the system “throughput” and agent productivity. Yet little is known about how multitasking impacts customer satisfaction—the ultimate goal of customer engagements. We address this question using a proprietary data set from an S&P 500 service firm that documents agent multitasking activities (unobservable to customers) in the form of server logs, customer service chat transcripts, and postservice customer surveys. We find that agent multitasking leads to longer in-service delays for customers and lower problem resolution rates. Both lead to lower customer satisfaction, although the impact varies for different customers. Our study is among the first to document the link between multitasking and customer satisfaction, and it has implications for the design of agent time allocation in contact centers and more broadly for how firms can best manage customer relations in new service channels enabled by information technology.

## 5. Impact of Queue Configuration on Service Time: Evidence from a Supermarket
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
We study how queue configuration affects human servers’ service time by comparing dedicated queues with shared queues using field data from a natural experiment in a supermarket. We hypothesize that queue configuration may affect servers’ service rate through several mechanisms: pooling may affect service rate directly as a result of social loafing effect and competition effect and indirectly via its impact on queue length. To investigate these impacts, we take advantage of the supermarket’s checkout layout and use a data set containing both checkout transaction details and queue information collected from video recordings in the supermarket. After we control for the queue length, we find that servers in dedicated queues are about 10.7% faster than those in shared queues, mainly because of the social loafing effect. We also demonstrate that pooling has an indirect negative effect on service time through its impact on queue length. In addition, the queue configuration’s direct effect and its indirect queue length effect function independently of each other. In aggregation, the social loafing effect dominates, and servers slow down (a 6.86% increase in service time) in shared queues.

## 6. Competitive Strategies for Brick-and-Mortar Stores to Counter “Showrooming”
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
Customers often evaluate products at brick-and-mortar stores to identify their “best-fit” product but buy it for a lower price at a competing online retailer. This free-riding behavior by customers is referred to as “showrooming,” and we show that this is detrimental to the profits of the brick-and-mortar stores. We first analyze price matching as a short-term strategy to counter showrooming. Price matching allows customers to purchase a product from the store for less than the store’s posted price, so one would expect the price matching strategy to be less effective as the fraction of customers who seek the matching increases. However, our results show that with an increase in the fraction of customers who seek price matching, the store’s profits initially decrease and then increase. While price matching could be used even when customers do not exhibit showrooming behavior, we find that it is more effective when customers do showrooming. We then study exclusivity of product assortments as a long-term strategy to counter showrooming. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (1) by arranging for exclusivity of known brands (e.g., Macy’s has such an arrangement with Tommy Hilfiger) or (2) through the creation of store brands at the brick-and-mortar store (T. J. Maxx sells a large number of store brands). Our analysis suggests that implementing exclusivity through store brands is better than exclusivity through known brands when the product category has few digital attributes. However, when customers do not showroom, the known-brand strategy dominates the store-brand strategy.

## 7. Does Copyright Affect Reuse? Evidence from Google Books and Wikipedia
### Author(s):
- Abhishek Nagaraj
### Published:
- 26 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
While digitization has greatly increased the reuse of knowledge, this study shows how these benefits might be mitigated by copyright restrictions. I use the digitization of in-copyright and out-of-copyright issues of Baseball Digest magazine by Google Books to measure the impact of copyright on knowledge reuse in Wikipedia. I exploit a feature of the 1909 Copyright Act whereby material published before 1964 has lapsed into the public domain, allowing for the causal estimation of the impact of copyright across this sharp cutoff. I find that, while digitization encourages knowledge reuse, copyright restrictions reduce citations to copyrighted issues of Baseball Digest by up to 135% and affect readership by reducing traffic to affected pages by 20%. These impacts are highly uneven: copyright hurts the reuse of images rather than text and affects Wikipedia pages for less-popular players greater than more-popular ones.

## 8. Shareholder Protection and Agency Costs: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
Two competing principal–agent models explain why firms pay dividends. The substitute model proposes that corporate insiders pay dividends to signal and build trust with outside shareholders who lack legal protection. The outcome model, in contrast, surmises that when shareholders have legal protection, they demand dividends from insiders to prevent them from expropriating corporate funds. Either way, dividends represent an agency cost paid to align the interests of shareholders and insiders. Expropriations by insiders and reduced investment by shareholders are also agency costs, but they are difficult to identify with archival data. Using a laboratory experiment, we identify the impact of strengthened shareholder protection on all three types of agency costs. Dividend payout ratios are five times larger with stronger investor protection, insider expropriation ratios are twice as high, and outsider investment falls by 45%. Thus, we find evidence that strengthening shareholder protection introduces previously unidentified agency costs into the insider–investor relationship.

## 9. The Value of “Bespoke”: Demand Learning, Preference Learning, and Customer Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
“Bespoke,” or mass customization strategy, combines demand learning and preference learning. We develop an analytical framework to study the economic value of bespoke systems and investigate the interaction between demand learning and preference learning. We find that it is possible for demand learning and preference learning to be either complements or substitutes, depending on the customization cost and the demand uncertainty profile. They are generally complements when the personalization cost is low and the probability of having high demand is large. Contrary to usual belief, we show that higher demand uncertainty does not necessarily yield more complementarity benefits. Our numerical study shows that the complementarity benefit becomes weaker when customers are more strategic. Interestingly, the substitute loss can occur when the personalization cost is small and the probability of having high demand is large, when customers are strategic.

## 10. Asymmetry and Ambiguity in Newsvendor Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
A basic assumption of the classical newsvendor model is that the probability distribution of the random demand is known. But in most realistic settings, only partial distribution information is available or reliably estimated. The distributionally robust newsvendor model is often used in this case where the worst-case expected profit is maximized over the set of distributions satisfying the known information, which is usually the mean and covariance of demands. However, covariance does not capture information on asymmetry of the demand distribution. In this paper, we introduce a measure of distribution asymmetry using second-order partitioned statistics. Semivariance is a special case with a single partition of the univariate demand. With mean, variance, and semivariance information, we show that a three-point distribution achieves the worst-case expected profit and derive a closed-form expression for the distributionally robust order quantity. For multivariate demand, the distributionally robust problem with partitioned statistics is hard to solve, but we develop a computationally tractable lower bound through the solution of a semidefinite program. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that asymmetry information significantly reduces expected profit loss particularly when the true distribution is heavy tailed. In computational experiments on automotive spare parts demand data, we provide evidence that the distributionally robust model that includes partitioned statistics outperforms the model that uses only covariance information.

## 11. Are All Spillovers Created Equal? A Network Perspective on Information Technology Labor Movements
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
This study examines how characteristics of an interfirm labor-flow network affect firm productivity. Using employee job histories to trace labor movement between organizations, we construct labor-flow networks for both information technology (IT) and non-IT labor and analyze how a firm’s network structure for the two types of labor affects its performance. We find that hiring IT workers from a structurally diverse network of firms can substantially improve firm productivity, but that the same is not true for non-IT labor, where we find little benefit of network diversity. We hypothesize that these results reflect differences in the types of knowledge diffusion facilitated by different types of labor flows, with IT labor enabling the transfer of new and innovative firm practices, which benefits from diversity, while non-IT labor flows are more closely associated with implementation of complementary organizational practices, which may benefit from a critical mass of workers with a common knowledge base. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of incorporating a network perspective in understanding the full impact of spillover effects from organizational hiring activities.

## 12. Dynamic Quality Ladder Model Predictions in Nonrandom Holdout Samples
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
In light of recent calls for further validation of structural models, this paper evaluates the popular dynamic quality ladder (DQL) model using a nonrandom holdout approach. The model is used to predict data following a regime shift—that is, a change in the environment that produced the estimation data. The prediction performance is evaluated relative to a benchmark vector autoregression (VAR) model across three automotive categories and multiple prediction horizons. Whereas the VAR model performs better in all scenarios in the compact car category, the DQL model tends to perform better on multiple-year horizons in both the midsize car and full-size pickup categories. A supplementary data analysis suggests that DQL model performance in the nonrandom holdout prediction task is better in categories that are more affected by the regime shift, helping to validate the usefulness of the dynamic structural model for making predictions after policy changes.

## 13. Pricing of Conditional Upgrades in the Presence of Strategic Consumers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study a conditional upgrade strategy that has recently emerged in the travel industry. After a consumer makes a reservation for a product (e.g., a hotel room), she is asked whether she would like to upgrade her product to a higher-quality (more expensive) one at a discounted price. The upgrade, however, is not fulfilled immediately. The firm fulfills upgrades at check-in if higher-quality products are still available, and the upgrade fee is charged to the consumer if and only if she actually gets upgraded. Consumers decide which product type to book and whether to accept an upgrade offer or not based on the anticipated upgrade probability. We find that conditional upgrades create value by improving demand–supply matching for the firm. The firm can use the conditional upgrade channel to flexibly manage capacity allocations and reoptimize demand segmentation. For a firm that takes product prices as given, offering conditional upgrades is effective in compensating for the firm’s lack of ability in setting prices optimally. For a firm that has the ability to optimize product prices, conditional upgrades generate higher revenues than dynamic pricing.

## 14. The Rich Domain of Ambiguity Explored
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
Ellsberg and others suggested that decision under ambiguity is a rich empirical domain with many phenomena to be investigated beyond the Ellsberg urns. We provide a systematic empirical investigation of this richness by varying the uncertain events, the outcomes, and combinations of both. Although ambiguity aversion is prevailing, we also find systematic ambiguity seeking, confirming insensitivity. We find that ambiguity attitudes depend on the kind of uncertainty (the source) but not on the kind of outcomes. Ambiguity attitudes are closer to rationality (ambiguity neutrality) for natural uncertainties than for artificial Ellsberg urn uncertainties. This also appears from the reductions of monotonicity violations and of insensitivity. Ambiguity attitudes have predictive power across different outcomes and sources of uncertainty, with individual-specific components. Our rich domain serves well to test families of weighting functions for fitting ambiguity attitudes. We find that two-parameter families, capturing not only aversion but also insensitivity, are desirable for ambiguity even more than for risk. The Goldstein–Einhorn family performed best for ambiguity.

### Published:
- 12 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
Theory and recent empirical literature suggest that social and professional connections may influence corporate policy. However, inference may be biased by the possibility that firms who share peers also share unobserved characteristics that are correlated with observed policy. Using a novel identification strategy, we predict and find that director connections through well-known island tax havens have a significant effect on corporate tax policy. Specifically, we find that U.S. firms with directors who are connected to firms domiciled on the islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, or the Caymans exhibit significantly greater tax avoidance than other U.S. firms. The presence or arrival of an island director is associated with a reduction of between one and three percentage points in the firm’s effective tax rate. We also observe a significant increase in the use of tax haven subsidiaries following the arrival of the island director.

## 16. The Colorblind Crowd? Founder Race and Performance in Crowdfunding
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 May 2017
### Abstract:
The dearth of minority entrepreneurs has received increasing media attention but few academic analyses. In particular, the funding process creates challenges for either audit or correspondence methods, making it difficult to assess the role, or type, of discrimination influencing resource providers. We use a novel approach that combines analyses of 7,617 crowdfunding projects with an experimental design to identify whether African American men are discriminated against and whether this reflects statistical, taste-based, or unconscious bias on the part of prospective supporters. We find that African American men are significantly less likely than similar white founders to receive funding and that prospective supporters rate identical projects as lower in quality when they believe the founder is an African American male. We conclude that the reduction in perceived quality does not reflect conscious assumptions of differences in founder ability or disamenity but rather an unconscious assumption that black founders are lower quality. In two additional experiments, we identify three means of reducing this bias: through additional evidence of quality via third-party endorsements (i.e., awards, evidence of prior support), through evidence that African American founders have succeeded previously, and by removing indicators of the founder’s race.

## 17. Liquidity Provision and the Cross Section of Hedge Fund Returns
### Author(s):
- Russell Jame
### Published:
- 29 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
I investigate whether hedge funds that supply liquidity earn superior returns. Using transaction data, I find that hedge funds following short-term contrarian strategies (i.e., liquidity suppliers) earn significantly higher returns on their equity trades and holdings. Similarly, using commercial databases, I find that hedge funds with greater exposure to a liquidity provision factor earn significantly higher excess returns and Sharpe ratios. The superior performance of liquidity-supplying hedge funds arises from strategies that are more complex than mechanical short-term reversal strategies. For example, among stocks with similar past returns, liquidity-supplying funds are more likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by constrained mutual funds and less likely to trade against stocks heavily traded by unconstrained mutual funds. The outperformance of liquidity-supplying funds is also concentrated in periods of low funding liquidity, suggesting that less-binding financial constraints contribute to their superior returns.

## 18. Millennial-Style Learning: Search Intensity, Decision Making, and Information Sharing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
The growing use of online educational content and related video services has changed the way people access education, share knowledge, and possibly make life decisions. In this paper, we characterize how video content affects individual decision making and willingness to share in the context of a personal financial decision. We find that distracting advertising curtails the time people invest in searching for the best alternative and causes worse decisions. Content geared toward giving better instructions helps to overcome this effect. Such actionable content improves both search quality and financial decisions. However, including such content may decrease sharing unless it is perceived to be sufficiently useful. As such, there is a potential risk to adding actionable content to videos. Our work has important implications for policies guiding financial literacy training, and it also has broader impact for education in the information age.

## 19. Can Prospect Theory Explain the Disposition Effect? A New Perspective on Reference Points
### Author(s):
- Juanjuan Meng
- Xi Weng
### Published:
- 24 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
There has been recent debate about whether prospect theory can explain the disposition effect. Using both theory and simulation, this paper shows that prospect theory often predicts the disposition effect when lagged expected final wealth is the reference point under the principle of preferred personal equilibrium, regardless of whether the reference point is updated or not. When initial wealth is the reference point, however, there is often no disposition effect. Models that use a reference point with no lag under the principle of preferred personal equilibrium or that determine the reference point using the principle of disappointment aversion cannot explain why the investor bought a stock in the first place. Reference point adjustment weakens the disposition effect, leads to more aggressive initial stock purchase strategies, and predicts history dependence in stock holding.

### Abstract:
Evolutionary explanations of anger as a commitment device hinge on two key assumptions. The first is that it is predictable, ex ante, whether someone will get angry when feeling that he or she has been badly treated. The second is that anger is associated with destructive behavior. We test the validity of these two assumptions. We collected photos of responders in an ultimatum game before they were informed about the game that they would be playing, and we filmed responders with webcams during play. We then showed pairs of photos consisting of one responder who rejected and one responder who accepted (a low offer) to an independent group of observers. We find that observers are better than chance at detecting who rejected the low offer; they do 10% better than random guessing would. We also find that anger at receiving a low offer is associated with rejection.

## 21. Temporary Incentives Change Daily Routines: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Singapore’s Subways
### Author(s):
- Nan Yang
- Yong Long Lim
### Published:
- 9 May 2017
### Abstract:
We show that temporary incentives can lead to lasting changes in people’s daily routines through a field experiment. In randomized controlled trials on Singapore’s subways, commuters in the treatment group received a full rebate of their fares for 10 weeks if they exited fare gates before the start of morning peak-travel time. The objective of the fare promotion was to alleviate peak-time congestion by encouraging commuters to travel prepeak. This promotion resembles an actual public program implemented in Singapore in 2013. Using participants’ fare cards, we obtained a rich data set for 60 weeks’ worth of trips. A difference-in-differences analysis reveals that the effect of the free-trip offer was modest but robust during the promotional period: on average, trips were 5.5% more likely to end before the morning peak time. More encouragingly, the modest shift toward early travel strongly persisted even seven months after the end of the free-trip offer. This seemingly small shift could imply large financial savings on infrastructure investment. We find suggestive evidence that travel regularity and consistency during the promotion appear to be important for forging persistence.

## 22. Communication, Incentives, and the Execution of a Strategic Initiative
### Author(s):
- Jeremy Hutchison-Krupat
### Published:
- 2 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
Senior leadership has two primary levers to influence a direct report: incentives and communication. Financial incentives are credible and precisely specified but offer limited flexibility. In contrast, communication is flexible but lacks precision, and must be deemed credible to affect a direct report’s actions. We study a setting where senior leadership seeks to add a new initiative to their organization’s portfolio. The initiative’s potential to create value is not initially well understood. Senior leadership eventually obtains more precise information on the initiative’s value and subsequently may communicate this information to their direct report. We analyze senior leadership’s incentive and communication decisions, and ultimately their portfolio decision. We find that senior leadership’s communication only affects a direct report’s actions when a new initiative’s potential to create value is sufficiently uncertain. Additionally, we find instances where an organization may benefit from communication that offers lessspecificity.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We examine the determinants and consequences of voting outcomes in uncontested director elections. Exploiting a unique hand-collected data set of the rationale behind proxy advisors’ recommendations—the primary driver of voting outcomes—we document the director and board characteristics on which voting shareholders focus (as well as those that they neglect), their evolution over time, and their relative importance. Absent a negative recommendation, high votes withheld are infrequent, highlighting the agenda-setting role of proxy advisors. While high votes withheld rarely result in director turnover, our analyses show that firms often respond to an adverse vote by explicitly addressing the underlying concern. Overall, it appears that shareholders use their votes in uncontested director elections to get directors to address specific problems, rather than to vote them onto or off of the board, but they do so only on matters highlighted by the proxy advisors.

### Published:
- 11 Jul 2017
### Abstract:
It is widely believed that a little flexibility added at the right place can reap significant benefits for operations. Unfortunately, despite the extensive literature on this topic, we are not aware of any general methodology that can be used to guide managers in designing sparse (i.e., slightly flexible) and yet efficient operations. We address this issue using a distributionally robust approach to model the performance of a stochastic system under different process structures. We use the dual prices obtained from a related conic program to guide managers in the design process. This leads to a general solution methodology for the construction of efficient sparse structures for several classes of operational problems. Our approach can be used to design simple yet efficient structures for workforce deployment and for any level of sparsity requirement, to respond to deviations and disruptions in the operational environment. Furthermore, in the case of the classical process flexibility problem, our methodology can recover the k-chain structures that are known to be extremely efficient for this type of problem when the system is balanced and symmetric. We can also obtain the analog of 2-chain for nonsymmetrical system using this methodology.

## 25. Should Intangible Investments Be Reported Separately or Commingled with Operating Expenses? New Evidence
### Author(s):
- Luminita Enache

### Published:
- 28 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We propose a new method to estimate intangible investment outlays, other than expenditures on advertising and research and development, that are reported on a commingled basis with operating expenses in the selling, general, and administrative category of expenses. These outlays, aimed at improving organizational knowledge and capabilities, are the largest category of intangible investments and the fastest-growing category of operating investments. They affect future firm performance and risk. Predictability of future earnings and stock returns improves when these outlays are distinguished from operating expenses. Thus, benefits could accrue from reporting them separately.
