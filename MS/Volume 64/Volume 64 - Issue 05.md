### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper examines patient preferences and choice behavior in scheduling medical appointments. We conduct four discrete choice experiments on two distinct populations and identify several “operational” attributes (e.g., delay to care and choice of doctor) that affect patient choice. We observe an interesting gender effect with respect to how patients trade off speed (delay to care) and quality (doctor of choice), and demonstrate that risk attitudes mediate the impact of gender on the perception of speed and quality. Specifically, females (versus males) are more averse to not seeing their own doctor, and, when delay to care is relatively long, females perceive greater utility loss than males. As many operational strategies in outpatient care aim to improve the patient experience by making trade-offs between speed and quality, we make suggestions for when managers should intervene to improve their practice and how such interventions might look based on the patient mix and current delay level.

## 2. Are Immigrants Complements or Substitutes? Evidence from the Audit Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Extensive debate exists among policy makers and economists about the employment of highly skilled immigrants in the United States. It remains unclear whether these immigrants perform complementary tasks in addition to their substitutive role relative to native graduates. Empirical studies examining these questions in a focused setting are scarce, principally because of the nonavailability of data. We examine these questions using the audit industry as a setting because of the availability of client, city, and office characteristic data at each audit office. This setting also allows us to answer whether immigration can address the growing human capital constraint in the audit industry. We find evidence of a complementary role of highly skilled immigrants. In addition, our results indicate a reputational spillover of client restatements at the audit office level to the labor markets. Our findings have immigration and education policy implications.

## 3. We’re Number 1: Price Wars for Market Share Leadership
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 9 May 2017
### Abstract:
I examine the dynamics of oligopolies when firms derive subjective value from market leadership. In equilibrium, prices alternate in tandem between high levels and occasional price wars, which take place when market leadership is at stake. The stationary distribution of market shares is typically multimodal; that is, much of the time, there is a stable market leader. Even though shareholders do not value market leadership per se, a corporate culture that values market leadership may increase shareholder value.

## 4. Revenue-Maximizing Mechanisms with Strategic Customers and Unknown, Markovian Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
We show that appropriate dynamic pricing strategies can be used to draw benefits from the presence of consumers who strategically time their purchase even if the arrival process is not known. In our model, a seller sells a stock of objects to a stream of randomly arriving long-lived agents. Agents are privately informed about their values, and about their arrival time to the market. The seller needs to learn about future demand from past arrivals. We characterize the revenue-maximizing direct mechanism. While the optimal mechanism cannot be reduced to posted prices (and requires personalized prices), we also present a simple, “learn and then sell” mechanism that is able to extract a large fraction of the maximal revenue. In this mechanism, the seller first charges a relatively low price that allows learning about the arrival process, and in a second stage, the seller charges the optimal posted price given the previously obtained information.

## 5. Behavior-Based Advertising
### Author(s):
- Qiaowei Shen

### Published:
- 11 May 2017
### Abstract:
This paper considers the effect of firms sending advertising messages to consumers based on their past purchase behavior. If past purchase behavior on a product category is positively correlated with a consumer having high preferences in another category, a firm may want to advertise more intensively to those consumers that purchased the former category, if possible. This paper finds that this can lead to lower prices in the initial category if the annoyance of receiving advertising is large, and to higher prices if the annoyance of receiving advertising is not too large, as consumers expect a possible additional surplus from the category affected by behavior-based advertising. If receiving advertising does not yield too much annoyance to consumers, firms end up better off due to both higher prices and the increased demand of better matching of advertising. Behavior-based advertising may also lead firms to sell less in the initial category than without behavior-based advertising, as a way to be able to better target the most valuable consumers. If the consumer annoyance of receiving advertising is large, firms may end up serving only a few consumers initially, as attracting more consumers requires prices that are too low, and the initial consumers are attracted because of the possibility of lower prices in the following period. The paper also investigates the effects of joint behavior-based pricing and advertising, and of different firms benefiting from the purchase information.

## 6. Stimulating Online Reviews by Combining Financial Incentives and Social Norms

### Published:
- 3 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
In hopes of motivating consumers to provide larger volumes of useful reviews, many retailers offer financial incentives. Here, we explore an alternative approach, social norms. We inform individuals about the volume of reviews authored by peers. We test the effectiveness of using financial incentives, social norms, and a combination of both strategies in motivating consumers. In two randomized experiments, one in the field conducted in partnership with a large online clothing retailer based in China and a second on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we compare the effectiveness of each strategy in stimulating online reviews in larger numbers and of greater length. We find that financial incentives are more effective at inducing larger volumes of reviews, but the reviews that result are not particularly lengthy, whereas social norms have a greater effect on the length of reviews. Importantly, we show that the combination of financial incentives and social norms yields the greatest overall benefit by motivating reviews in greater numbers and of greater length. We further assess treatment-induced self-selection and sentiment bias by triangulating the experimental results with findings from an observational study.

### Abstract:
We propose a spatial capital asset pricing model and a spatial arbitrage pricing theory (S-APT) that extend the classical asset pricing models by incorporating spatial interaction. We then apply the S-APT to study the comovements of eurozone stock indices (by extending the Fama–French factor model to regional stock indices) and the futures contracts on S&P/Case–Shiller Home Price Indices; in both cases, spatial interaction is significant and plays an important role in explaining cross-sectional correlation.

## 8. Foreign Risk, Domestic Problem: Capital Allocation and Firm Performance Under Political Instability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Jan 2017
### Abstract:
We argue in this paper that firms with foreign operations misallocate capital and underperform when they face political instability abroad. We develop and test a dynamic model of firm capital allocation under foreign political instability. The model shows that as a political regime becomes less stable, independent of whether the regime becomes less business-friendly or more business-friendly, firms invest suboptimally (i.e., they either overinvest or underinvest), and their marginal q’s diverge further from an optimal level. Using elections and textual analysis of local media during national elections, we construct a novel index of political instability. We find that U.S. firms and industries with a greater exposure to election-induced political instability experience disruptions of investment efficiency that lead to lower valuations and lower total factor productivity. Therefore, international trade is a significant conduit of foreign political instability into U.S. markets.

## 9. Do Consumers Take Advantage of Common Pricing Standards? An Experimental Investigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 24 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Gaudeul and Sugden [Gaudeul A, Sugden R (2012) Spurious complexity and common standards in markets for consumer goods. Economica 79(314):209–225] have hypothesized that when some but not all competing products are priced in a common standard, consumers who are liable to make errors in cross-standard price comparisons use decision rules that discriminate in favor of common-standard offers. Such behavior incentivizes sellers to use common standards. We report an experimental test of this hypothesis, using choice tasks similar to those represented in the Gaudeul–Sugden model. We find that offers priced in common standards were more likely to be inspected but less likely to be chosen, and that subjects gained little benefit from common pricing standards that applied to some but not all offers. Most subjects used “dominance editing” operations that eliminated transparently dominated offers, either as an initial shortlisting device or while offers were being sorted. Because these operations discriminate against common-standard offers, their use incentivizes sellers not to use common standards.

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
We investigate whether mutual funds whose investors and stocks are decoupled (i.e., investor location does not coincide with that of the stock holdings) benefit from a natural hedge as they have fewer outflows during market downturns and fewer inflows during upturns. Using a sample of equity mutual funds from 26 countries, we find that funds with higher investor–stock decoupling exhibit higher performance, and this is more pronounced during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. We also find that decoupling allows fund managers to take less risk, be more active, and tilt their portfolios toward smaller and less liquid stocks.

## 11. Cost Drivers of Versioning: Pricing and Product Line Strategies for Information Goods
### Author(s):

- Amit Mehra
### Published:
- 10 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
In this paper, we extend the understanding of versioning strategy of an information goods monopolist and provide new insights on when versioning is optimal. To do so, we derive the optimal product line or versions of an information good and the corresponding prices. By relaxing common assumptions on consumers’ usage costs, versioning costs and capital research and development costs, we provide new insights as well as reconcile extant findings on versioning. For a good with no-free-disposal (NFD), i.e., one where consumers have usage costs, our results show that a monopolist’s marginal cost and consumers’ usage costs have the same impact on its versioning strategy, and that these factors are the sole reason for optimality of versioning of information goods. By endogenizing the production of the highest-quality, we show that capital costs create a downward distortion of quality even for the highest types in the market even under full information. Presence of separate versioning costs also lowers the qualities served to the high types and reduces the segment of consumers who are served with product versions. However, versioning costs do not affect market coverage or the price-quality menu itself. Further, when some of the consumer usage costs are absorbed by the firm (as in case of cloud-based provisioning), it does not necessarily lead to market expansion.

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
This paper studies the effect of learning information on people’s attitudes toward ambiguity. We propose a method to separate ambiguity attitudes from subjective probabilities and to decompose ambiguity attitudes into two components. Under models like prospect theory that represent ambiguity through nonadditive decision weights, these components reflect pessimism and likelihood insensitivity. Under multiple priors models, they reflect ambiguity aversion and perceived ambiguity. We apply our method in an experiment where we elicit the ask prices of options with payoffs depending on the returns of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange. IPOs are a natural context to study the effect of learning, as prior information about their returns is unavailable. Subjects perceived substantial ambiguity and they were insensitive to likelihood information. We observed only little pessimism and ambiguity aversion. Subjective probabilities were well calibrated and close to the true frequencies. Subjects’ behavior moved toward expected utility with more information, but substantial deviations remained even in the maximum information condition.

## 13. Multichannel Distribution Strategy: Selling to a Competing Buyer with Limited Supplier Capacity
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
We study the optimal distribution strategy of a supplier with limited capacity. The supplier may adopt the supplier-only role, be the solo seller in the market, or use the dual-channel strategy and compete with its downstream buyer. In comparison to the case of unlimited capacity, we show that the supplier, the buyer, and consumers may all benefit from the supplier’s limited capacity at the same time, leading to a “win-win-win” outcome. We also find that, under limited capacity, the downstream buyer may order the supplier’s entire capacity and strategically withhold some supply from being sold to the market even if there is no underlying supply-side or demand-side uncertainty. Our result points to a new form of strategic purchasing behavior by the buyer in the face of upstream and downstream competition. Interestingly, we show that while buyer withholding is always beneficial for the supplier, it can reduce the buyer’s profit under certain cases, although total supply chain profit is the first-best outcome. Also, counter to conventional antitrust concerns, buyer withholding at times may benefit consumers in spite of reduced downstream competition. Finally, in contrast to intuition, we find that the supplier’s benefit from investing in direct selling capability is highest when its capacity size is moderate and not large.

## 14. Reorganization and Tie Decay Choices
### Author(s):
- Adam M. Kleinbaum
### Published:
- 18 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
Whereas most research on network evolution has focused on the role of interaction opportunities in the formation of new ties, this paper addresses tie decay choices. When the opportunity structure gets reorganized, social actors make choices about which ties to retain and which to allow to decay, informed by their past experience of the tie. I argue that, conditional on changes in opportunity, people (especially those with Machiavellian personalities) choose to retain ties to valuable contacts, they retain reciprocated ties (especially with highly empathic others), and they retain socially embedded ties (especially if they are low self-monitors). The empirical design, which exploits a randomized natural experiment, confirms these hypotheses and suggests that our understanding of tie decay choices—and, consequently, of network evolution—is enhanced by an integrated theoretical perspective that encompasses both social structure and social psychology.

## 15. Ideation–Execution Transition in Product Development: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
Bringing a new product to market involves both a creative ideation stage and an execution stage. When time-to-market constraints are binding, important questions are how to divide limited time between the two stages and who should make this decision. We introduce a laboratory experiment that closely resembles this setting: it features a product development task with an open design space, a downstream cost increase, and two development stages. We show that performance is significantly worse when designers choose for themselves when to transition from ideation to execution and that decision control explains a large share of performance variation even after controlling for individual differences. How the time is allocated between ideation and execution does not affect mean performance, but later transition increases risk. One driver of poor design outcomes in the designer-initiated transition regime are delays in physical construction and testing of designs. We show that such delays can be prevented by “nudging” designers toward early prototyping. However, the most important performance driver is the lack of task structure in endogenous regimes, which can be remedied by demanding a concrete, performance-oriented deliverable prior to a transition.

## 16. Density Dependence of Entrepreneurial Dynamics: Competition, Opportunity Cost, or Minimum Efficient Scale?
### Author(s):
- Gorkem Aksaray

### Published:
- 1 May 2017
### Abstract:
This paper reports on a new examination of the well-established negative effect of localized density on survival in established industries. We attempt to discriminate between three competing, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanations: resource competition, variations in the opportunity costs of entrepreneurship, and geographic variations in minimum efficient scale (MES). We construct a model of firm growth and survival in which each of these potential causes of density dependence has a transparent parametric effect, and we derive six predictions that collectively allow for discriminating empirical tests. Empirical results using confidential geocoded data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth consistently favor the opportunity cost mechanism.

## 17. What Calls to ARMs? International Evidence on Interest Rates and the Choice of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
The relative popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) varies considerably both across countries and over time. We ask how movements in current and expected future interest rates affect the share of ARMs in total mortgage issuance. Using a nine-country panel and instrumental variables methods, we present evidence that near-term (one-year) rational forecasts of future movements in ARM rates do affect mortgage choice, particularly in more recent data since 2001. However, longer-term (three-year) rational forecasts of ARM rates have a relatively weak effect, and the current spread between FRM and ARM rates also matters, suggesting that households are concerned with current interest costs as well as with lifetime cost minimization. These conclusions are robust to alternative (adaptive and survey-based) models of household expectations.

## 18. Analysts’ Reputational Concerns, Self-Censoring, and the International Dispersion Effect
### Author(s):
- Chuan-Yang Hwang
- Yuan Li
### Published:
- 24 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
Stocks with higher forecast dispersion earn lower future returns and have a greater upward bias in the mean reported earnings forecast in international markets. Both phenomena are stronger in countries with more transparent information environments, more developed stock markets, stronger investor protection, greater capital openness, and more intense usage of analysts’ earnings forecasts. Using the 1997–1998 Asian financial crisis as a natural experiment, we find that both phenomena become weaker postcrisis in Malaysia, which imposed capital controls, relative to Thailand and South Korea, which opened their financial markets to foreigners. These results suggest that analysts in countries with greater demand for their forecasts and hence greater concerns for reputations are more likely to self-censor their low forecasts, which leads to a stronger dispersion–bias relation and a stronger dispersion effect.

## 19. Portfolio Selection with Capital Gains Tax, Recursive Utility, and Regime Switching
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Capital gains taxation has important implications for investors’ portfolio choice decisions. To explore these implications, we develop a continuous time investment and consumption model with capital gains tax, Epstein–Zin recursive utility, and regime switching. We find that various factors, such as tax rate, risk aversion, interest rate, stock return, and volatility, jointly affect optimal portfolio allocation, whereas intertemporal substitution does not. In a regime switching market, investors may trade or stop trading purely because of a change in regime, and there is a distinct cross-regime effect on optimal portfolio allocation. In particular, investors tend to raise stock investment in a bear regime so as to reduce potential tax payments upon regime switching. Given reasonable parameter values, regime switching has a greater impact on optimal portfolio allocation in a bear regime than in a bull regime.

## 20. Anticipated Entry and Entry Deterrence: Evidence from the American Casino Industry
### Author(s):
- J. Anthony Cookson
### Published:
- 23 May 2017
### Abstract:
Using new data on entry plans into the American casino industry, I find that incumbent firms invest in physical capacity when threatened with a nearby entry plan, and these strategic investments deter eventual entry. Consistent with an entry-deterrence motive, incumbents respond to the threat of entry when entry is uncertain, but not when entry is assured. The average capacity expansion of 2,300 square feet is associated with a 6.8-percentage-point greater likelihood that the entry plan fails. These findings show that investments in deterrence are viable, especially when new entrants face other significant barriers to entry.

## 21. An Experimental Investigation of Managing Quality Through Monetary and Relational Incentives
### Author(s):
- Andrew M. Davis
- Kyle Hyndman
### Published:
- 11 May 2017
### Abstract:
We investigate the efficacy of monetary and relational incentives for managing the quality of a product in a two-tier supply chain. In our setting, a retailer offers a supplier contract terms for a product, where the product can be low or high quality. The supplier can choose to exert high effort, which is costly but guarantees high quality, or low effort, which does not assure high quality with certainty. We compare how monetary incentives, such as a bonus that is paid to the supplier when high quality is received by the retailer, and relational incentives, such as the two parties engaging in a long-term relationship where there is the threat of punishment, affect overall quality and supply chain efficiency. Two of our primary results suggest that (1) relational incentives improve both quality and supply chain efficiency, regardless of whether a monetary incentive is present, and (2) when relational incentives are present, the impact of adding monetary incentives is nonmonotonic: less efficient monetary incentives appear to crowd out the benefits of relational incentives leading even to a reduction in supply chain efficiency, whereas more efficient monetary incentives actually complement relational incentives and lead to significant increases in both quality and supply chain efficiency. We then proceed by demonstrating that a behavioral model of fairness can organize the data quite well.

## 22. Choosing an n-Pack of Substitutable Products
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 May 2017
### Abstract:
We develop a framework to model the shopping and consumption decisions of forward-looking consumers. Assuming that the consumer’s future utility for each product alternative can be characterized by a standard random utility model, we use dynamic programming to determine the optimal consumption policy and the maximum expected value of consuming any n substitutable products selected while shopping (an n-pack). We propose two models. In the first (canonical) model, we assume that an alternative is consumed on each successive consumption occasion and obtain a closed-form optimal policy and a closed-form value function. Given a consumer’s preferences for the product alternatives in an assortment, we then show how to identify that consumer’s optimal n-pack using a simple swapping algorithm that converges in at most n swaps. In the second (generalized) model, we introduce an outside option so that a product alternative need not be consumed on each consumption occasion. We obtain a closed-form value function for the generalized model and show that its optimal n-pack is related to that of the canonical model using a special type of majorization. Additional structural properties and implications of each model are explored, as are other applications.

### Published:
- 27 Apr 2017
### Abstract:
We consider an unobservable M/M/1 queue where customers are homogeneous with respect to service valuation and cost per unit time of waiting. It is well known that left to themselves, in equilibrium, customers join the queue at a rate higher than is socially optimal. Hence, regulation schemes, under which the resulting equilibrium joining rate coincides with the socially optimal one, should be considered. We suggest a classification of regulation schemes based on a few desired properties and use it to classify schemes from the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing schemes possesses all of the properties, and in this paper we suggest such a scheme. Its novelty is in assigning random priorities to customers, prior to their decision whether to join or balk. We also introduce variations of this regulation scheme as well as others that are also based on randomization.

## 24. Collaboration and Multitasking in Networks: Prioritization and Achievable Capacity
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 May 2017
### Abstract:
Motivated by the trend toward more collaboration in workflows, we study networks where some tasks require the simultaneous processing by multiple types of multitasking human or indivisible resources. The capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck capacity. In Gurvich and Van Mieghem [Gurvich I, Van Mieghem JA (GVM1) Collaboration and multitasking in networks: Architectures, bottlenecks, and capacity. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 17(1):16–33], we proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical collaboration architecture, which define a collaboration level for each task depending on how many types of resources it requires. This paper studies how task prioritization impacts the achievable capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queueing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness. To maximize the capacity of a collaborative network, highest priority must be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration. Otherwise, a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss. We demonstrate this fundamental tension between flexibility in task prioritization (ability to adjust quality of service) and capacity (productivity) in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks. To manage this trade-off, we present a hierarchical threshold priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness.

## 25. Probability Forecasts Made at Multiple Lead Times
### Author(s):
- Eva Regnier
### Published:
- 8 Jun 2017
### Abstract:
Many probability forecasts are revised as new information becomes available, generating a time series of forecasts for a single event. Although methods for evaluating probability forecasts have been extensively studied, they apply to a single forecast per event. This paper is the first to evaluate probability forecasts that are made—and therefore revised—at many lead times for a single event. I postulate a norm for multi-period probability-forecasting systems and derive properties that should hold regardless of the forecasting process. I use these properties to develop methods for evaluating a forecasting system based on a sample. I apply these methods to the National Hurricane Center’s wind-speed probability forecasts and to statistical election forecasts, finding evidence that both can be improved using the current set of predictors.

### Published:
- 22 Feb 2017
### Abstract:
We study a multiserver queueing model of a revenue-maximizing firm providing a service to a market of heterogeneous price- and delay-sensitive customers with private individual preferences. The firm may offer a selection of service classes that are differentiated in prices and delays. Using a deterministic relaxation, which simplifies the problem by preserving the economic aspects of price-and-delay differentiation while ignoring queueing delays, we construct a solution to the fully stochastic problem that is incentive compatible and near optimal in systems with large capacity and market potential. Our approach provides several new insights for large-scale systems: (i) the deterministic analysis captures all pricing, differentiation, and delay characteristics of the stochastic solution that are nonnegligible at large scale; (ii) service differentiation is optimal when the less delay-sensitive market segment is sufficiently elastic; (iii) the use of “strategic delay” depends on system capacity and market heterogeneity—and it contributes significant delay when the system capacity is underutilized or when the firm offers three or more service classes; and (iv) connecting economic optimization to queueing theory, the revenue-optimized system has the premium class operating in a “quality-driven” regime and the lower-tier service classes operating with noticeable delays that arise either endogenously (“efficiency-driven” regime) or with the addition of strategic delay by the service provider.

### Published:
- 23 Mar 2017
### Abstract:
Every attribute can be expressed in multiple ways. For example, car fuel economy can be expressed as fuel efficiency (“miles per gallon”), fuel cost in dollars, or tons of greenhouse gases emitted. Each expression, or “translation,” highlights a different aspect of the same attribute. We describe a new mechanism whereby translated attributes can serve as decision “signposts” because they (1) activate otherwise dormant objectives, such as proenvironmental values and goals, and (2) direct the person toward the option that best achieves the activated objective. Across three experiments, we provide evidence for the occurrence of such signpost effects as well as the underlying psychological mechanism. We demonstrate that expressing an attribute such as fuel economy in terms of multiple translations can increase preference for the option that is better aligned with objectives congruent with this attribute (e.g., the more fuel-efficient car for those with proenvironmental attitudes), even when the new information is derivable from other known attributes. We discuss how using translated attributes appropriately can help align a person’s choices with their personal objectives.

Do monetary incentives encourage volunteering? Or, do they introduce concerns about appearing greedy and crowd out the motivation to volunteer? Since the importance of such image concerns is normally unobserved, the answer is theoretically unclear, and corresponding empirical evidence is mixed. To help counter this ambiguity, this paper proposes that the importance of image concerns—such as the desire to appear prosocial and not to appear greedy—relates to individuals’ volunteer reputations. Experimental results support this possibility. Individuals with past histories of volunteering are less responsive to image concerns if their histories are public, or if their prosocial tendencies are already known. Consistent with a decreased importance of appearing prosocial, they are less likely to volunteer. Consistent with a decreased importance of not appearing greedy, they are less likely to be discouraged by public incentives.
