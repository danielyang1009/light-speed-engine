### Abstract:
Secure messaging, or “e-visits,” between patients and providers has sharply increased in recent years, and many hope they will help improve healthcare quality, while increasing provider capacity. Using a panel data set from a large healthcare system in the United States, we find that e-visits trigger about 6% more office visits, with mixed results on phone visits and patient health. These additional visits come at the sacrifice of new patients: physicians accept 15% fewer new patients each month following e-visit adoption. Our data set on nearly 100,000 patients spans from 2008 to 2013, which includes the rollout and diffusion of e-visits in the health system we study. Identification comes from difference-in-differences estimates leveraging variation in the timing of e-visit adoption by both patients and providers. We conduct several robustness checks, including matching analyses and an instrumental variable analysis to account for possible time-varying characteristics among patient e-visit adopters.

## 2. Aeromedical Battlefield Evacuation Under Endogenous Uncertainty in Casualty Delivery Times
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
We propose a new medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) model with endogenous uncertainty in the casualty delivery times. The goal is to provide timely evacuation and medical treatment to injured soldiers. The model enforces the “Golden Hour” evacuation doctrine, attempts to maximize the expected number of severely injured soldiers evacuated within one hour without delay, and represents the availability of air ambulances as an endogenous source of uncertainty. The MEDEVAC model is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem whose continuous relaxation is in general nonconvex and for which we develop an algorithmic method articulated around (i) new bounding techniques obtained through the solution of restriction and relaxation problems and (ii) a spatial branch-and-bound algorithm solving conic mixed-integer programs at each node. The computational study, based on data from Operation Enduring Freedom, reveals that the bounding problems can be quickly solved regardless of problem size, the bounds are tight, and the spatial branch-and-bound dominates the CPLEX and BARON solvers in terms of computational time and robustness. Compared to the MEDEVAC myopic policy, our approach increases the number of casualties treated timely and can contribute to reducing the number of deaths on the battlefield. The benefits increase as the MEDEVAC resources become tighter and the combats intensify. The model can be used at the strategic level to design an efficient MEDEVAC system and at the tactical level for intelligent tasking and dispatching.

## 3. Can You Gig It? An Empirical Examination of the Gig Economy and Entrepreneurial Activity
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
We examine how the entry of gig-economy platforms influences local entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, such platforms may enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in order to pursue the nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform Uber X into local areas. We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world’s largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted with gig-economy service providers.

## 4. Efficient Allocation and Pricing of Multifeatured Items
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 28 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
We introduce feature valuations, a new class of valuations that compactly capture preferences of agents who value items based on the features they possess. Such preferences are relevant in many important practical settings, such as Internet advertising markets (where impressions have associated attributes), labor markets (where workers’ skills/titles correspond to features), and long-term bond markets (where coupon payments can be associated with features). We focus on settings where features can be organized in a tree network, and features possessed by items are captured by paths on the tree. In such settings, under appropriate consistency conditions, we establish that Walrasian equilibria exist. In addition, we provide a computationally tractable price update algorithm that terminates with market-clearing prices that support an efficient outcome.

## 5. Multidimensional Decision Making in Operations: An Experimental Investigation of Joint Pricing and Quantity Decisions
### Author(s):
- Karthik Ramachandran

### Published:
- 5 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
Firms in several industries, such as medicine, apparel, and publishing, must jointly determine the price and production quantity of their products well in advance of the selling season. Normative prescriptions to solve this problem have generally ignored behavioral aspects of decision making while behavioral research has paid limited attention to interdependent, multidimensional decisions. We experimentally examine subjects’ performance when they jointly determine price and quantities. We find that subjects systematically deviate from the theoretically optimal price and quantity levels. Contrary to expectation, decomposing the price and quantity decisions does not improve subjects’ decisions. In a series of follow-up experiments, we isolate the effects of (a) interdependence between decisions and (b) demand uncertainty. We show that decisions improve by making subjects more aware of interdependence and by reducing the uncertainty. However, reducing complexity through partial automation of the interdependent dimensions does not improve the decisions made by subjects. We also find that subjects anchor on cost for price decisions and on mean demand potential for quantity decisions, thereby explaining the consistent underpricing and overordering behavior across experiments.

## 6. Pathways to Profits: The Impact of Marketing vs. Finance Skills on Business Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 29 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
This paper examines the impact of improvements in marketing skills relative to finance skills among small-scale entrepreneurs. It addresses three important questions: (1) What is the impact of marketing or finance skills on business profits? (2) How do improvements in marketing and finance skills respectively affect different business outcomes? (3) When are increases in marketing relative to finance skills more beneficial? Through a randomized control study of 852 firms in South Africa, the analysis finds significant improvements in profitability from both types of business skills training. However, the pathways to achieve these gains differ substantially between the two groups. The marketing group achieves greater profits by adopting a growth focus on higher sales, greater investments in stock and materials, and hiring more employees. The finance group achieves similar profit gains but through an efficiency focus on lower costs. Both groups show significantly higher adoption of business practices related to their respective training program. Consistent with a growth focus, marketing/sales skills are significantly more beneficial to businesses run by entrepreneurs with ex ante less exposure to different market contexts. In contrast and in line with an efficiency focus, it is the more established businesses that benefit significantly more from finance/accounting skills.

## 7. Fixed vs. Flexible Pricing in a Competitive Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 9 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
We study the selection and dynamics of two popular pricing policies—fixed price and flexible price—in competitive markets. Our paper extends previous work in marketing, for example, Desai and Purohit (2004) by focusing on decentralized markets with a dynamic and fully competitive framework while also considering possible noneconomic aspects of bargaining. We construct and analyze a competitive search model, which allows us to endogenize the expected demand depending on pricing rules and posted prices. Our analysis reveals that fixed and flexible pricing policies generally coexist in the same marketplace, and each policy comes with its own list price and customer demographics. More specifically, if customers dislike haggling, then fixed pricing emerges as the unique equilibrium, but if customers get some additional satisfaction from the bargaining process, then both policies are offered, and the unique equilibrium exhibits full segmentation: haggler customers avoid fixed-price firms and exclusively shop at flexible firms, whereas nonhaggler customers do the opposite. We also find that prices increase in customer satisfaction, implying that sellers take advantage of the positive utility enjoyed by hagglers in the form of higher prices. Finally, considering the presence of seasonal cycles in most markets, we analyze a scenario in which market demand goes through periodic ups and downs and find that equilibrium prices remain mostly stable despite significant fluctuations in demand. This finding suggests a plausible competition-based explanation for the stability of prices.

## 8. Collusion in Bertrand vs. Cournot Competition: A Virtual Bargaining Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
How do firms manage to collude without communicating? Why do we find more collusion in price competition than in quantity competition? Why is collusion so hard to detect? We examine strategic behavior in competitive interactions by developing and applying the concept of virtual bargaining. When decision makers virtually bargain, they mentally simulate, and choose among, agreements that they could reach if they were able to explicitly negotiate with each other. Virtual bargainers focus on agreements that offer some protection against the possibility that their counterparts may deviate and best respond to these agreements. We develop a formal account of virtual bargaining and demonstrate that it leads to collusion in Bertrand, but not in Cournot, competition. In this framework, collusion is a result of virtual bargaining as a mode of reasoning and requires neither communication nor dynamic considerations, such as rewards and punishments, between the players.

## 9. The Effect of Subscription Video-on-Demand on Piracy: Evidence from a Household-Level Randomized Experiment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
We partner with a major multinational telecommunications provider to analyze the effect of subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) services on digital piracy. For a period of 45 consecutive days, a group of randomly selected households who used BitTorrent in the past were gifted with a bundle of TV channels with movies and TV shows that could be streamed as in SVoD. We find that, on average, households that received the gift increased overall TV consumption by 4.6% and reduced Internet downloads and uploads by 4.2% and 4.5%, respectively. However, and also on average, treated households did not change their likelihood of using BitTorrent during the experiment. Our findings are heterogeneous across households and are mediated by the fit between the preferences of households in our sample for movies and the content available as part of the gifted channels. Households with preferences aligned with the gifted content reduced their probability of using BitTorrent during the experiment by 18% and decreased their amount of upload traffic by 45%. We also show using simulation that the size of the SVoD catalog and licensing window restrictions limit significantly the ability of content providers to match SVoD offerings to the preferences of BitTorrent users. Finally, we estimate that households in our sample are willing to pay at most $3.25 USD per month to access a SVoD catalog as large as Netflix’s in the United States. Together, our results show that, as a stand-alone strategy, using legal SVoD to curtail piracy will require, at the minimum, offering content much earlier and at much lower prices than those currently offered in the marketplace, changes that are likely to reduce industry revenue and that may damage overall incentives to produce new content while, at the same time, curbing only a small share of piracy.

## 10. Buyer Intermediation in Supplier Finance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
Small suppliers often face challenges to obtain financing for their operations. Especially in developing economies, traditional financing methods can be very costly or unavailable to such suppliers. To reduce channel costs, large buyers have recently begun implementing their own financing methods that intermediate between suppliers and financing institutions. In this paper, we analyze the role and efficiency of buyer intermediation in supplier financing. Building a game-theoretical model, we show that buyer intermediated financing can significantly improve channel performance, and can simultaneously benefit both supply chain participants. Using data from a large Chinese online retailer and through structural regression estimation, we demonstrate that buyer intermediation lowers interest rates and wholesale prices, increases order fill rates, and boosts supplier borrowing. Based on counterfactual analysis on the data, we predict that the implementation of buyer intermediated financing will improve channel profits by 13.05%, increasing supplier and retailer profits by more than 10% each, and yielding approximately $44 million projected savings for the retailer.

## 11. Learning to Hire? Hiring as a Dynamic Experiential Learning Process in an Online Market for Contract Labor
### Author(s):
- Ming D. Leung
### Published:
- 20 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We know a job applicant’s social category affects an employer’s likelihood of hiring the applicant, but we do not know whether, or how, employers update their beliefs regarding these social categories. I portray hiring as a cognitive decision and examine how prior negative and positive hiring experiences of employees from particular countries affect an employer’s subsequent likelihood of hiring applicants from those countries. I hypothesize that employer reactions will reflect loss aversion—that employers will react more strongly to negative hiring experiences than positive ones. Furthermore, I expect that the similarity of the prior job will moderate this effect. Analyses of 3.9 million applications, from freelancers worldwide, for over 290,000 jobs on an online labor market demonstrate that employers are 15% less likely (versus 8% more likely) to hire freelancers from a country following a prior negative (versus positive) experience. Prior negative experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 82% less likely (versus 8% less likely) to hire from that country. Conversely, positive experiences with similar jobs (versus dissimilar jobs) lead employers to be 25% more likely (versus 3% more likely) to subsequently hire from that country. The consequences for switching countries, following negative experiences, are analyzed and wage differences to compensate for employer reactions, are calculated. Contributions to the hiring discrimination, impression formation, and gig-economy literatures are discussed.

## 12. Pricing with Cookies: Behavior-Based Price Discrimination and Spatial Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We present a model of dynamic competition between two firms where firms gather customer information through first-period purchase. This creates asymmetric information in the second period whereby a firm knows more about its own past customers than its competitor does. We examine how the ability to offer personalized prices based on customer information affects prices and profit over the two periods. When product differentiation is exogenously fixed, asymmetric information leads to two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive pricing to secure a larger first-period market share. When product differentiation is also chosen endogenously, there continue to exist two asymmetric equilibria where one firm chooses more aggressive positioning. The more aggressive firm, whether through pricing or positioning, can force the game to be played to its advantage. But both firms end up worse off compared to when they use simpler pricing strategies or commit to substantial product differentiation.

## 13. Structural Role Complementarity in Entrepreneurial Teams
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Nov 2017
### Abstract:
To refine the understanding of the social network characteristics of entrepreneurial teams, we present a new construct: structural role complementarity. In particular, we examine the variation between team members’ respective abilities to act as network brokers. Based on the cofounding networks of 9,461 entrepreneurs and 2,446 large-scale industrial enterprises over 45 years in Russia’s emerging economy (1869–1913), our findings show that variation among team members’ brokering ability significantly predicts the starting capital raised by their firm. The effect is moderated by the team’s average brokering potential. When both the team’s average and variation in brokering potential is high, firms raise greater starting capital. By using multiple membership models, we demonstrate that greater starting capital is largely attributable to team factors rather than the attributes of the individual team members. We also take advantage of discriminatory laws that were passed in 1887 in an instrumental variable analysis to address potential endogeneity issues.

## 14. Persistence and Procyclicality in Margin Requirements
### Author(s):
- Paul Glasserman
- Qi Wu
### Published:
- 14 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
Margin requirements for derivative contracts serve as a buffer against the transmission of losses through the financial system by protecting one party to a contract against default by the other party. However, if margin levels are proportional to volatility, then a spike in volatility leads to potentially destabilizing margin calls in times of market stress. Risk-sensitive margin requirements are thus procyclical in the sense that they amplify shocks. We use a GARCH model of volatility and a combination of theoretical and empirical results to analyze how much higher margin levels need to be to avoid procyclicality while reducing counterparty credit risk. Our analysis compares the tail decay of conditional and unconditional loss distributions with comparable stable and risk-sensitive margin requirements. Greater persistence and burstiness in volatility leads to a slower decay in the tail of the unconditional distribution and a higher buffer needed to avoid procyclicality. The tail decay drives other measures of procyclicality as well. Our analysis points to important features of price time series that should inform “antiprocyclicality” measures but are missing from current rules.

### Published:
- 31 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We investigate whether managerial traits influence corporate decisions to provide mandatory financial disclosures. The results indicate that firms with confident chief executive officers (CEOs) are 24% more likely to report their research and development (R&D) expenditures relative to firms with cautious CEOs. Exploiting staggered, state-level regulatory shocks and changes in CEO type, we find substantial evidence that cautious CEO firms fail to report R&D expenditures. After a plausibly exogenous shock to managerial reporting liability, cautious CEO firms exhibit a 35% larger reduction in unreported R&D relative to confident CEO firms. Interestingly, confident CEO firms do not exhibit more innovation than their cautious CEO counterparts after taking into account their differing propensities to report corporate R&D. Overall, our analysis suggests that the precision or reliability of mandatory disclosures systematically varies with managerial characteristics.

## 16. Measuring Agency Costs over the Business Cycle
### Author(s):
- Ramona Westermann
### Published:
- 18 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the joint effects of manager–shareholder agency conflicts and macroeconomic risk on corporate policies and firm value. I first derive the implications of a structural model of a firm with assets in place and an investment opportunity, run by a self-interested manager who captures part of the firm’s net income as private benefits. The model implies that dynamic aggregate agency costs are driven by firms in the upper half of the distribution of private benefits. Managers of those firms capture 0.8% of firms’ net income on average, thereby decreasing aggregate firm value by 1.7%. These agency costs are procyclical (1.9% in booms and 1.4% in recessions) because managerial underleverage decreases default costs particularly in recessions. Furthermore, the model can explain empirical regularities, including the joint level and cyclicality of leverage.

## 17. Uncertainty, Capital Investment, and Risk Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Aug 2017
### Abstract:
We use forward-looking and exogenous measures of output price uncertainty to examine the effect of price uncertainty on firm-level capital investment, risk management, and debt issuance. The effects of uncertainty vary significantly by firm size. When faced with high price uncertainty, large firms increase their hedging intensity but do not lower capital investment or debt issuance. In contrast, small firms do not adjust their hedging intensity but significantly lower capital expenditure and debt issuance even after controlling for investment demand. Moreover, the negative effect of uncertainty on capital investment is significantly weaker for firms that hedge their output price risk. Our analysis highlights that, in the presence of financial frictions, high price uncertainty has significant dampening effects on capital investment of small firms by exacerbating their financial constraints, and that this negative effect is amplified by firm-level constraints on ability to hedge risk exposures.

## 18. A Theory of Disclosure in Speculative Markets
### Author(s):
- Andrew Hertzberg
### Published:
- 23 Oct 2017
### Abstract:
This paper presents a theory of disclosure in a market where investors have heterogeneous beliefs and face short-sale constraints. Assets trade above fundamentals reflecting the value of the option to sell to more optimistic investors in the future. The initial seller has an incentive to commit to an imprecise disclosure policy, despite the negative effect this has on the fundamental value of the asset, in order to increase the potential for disagreement and hence the magnitude of the speculative premium. I show that there is a strategic complementarity between sellers in their disclosure decisions. This explains why financial misreporting and episodes of speculation occur together in waves and demonstrates that the endogenous choice of imprecise disclosure amplifies the extent to which assets are overpriced.

## 19. Maxing Out Globally: Individualism, Investor Attention, and the Cross Section of Expected Stock Returns
### Author(s):
- Yong-Ho Cheon
- Kuan-Hui Lee
### Published:
- 25 Sep 2017
### Abstract:
We examine the role of cultural difference in the pricing of positive extreme returns (MAX) for 47,000 stocks from 42 countries from 1990 to 2012. We find that investors overpay for stocks with high MAX and that MAX-premium, the spread from long-short strategy based on low- and high-MAX stocks, is both statistically and economically significant worldwide. The negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns, or idiosyncratic volatility puzzle, exists only for stocks with high MAX, implying that the puzzle may arise from the overpayment for stocks with high MAX and the subsequent return reversal. Consistent with the expectation that overpayment will be stronger for overconfident investors, the MAX-premium is larger in countries with high individualism index (IDV) than it is in countries with low IDV. Furthermore, we find the MAX-premium to be larger and the difference in the MAX-premium between high- and low-IDV countries to be more pronounced when VIX and volatility are high. Our findings suggest that the attention-grabbing feature of stocks with high MAX affects the pricing of extreme positive returns asymmetrically depending on the cultural differences across countries.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Mar 2018
### Abstract:
This study examines whether revolving rating analysts who transition from major rating agencies to issuers are associated with any rating inflation in the issuers’ mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or asset-backed securities (ABS). Using professional profiles posted on LinkedIn to identify revolving rating analysts with structured finance rating experience, we find that the more the issuers employ such analysts, the more likely that ratings of issuers’ MBS and ABS new issuances are inflated compared with otherwise similarly rated securities. Additional analyses show that the impact of revolving rating analysts is more pronounced in complex deals and when the revolving analysts are more senior, indicating that rating expertise in structured finance may play a role in MBS and ABS rating inflation. Finally, we find that at least for AAA-rated MBS and ABS, investors fail to see through the rating inflation associated with revolving rating analysts.

### Abstract:
We use a field experiment in Sierra Leone to examine how the identity of the manager influences rent seeking and performance in participatory development projects. Specifically, we vary the composition of a committee responsible for implementing a development project—local elites or randomly selected villagers. The design is unique in that it permits us to explore the effectiveness of two alternative local governance modalities and the extent of elite capture in community projects. We find little evidence that local elites capture project resources. We do observe they are better managers of development projects. Improved performance covaries with a proxy for power of the local chief.

## 22. Gender Composition and Group Confidence Judgment: The Perils of All-Male Groups
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Dec 2017
### Abstract:
We explore the joint effects of group decision making and group gender composition on the calibration of confidence judgments. Participants in two laboratory experiments, individually and in groups of three, stated confidence interval estimates for general-knowledge questions and for financial forecasts. Across both studies, our results reveal that groups with at least one female member are significantly better calibrated than all-male groups. This effect is mediated by the extent to which group members share opinions and information during the group discussion. Moreover, we find that compared to a statistical aggregation of individual confidence intervals, group discussions have a neutral or positive effect on the quality of confidence judgments for groups with at least one female group member; in contrast, group discussion actually harms confidence calibration for all-male groups. Overall, our findings indicate that compared to all-male groups, even the inclusion of a small proportion of female members can have a strong effect on the quality of group confidence judgment.

## 23. Oh What a Beautiful Morning! Diurnal Influences on Executives and Analysts: Evidence from Conference Calls
### Author(s):
- Jing Chen
- Elizabeth Demers
- Baruch Lev
### Published:
- 2 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
This study provides novel evidence that expert economic agents’ work-related activities are systematically influenced by the time of day. We use archival data derived from time-stamped quarterly earnings conference calls together with linguistic algorithms to measure and track the moods of executives and analysts at different times of the day. The evidence indicates that the tone of conference call discussions deteriorates markedly over the course of the trading day, with both analysts’ and executives’ moods becoming more negative as the day wears on. Capital market pricing tests reveal that the time-of-day-induced negative tone leads to temporary stock mispricings. Our findings are relevant because the diurnal variations in behavior documented in the context of quarterly earnings calls are likely to extend across other important corporate communication, decision making, and performance situations, leading to potentially significant economic consequences.

## 24. Informational Shocks, Off-Label Prescribing, and the Effects of Physician Detailing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 19 Jan 2018
### Abstract:
The relationship between pharmaceutical detailing and prescriptions for non-FDA-approved (off-label) use has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny, with more than $12 billion in regulatory settlements for off-label promotion since 2004. Using the case of AstraZeneca’s antipsychotic drug, Seroquel, I study the extent to which off-label prescriptions are caused by detailing. Using a physician panel that connects detailing exposure to medical charts, I exploit within-physician variation to identify detailing effects. I find the effect of detailing on off-label prescriptions is small in both absolute and relative terms. Detailing on net tilts the prescribing distribution toward on-label.

## 25. Simultaneous Preferences for Hedging and Doubling Down: Focal Prospects, Background Positions, and Nonconsequentialist Conceptualizations of Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Alex B. Markle
- Yuval Rottenstreich
### Published:
- 13 Feb 2018
### Abstract:
Most theories of decision making are consequentialist. They presume that people evaluate prospects on the basis of potential outcomes. However, people may often conceptualize prospects in part nonconsequentially. Consider someone evaluating a new, “focal” prospect given an unresolved “background” position to which that person is already exposed. If the two are positively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the focal prospect as a bet “with” the individual’s background position; if they are negatively correlated, the individual may conceptualize the focal prospect as a bet “against” the individual’s background position. Because people like to be consistent, this nonconsequentialist conceptualization may induce a taste for betting “with” the background position. Such bets constitute risk-seeking doubling down, not risk-averse hedging. Indeed, we observe that relative to corresponding background-less choices, participants with unresolved background positions are relatively risk-seeking, favoring positively rather than negatively correlated focal prospects. They also sometimes show a simultaneous taste for both doubling down and hedging.
