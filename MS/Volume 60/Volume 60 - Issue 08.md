### Abstract:
Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for “just-in-time” financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

## 3. Volume Flexibility in Services: The Costs and Benefits of Flexible Labor Resources

### Abstract:
Organizations can create volume flexibility—the ability to increase capacity up or down to meet demand for a single service—through the use of flexible labor resources (e.g., part-time and temporary workers, as compared to full-time workers). Although organizations are increasingly using these resources, the relationship between flexible labor resources and financial performance has not been examined empirically in the service setting. We use two years of archival data from 445 stores of a large retailer to study this relationship. We hypothesize and find that increasing the labor mix of temporary or part-time workers shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with sales and profit while temporary labor mix has a U-shaped relationship with expenses. Thus, although flexible labor resources can create volume flexibility for a firm along multiple dimensions, it is possible to have too much of a good thing.

## 4. Retail Store Density and the Cost of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Jan 2014
### Abstract:
The density, size, and location of stores in a retailer's network influences both the retailer's and the consumers' costs. With stores few and far between, consumers must travel a long distance to shop, whereas shopping trips are shorter with a dense network of stores. The layout of the retail supply chain is of interest to retailers who have emission reduction targets and urban planners concerned with sprawl. Are small local shops preferred over large, “big-box” retailers? A model of the retail supply chain is presented that includes operating costs (such as fuel and rent for floor space) as well as a cost for environmental externalities associated with carbon emissions. A focus on exclusively minimizing operating costs may substantially increase emissions (by 67% in one scenario) relative to the minimum level of emissions. A price on carbon is an ineffective mechanism for reducing emissions. The most attractive option is to improve consumer fuel efficiency—doubling the fuel efficiency of cars reduces long-run emissions by about one-third, whereas an improvement in truck fuel efficiency has a marginal impact on total emissions.

## 5. Giving Feedback to Clients
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Feb 2014
### Abstract:
We examine a prevalent form of client–agent interaction through a feedback-giving game. In this game, a client undertakes a nontrivial task and is compensated based on her task performance, which is only made known to her when the client–agent interaction ends. Meanwhile, her performance is disclosed to an agent, who must then give the client feedback on her performance. Upon receiving the feedback, the client reports her happiness level, which in turn determines the agent's payoff. In eight studies involving 928 subjects, we vary the way the agent's cash earnings depend on the client's reported happiness. When we make the agent's earnings proportional to the client's reported happiness, the agent inflates his feedback, and the client reports a higher level of happiness (than that reported in a control condition where the agent always provides honest feedback). We show that neither the agent nor the client behaves altruistically in their reporting. The client reports being happier because she overestimates her performance and mistakenly believes that the agent's feedback is genuine. The agent stops inflating his feedback when doing so no longer benefits him. Finally, our main findings are shown to be robust with respect to several factors, including making the agent's feedback consequential in affecting the client's payoff. In summary, we show that the agent behaves opportunistically, and the client's overconfidence of her own performance is what makes this strategy successful.

## 6. The Long-Run Role of the Media: Evidence from Initial Public Offerings
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
The unique characteristics of the U.S. initial public offering (IPO) process, particularly the strict quiet period regulations, allow us to explore the effects of media coverage when the coverage does not contain genuine news (i.e., hard information that was previously unknown). We show that a simple, objective measure of pre-IPO media coverage is positively related to the stock's long-term value, liquidity, analyst coverage, and institutional investor ownership. Our results are robust to additional controls for size, to using abnormal or excess media, and to an instrumental variable approach. We also find that pre-IPO media coverage is negatively related to future expected returns, measured by the implied cost of capital. In all, we find a long-term role for media coverage, consistent with Merton's attention or investor recognition hypothesis.

## 7. Compensation and Peer Effects in Competing Sales Teams
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
This paper examines how compensation systems impact peer effects and competition in collocated sales teams. We use department store sales data to show that compensation systems influence worker incentives to help and compete with peers within the same firm, which in turn changes the capability of the firm to compete with rivals. Compensation also affects how salespeople impact peers at collocated competing firms, thereby impacting market competition. Moreover, compensation influences how salespeople strategically discount prices in response to peers. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in worker ability enhances firm performance under team-based compensation while hurting individual-based firms and that peer interactions are critical considerations in designing sales force incentive plans and broader firm strategy.

## 8. Differences in Trading and Pricing Between Stock and Index Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 26 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
We find that the demand for stock options that increases exposure to the underlying is positively related to the individual investor sentiments and past market returns, whereas the demand for index options is invariant to these factors. These differences in trading patterns are also reflected in the differences in the composition of traders with different types of options—options on stocks are actively traded by individual investors, whereas trades in index options are more often motivated by the hedging demand of sophisticated investors. Consistent with a demand-based view of option pricing, the individual investor sentiments and past market returns are related to time-series variations in the slope of the implied volatility smile of stock options, but they have little impact on the prices of index options. The pricing impact is more pronounced in options with a higher concentration of unsophisticated investors and those with higher delta hedging costs. Our results provide evidence that factors not related to fundamentals also impact security prices.

## 9. Balancing Acquisition and Retention Spending for Firms with Limited Capacity

### Published:
- 13 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the interaction between revenue management and customer relationship management for a firm that operates in a customer retention situation but faces limited capacity. We present a dynamic programming model for how the firm balances investments in customer acquisition and retention, as well as retention across multiple customer types. We characterize the optimal policy and discuss how the policy changes depending on capacity limitations. We then contrast the modeling results with those of a behavioral experiment in which subjects acted as managers making acquisition and retention decisions. In the modeling part of the paper, we introduce a concept of the value of an incremental customer (VIC), and show that when capacity is unlimited, VIC equals customer lifetime value (CLV), but when capacity is limited, VIC is much smaller and changes dynamically depending on the number of customers and their mix. As a result, the optimal spending is constant and depends on CLV for the firms with unlimited capacity, but changes dynamically and is generally unrelated to CLV when capacity is limited. In the experimental part, we introduce a concept of conditional optimality for the analysis of state-dependent decisions. Applying this concept to our data, we document a number of decision biases, specifically the subjects' tendency to overspend on retaining high-value customers and underspend on lower-value customers retention and acquisition. We show that providing CLV information exacerbates these biases and leads to a loss of net revenue when capacity is limited, but providing information about the marginal costs of acquisition and retention eliminated these biases and increases net revenue.

## 10. Crowdsourcing with All-Pay Auctions: A Field Experiment on Taskcn

### Abstract:
To explore the effects of different incentives on crowdsourcing participation and submission quality, we conduct a randomized field experiment on Taskcn, a large Chinese crowdsourcing site using mechanisms with features of an all-pay auction. In our study, we systematically vary the size of the reward as well as the presence of a soft reserve, or early high-quality submission. We find that a higher reward induces significantly more submissions and submissions of higher quality. In comparison, we find that high-quality users are significantly less likely to enter tasks where a high-quality solution has already been submitted, resulting in lower overall quality in subsequent submissions in such soft reserve treatments.

## 11. Information Content When Mutual Funds Deviate from Benchmarks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 20 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
The consensus wisdom of active mutual fund managers, as reflected in their average over- and underweighting decisions, contains valuable information about future stock returns. Analyzing a comprehensive sample of active U.S. equity funds from 1984 to 2008, we find that stocks heavily overweighted by active funds outperform their underweighted counterparts by more than 7% per year, after adjustments for their loadings on the market, size, value, and momentum factors. This large premium dissipates quickly as the consensus view becomes publicly available. These results are consistent with the notion that informed investing by active mutual funds enhances the informativeness of stock prices. In addition, active mutual funds invest only a small portion of fund assets in high alpha stocks, in accordance with the consensus view that active mutual funds on average fail to outperform passive benchmarks.

## 12. Money Talks: Rebate Mechanisms in Reputation System Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
Reputation systems that rely on voluntary feedback from traders are important in creating and sustaining trust in markets. Feedback nevertheless is a public good, and providing it is often costly. We combine theory with a laboratory experiment to study the effect of a seller precommitment mechanism: Sellers have an option to commit by providing a rebate to reduce the buyer's feedback reporting cost before making purchasing decisions. Our theory predicts that this mechanism induces noncooperative sellers to cooperate in the listed-price market. Using a buyer–seller trust game with a unilateral feedback scheme, we find that the seller's rebate decision has a significant impact on the buyer's purchasing decision via signaling the seller's cooperative type. More importantly, market efficiency under the precommitment mechanism increases with the probability that sellers will provide a rebate. Compared with the no rebate mechanism market, more efficient trades can be achieved when the sellers offer a rebate to the buyers in the market with the rebate mechanism, even when the rebate does not cover the full cost of feedback reporting.

## 13. Firm-Level Productivity, Risk, and Return
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 16 Apr 2014
### Abstract:
This paper provides new evidence about the link between firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) and stock returns. We estimate firm-level TFP and show that it is strongly related to several firm characteristics such as size, the book-to-market ratio, investment, and hiring rate. Low productivity firms earn a significant premium over high productivity firms in the following year, and this premium is countercyclical. We show that a production-based asset pricing model calibrated to match the cross section of measured firm-level TFPs can replicate the empirical relationship between TFP, many firm characteristics, and stock returns. Our results offer an explanation as to how these firm characteristics rationally predict returns.

## 14. Timing Ability of Government Bond Fund Managers: Evidence from Portfolio Holdings
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Mar 2014
### Abstract:
This study examines the ability of government bond fund managers to time the bond market, based on their monthly or quarterly holdings of Treasury securities during the 1997–2006 period. We find that, on average, government bond funds exhibit significantly positive timing ability at the one-month horizon under an unconditional holdings-based timing measure. However, our results indicate that managers' actions based on public information can explain the documented positive timing ability—namely, the average government bond fund has neutral or even slightly negative conditional market timing ability once public information is controlled for. Nonetheless, we find evidence that fund managers specializing in Treasury securities can better interpret public information than general government bond fund managers do.
