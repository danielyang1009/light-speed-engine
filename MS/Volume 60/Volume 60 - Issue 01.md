## 2. Analyst Recommendations, Mutual Fund Herding, and Overreaction in Stock Prices
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 3 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
This paper documents that mutual funds “herd” (trade together) into stocks with consensus sell-side analyst upgrades, and herd out of stocks with consensus downgrades. This influence of analyst recommendation changes on fund herding is stronger for downgrades, and among managers with greater career concerns. These findings indicate that career-concerned managers are incentivized to follow analyst information, and that managers have a greater tendency to herd on negative stock information, given the greater reputational and litigation risk of holding losing stocks. Furthermore, starting in the mid-1990s (when aggregate mutual fund equity ownership is significantly higher), stocks traded by career-concerned herds of fund managers in response to analyst recommendation changes experience a significant same-quarter price impact, followed by a sharp subsequent price reversal. Our evidence suggests that analyst recommendation revisions induce herding by career-concerned fund managers, and that this type of trading has become price destabilizing with the increasing level of mutual fund ownership of stocks.

## 3. Celebrity Endorsements, Firm Value, and Reputation Risk: Evidence from the Tiger Woods Scandal
### Author(s):
- Christopher R. Knittel

### Published:
- 16 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
We estimate the stock market effects of the Tiger Woods scandal on his sponsors and sponsors' competitors. In the 10–15 trading days after the onset of the scandal, the full portfolio of sponsors lost more than 2% of market value, with losses concentrated among the core three sponsors: Electronic Arts, Nike, and PepsiCo (Gatorade). Sponsors' day-by-day losses correlate strongly with Google search intensity regarding the endorsement-related impact of the scandal, as well as with qualitative indicators of “endorsement-related news.” At least some sponsors' losses were competitors' gains, suggesting that endorsement deals are partially a business-stealing strategy. However, competitors who were themselves celebrity endorsement intensive fared relatively worse than those who were not endorsement intensive, and that difference also correlates day by day with news/search intensity regarding the scandal. It appears that the scandal sent a negative marketwide signal about the reputation risk associated with celebrity endorsements.

## 4. The Dark Side of Competition for Status
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 2 Aug 2013
### Abstract:
Unethical behavior within organizations is not rare. We investigate experimentally the role of status-seeking behavior in sabotage and cheating activities aiming at improving one's performance ranking in a flat-wage environment. We find that average effort is higher when individuals are informed about their relative performance. However, ranking feedback also favors disreputable behavior. Some individuals do not hesitate to incur a cost to improve their rank by sabotaging others' work or by increasing artificially their own performance. Introducing sabotage opportunities has a strong detrimental effect on performance. Therefore, ranking incentives should be used with care. Inducing group identity discourages sabotage among peers but increases in-group rivalry.

## 5. Television Advertising and Online Search

### Published:
- 23 May 2013
### Abstract:
Despite a 20-year trend toward integrated marketing communications, advertisers seldom coordinate television and search advertising campaigns. We find that television advertising for financial services brands increases both the number of related Google searches and searchers' tendency to use branded keywords in place of generic keywords. The elasticity of a brand's total searches with respect to its TV advertising is 0.17, an effect that peaks in the morning. These results suggest that practitioners should account for cross-media effects when planning, executing, and evaluating both television and search advertising campaigns.

## 6. Onshore and Offshore Hedge Funds: Are They Twins?
### Author(s):
- George Aragon

### Published:
- 19 Aug 2013
### Abstract:
Contrary to offshore hedge funds, U.S.-domiciled (“onshore”) funds are subject to strict marketing prohibitions, accredited investor requirements, a limited number of investors, and taxable accounts. We exploit these differences to test predictions about organizational design, investment strategy, capital flows, and fund performance. We find that onshore funds are associated with greater share restrictions, more liquid assets, and a reduced sensitivity of capital flows to superior past performance. We also find some evidence that onshore funds outperform offshore funds, depending on the sample period. The results suggest that a fund's investment and financial policies reflect differences in investor clienteles and the regulatory environment.

## 7. Matthew: Effect or Fable?
### Author(s):
- Pierre Azoulay
- Toby Stuart
- Yanbo Wang
### Published:
- 2 Aug 2013
### Abstract:
In a market context, a status effect occurs when actors are accorded differential recognition for their efforts depending on their location in a status ordering, holding constant the quality of these efforts. In practice, because it is very difficult to measure quality, this ceteris paribus proviso often precludes convincing empirical assessments of the magnitude of status effects. We address this problem by examining the impact of a major status-conferring prize that shifts actors' positions in a prestige ordering. Specifically, using a precisely constructed matched sample, we estimate the effect of a scientist becoming a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator on citations to articles the scientist published before the prize was awarded. We do find evidence of a postappointment citation boost, but the effect is small and limited to a short window of time. Consistent with theories of status, however, the effect of the prize is significantly larger when there is uncertainty about article quality, and when prize winners are of (relatively) low status at the time of election to the HHMI Investigator Program.

## 8. Optimal Hiring and Retention Policies for Heterogeneous Workers Who Learn
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 27 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
We study the hiring and retention of heterogeneous workers who learn over time. We show that the problem can be analyzed as an infinite-armed bandit with switching costs, and we apply results from Bergemann and Välimäki [Bergemann D, Välimäki J (2001) Stationary multi-choice bandit problems. J. Econom. Dynam. Control 25(10):1585–1594] to characterize the optimal hiring and retention policy. For problems with Gaussian data, we develop approximations that allow the efficient implementation of the optimal policy and the evaluation of its performance. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the value of active monitoring and screening of employees can be substantial.

## 9. Pareto Efficiency in Robust Optimization
### Author(s):
- Dan A. Iancu
- Nikolaos Trichakis
### Published:
- 16 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
This paper formalizes and adapts the well-known concept of Pareto efficiency in the context of the popular robust optimization (RO) methodology for linear optimization problems. We argue that the classical RO paradigm need not produce solutions that possess the associated property of Pareto optimality, and we illustrate via examples how this could lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in practice. We provide a basic theoretical characterization of Pareto robustly optimal (PRO) solutions and extend the RO framework by proposing practical methods that verify Pareto optimality and generate solutions that are PRO. Critically important, our methodology involves solving optimization problems that are of the same complexity as the underlying robust problems; hence, the potential improvements from our framework come at essentially limited extra computational cost. We perform numerical experiments drawn from three different application areas (portfolio optimization, inventory management, and project management), which demonstrate that PRO solutions have a significant potential upside compared with solutions obtained using classical RO methods.

## 10. Sale of Price Information by Exchanges: Does It Promote Price Discovery?
### Author(s):
- Giovanni Cespa
- Thierry Foucault
### Published:
- 23 May 2013
### Abstract:
Exchanges sell both trading services and price information. We study how the joint pricing of these products affects price discovery and the distribution of gains from trade in an asset market. A wider dissemination of price information reduces pricing errors and the transfer from liquidity traders to speculators. This effect reduces the fee that speculators are willing to pay for trading. Therefore, to raise its revenue from trading, a for-profit exchange optimally charges a high fee for price information so that only a fraction of speculators buy this information. As a result, price discovery is not as efficient as it would be with free price information. This problem is less severe if the exchange must compensate liquidity traders for a fraction of their losses.

## 11. Governance Institutions and Adaptation Costs: Evidence from the Fall of the Berlin Wall
### Author(s):
- Douglas H. Frank
### Published:
- 27 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
This paper investigates how institutions governing the employment relationship influence firms' adaptation to environmental changes. After the Berlin Wall fell, migration from East Germany accounted for an abrupt increase in the supply of a key resource—labor—in the West. I study responses to this disruption among firms in the economically important machinery and equipment industry. I find that western firms adapted to migration by increasing employment unless they were affiliated with a works council, an institution that limits the firm's autonomy in managing its workforce. I also find evidence of institution-contingent responses to migration in two areas of firm strategy: vertical boundaries and the focus on exploration versus exploitation. The results suggest that “hybrid” (i.e., less hierarchical) governance institutions increase adaptation costs. The results also indicate that such adaptation costs have implications for multiple aspects of firm decision making that are nominally beyond the scope of those governance institutions.

## 12. Consumer Favorites and the Design of News
### Author(s):
- Yi Xiang
- David Soberman
### Published:
- 16 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to better understand the factors that competitive news providers consider to design or deliver news programmes. The focus is broadcast news where, in any programming time period, a viewer watches (or consumes) one programme. We assume that each viewer is interested in a limited set of topics and that her utility only comes from the “most interesting” news she observes. The key questions we address are as follows: (a) Should firms adopt designs that facilitate the delivery of more information in their news programmes? (b) Does the decision of firms to implement such strategies depend on the complexity of the news programme (i.e., the number of news stories covered in the news product)? (c) How do such strategies influence competition? We show that firms may or may not benefit by providing better-designed news. The incentive to do this is strongly affected by the complexity of the news product and the intensity of competition between news providers.

## 13. Uncertainty, Risk, and Incentives: Theory and Evidence
### Author(s):
- Zhiguo He

### Published:
- 2 Aug 2013
### Abstract:
Uncertainty has qualitatively different implications than risk in studying executive incentives. We study the interplay between profitability uncertainty and moral hazard, where profitability is multiplicative with managerial effort. Investors who face greater uncertainty desire faster learning, and consequently offer higher managerial incentives to induce higher effort from the manager. In contrast to the standard negative risk-incentive trade-off, this “learning-by-doing” effect generates a positive relation between profitability uncertainty and incentives. We document empirical support for this prediction.

## 14. Understanding the Effect of Advertising on Stock Returns and Firm Value: Theory and Evidence from a Structural Model
### Author(s):
- Maria Ana Vitorino
### Published:
- 27 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
This paper brings structural modeling to the literature on financial research in marketing. I propose a dynamic investment-based model to understand the impact of advertising expenditures on stock returns and firm value. In addition, by interpreting advertising expenditures as an investment in brand capital, the approach in this paper provides a novel way to measure brand equity grounded in economic theory. Using the Euler equations from the firm's maximization problem, I derive closed-form expressions for the firm's equilibrium stock returns and market value, which depend on observable firm characteristics. I test the model's predictions by the generalized method of moments and data from a large cross section of publicly traded firms. The model is able to match simultaneously the pattern of average stock returns and firm values of portfolios sorted on advertising expenditures that standard asset pricing models cannot. The estimation results also show that brand equity accounts for a substantial fraction of firm market value (about 23%), and that this value varies substantially across industries. Implications of the findings for research at the intersection of marketing and finance are discussed.

## 15. Corporate Risk Management: Integrating Liquidity, Hedging, and Operating Policies
### Author(s):
- Andrea Gamba
- Alexander J. Triantis
### Published:
- 3 Sep 2013
### Abstract:
We analyze the value created by a dynamic integrated risk management strategy involving liquidity management, derivatives hedging, and operating flexibility, in the presence of several frictions. We show that liquidity serves a critical and distinct role in risk management, justifying high levels of cash. We find that the marginal value associated with derivatives hedging is likely to be low, though we explain why some empirical studies find a higher value. We explore the complex interactions between operating flexibility and financial risk management, finding that substitution effects are nonmonotonic and are affected by operating leverage, the nature of operating flexibility, and the effectiveness of the hedging instrument.
