## 1. Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization
### Author(s):
- Andre F. Perold
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
This paper describes a practical algorithm for large-scale mean-variance portfolio optimization. The emphasis is on developing an efficient computational approach applicable to the broad range of portfolio models employed by the investment community. What distinguishes these from the usual quadratic program is (i) the form of the covariance matrix arising from the use of factor and scenario models of return, and (ii) the inclusion of transactions limits and costs. A third aspect is the question of whether the problem should be solved parametrically in the risk-reward trade off parameter, , or separately for several discrete values of . We show how the parametric algorithm can be made extremely efficient by sparsifying the covariance matrix with the introduction of a few additional variables and constraints, and by treating the transaction cost schedule as an essentially nonlinear nondifferentiable function. Then we show how these two seemingly unrelated approaches can be combined to yield good approximate solutions when minimum trading size restrictions (buy or sell at least a certain amount, or not at all) are added. In combination, these approaches make possible the parametric solution of problems on a scale not heretofore possible on computers where CPU time and storage are the constraining factors.

## 2. A Longitudinal Study of the Corporate Life Cycle
### Author(s):
- Danny Miller
- Peter H. Friesen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
A review of recent literature on the corporate life cycle disclosed five common stages: birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline. Theorists predicted that each stage would manifest integral complementarities among variables of environment (situation), strategy, structure and decision making methods; that organizational growth and increasing environmental complexity would cause each stage to exhibit certain significant differences from all other stages along these four classes of variables; and that organizations tend to move in a linear progression through the five stages, proceeding sequentially from birth to decline. These contentions were tested by this study. A sample of 161 periods of history from 36 firms were classified into the five life cycle stages using a few attributes deemed central to each. Analyses of variance were performed on 54 variables of strategy, structure, environment and decision making style. The results seemed to support the prevalence of complementarities among variables within each stage and the predicted inter-stage differences. They did not, however, show that organizations went through the stages in the same sequence.

## 3. A Partial Covering Approach to Siting Response Resources for Major Maritime Oil Spills
### Author(s):
- S. Belardo
- J. Harrald
- W. A. Wallace
- J. Ward
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
In this paper, oil spills occurring near shore in semienclosed waterways are viewed as emergency events. A partial set covering model, similar to those developed for firehouse location analysis, is applied to the problem of locating oil spill response equipment. The model includes both assessments of the relative probability of occurrence and the impact after occurrence of various spill types. A multiple objective approach enables the decisionmaker to evaluate strategies without confounding the probability of occurrence with the impact of occurrence.

## 4. Monitoring an Input-Output Model for Production. I. The Control Charts
### Author(s):
- D. R. Jensen
- Y. V. Hui
- P. M. Ghare
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
Control charts are given for monitoring an input-output model against changes in form, against changes in its coefficients, and against changes in process variance. When a process is not in control due to changes in some coefficients, monitoring shifts to a diagnostic mode to identify the altered coefficients and thus the needed adjustments to the process. Control limits from special aid tables are used; these are considered along with the choice of design. Operating characteristics of the charts are summarized under standard assumptions.

## 5. A Queueing System with Auxiliary Servers
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
We examine a queueing system with multiple primary servers and a fewer number of auxiliary servers. There are two classes of customersthose who require service from a primary server working alone and those who require service from a primary server who is assisted by an auxiliary server. Though the apparent Markovian state space is five-dimensional, we show that an aggregation results in an exact two-dimensional representation which is Markovian. Matrix geometric theory is used to obtain approximations for the mean delay and blocking probability of each customer type.

## 6. Asymptotic Properties of Some Confidence Interval Estimators for Simulation Output
### Author(s):
- David Goldsman
- Lee Schruben
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
The classical confidence interval estimator commonly used in simulation is compared with four new estimators based on standardization of a time series presented in a previous paper. These new interval estimators are shown to have asymptotic properties that strictly dominate the classical estimator when used with data from independent simulation replications or means of batched observations from a single simulation run. Two of the new estimators also can be used with a single unbatched replication of a simulation program, a situation where the classical estimator is not defined.

## 7. Effect of Risk Aversion on Single Sample Attribute Inspection Plans
### Author(s):
- Herbert Moskowitz
- Robert Plante
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
The impact of a decision maker's risk aversion on the choice of an optimal sampling plan is empirically examined for various batch sizes and prior distributions of the process quality level. These plans are compared to those of the classical linear cost model. The comparisons show that substantial differences in the characteristics of an optimal sampling plan (i.e., probability of acceptance, optimal sample size and expected total cost) occur when risk aversion is considered. A discussion of the optimization characteristics involved in the selection of a sampling plan is also presented. An optimization algorithm which obtains an optimal sampling plan based on the criterion of maximizing expected utility is proposed and evaluated.

## 8. A Perturbation Scheme to Improve Hilliers Solution to the Facilities Layout Problem
### Author(s):
- Christopher J. Picone
- Wilbert E. Wilhelm
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
This paper describes a new heuristic, the Revised Hillier procedure, for solving the facilities layout problem. It incorporates the effective features of the well-known Hillier procedure in combination with 3-way and 4-way exchanges to extend the neighborhood over which the search for a solution is conducted. Performance of the new heuristic is compared with that of CRAFT and the original Hillier procedure using a set of standard test problems; the Revised Hillier procedure yields solutions of higher quality while requiring only modest increases in computer run time.

## 9. Periodic Review Inventory Systems with Continuous Demand and Discrete Order Sizes
### Author(s):
- John N. Tsitsiklis
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
We study a single product inventory system with nonnegative setup cost in which the demand is a continuous random variable but orders are restricted to be integer valued. Optimal policies, when there are no setup costs, have a nice form. However, we show that, when the setup costs are nonzero, optimal policies may have a very counterintuitive form without any particular structure. We obtain a bound for the increase in costs resulting from the restriction of orders to be integers and define a suboptimal policy whose performance is within that bound.

## 10. Strong Formulations for Multi-Item Capacitated Lot Sizing
### Author(s):
- Imre Barany
- Tony J. Van Roy
- Laurence A. Wolsey
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1984
### Abstract:
Multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problems are reformulated using a class of valid inequalities, which are facets for the single-item uncapacitated problem. Computational results using this reformulation are reported, and problems with up to 20 items and 13 periods have been solved to optimality using a commercial mixed integer code. We also show how the valid inequalities can easily be generated as part of a cutting plane algorithm, and suggest a further class of inequalities that is useful for single-item capacitated problems.
