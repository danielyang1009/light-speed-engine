## 1. Effects of Planning Aids and Presentation Media on Performance and Affective Responses in Strategic Decision-Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
The Dialectical Inquiry System (DIS) and the Devil's Advocate (DA) have been recommended as strategic decision-making aids and as improvements on the traditional expert (E) approach in which strategic decisions are based on preliminary analyses and proposals by staff experts. Previous research on the effects of the DIS and DA has produced conflicting results. In the present study, subjects produced alternative strategies and recommendations for a company described in a case. They were given the E, DA, or DIS treatment either in written form or via videotape. In addition, some were assigned to a control (C) group and received no planning assistance. The results showed that the written DA, the videotape DI, and the videotape E treatment caused subjects to generate fewer functional area alternatives than the C subjects. Further, the subjects receiving the written DA generated more strategic alternatives than those receiving the written DIS or E. The DA also reduced the effects of an expert report on subjects' final recommendations while the DIS did not. Subjects given the DA and DIS reported greater satisfaction with the process than those given the E.

## 2. Assessing Scenario Probabilities Via Interactive Goal Programming
### Author(s):

- Herbert Moskowitz
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
An interactive goal programming approach for assessing scenario probabilities used in long-range forecasting and decision analysis is developed and illustrated using a small numerical example. The method only requires marginal event probability and ordinal or interval first-order conditional probability assessments of a limited number of events constituting the scenarios and guarantees the consistency of the assessments in terms of the laws of probability calculus.

## 3. A Goal Programming Example in Public Health Resource Allocation
### Author(s):
- Kim M. Tingley
- Judith S. Liebman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
A model developed to aid a state-level resource allocation process in the United States Department of Agriculture Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is presented. The model is formulated as a linear integer goal program, utilizing service levels for six categories of WIC participants as goals. The model employs a methodical, consistent approach to the allocation process, yet allows ample flexibility for consideration of state-specific issues. By allowing the user to adjust the relative importance of each goal, the model can incorporate subjective attitudes of state-level WIC administrators. This is extremely important as these attitudes are the result of the administrators' familiarity with the WIC program in their states, and the significance of input of this nature should not be neglected.

## 4. An Analysis of Network Location Problems with Distance Constraints
### Author(s):

- Sohail S. Chaudhry
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
This paper concerns a class of network location problems with minimum or maximum separation requirements between (uncapacitated) facilities or between demand points and the facilities, or both. Its purpose is three-fold. First, it is to recognize distance constraints as increasing real life restrictions through various motivating illustrations. Using a new classification scheme, the paper introduces a variety of distance-constrained problems defined in a unified manner. These include a number of new problems. Second, it is to survey existing solution techniques, available only for a few of such constrained problems. Finally, it is to shed some light on yet unstudied problems by exploring possible extensions of some of the known solution techniques or discussing varying degrees of difficulties involved. In particular, the paper presents integer programming formulations of several new problems along with the results of applying linear programming relaxation methods. Although the computational experience is somewhat disappointing for some of these problems, the results provide greater insight into the problems. With the stated purpose, it is hoped that this paper will stimulate future research in this important problem area.

## 5. Network Programming Models for Production Scheduling in Multi-Stage, Multi-Item Capacitated Systems
### Author(s):
- Anthony Zahorik
- L. Joseph Thomas
- William W. Trigeiro
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
This paper investigates a multi-item, multi-level production scheduling problem with linear costs and production and inventory constraints at one key facility. Two multi-item problemsone in which the constraint was on shipping capability and one in which there was a final stage bottleneck machinemotivated the paper. A multi-item facilities-in-series problem is formulated, in standard fashion, as a linear program. Then we show that in certain important cases the 3-period problem is a network problem. This 3-period result is used as the basis for a rolling heuristic for T-period problems. The conditions under which this heuristic fails to find optimal solutions are discussed and computational comparisons to standard linear programming are given. Finally, we discuss ways of dealing with two constrained facilities and with setup costs.

## 6. Coalition Formation in a Five-Person Market Game
### Author(s):
- Amnon Rapoport
- James P. Kahan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
Market games constitute a class of cooperative n-person games with sidepayments in which several coalitions may form simultaneously. In order to study coalition forming behavior in such games and to test the descriptive power of four major solution concepts that yield differing prescriptions for market games, 11 pentads of students each played 6 different market games presented in characteristic function form through a computer-controlled experimental procedure. The outcomes showed strong consistencies over pentads and sharp differences among games. None of the models fully accounted for these data. Instead, considerations of sequential formation of coalitions within a coalition structure, the concept of maximal share structure suggested in the equal share solution, and a recently developed model, that encompasses the predictions of the bargaining set and equal shares, served jointly as the first-order determinants of both the decision of which coalition to form and the allocation of payoff to coalition members.

## 7. Coordinated Replenishments in a Multi-Item Inventory System with Compound Poisson Demands
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
In many practical applications or multi-item inventory systems significant economies of scale can be exploited when coordinating replenishment orders for groups of items. This paper considers a continuous review multi-item inventory system with compound Poisson demand processes; excess demands are backlogged and each replenishment requires a lead time. There is a major setup cost associated with any replenishment of the family of items, and a minor (item dependent) setup cost when including a particular item in this replenishment. Moreover there are holding and penalty costs. We present an algorithm which searches for a simple coordinated control rule minimizing the long-run average cost per unit time subject to a service level constraint per item on the fraction of demand satisfied directly from on-hand inventory. This algorithm is based on a heuristic decomposition procedure and a specialized policy-iteration method to solve the single-item subproblems generated by the decomposition procedure. The model applies to multi-location inventory systems with similar cost structures for coordinated deliveries.

## 8. Age Replacement Under Alternative Cost Criteria
### Author(s):

- S. Humble
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
Due to the complexity of optimum replacement problems over finite lime horizons various asymptotic criteria based upon fixed age replacement policies have been employed in the literature and in practice. In this paper the relationships between the optimum policies under three alternative cost criteria are considered. An ordering of the accounting costs under two of these is obtained, and for distributions with Increasing Hazard Rate an ordering of the optimum replacement time is derived. For a finite time horizon the policies are compared to the optimal sequential and fixed-age replacement polices through the example of a gamma distribution previously investigated by Barlow and Proschan (Barlow, R. E., F. Proschan. 1962. Planned replacement. K. J. Arrow, S. Karlin, W. L. Smith, eds. Studies in Applied Probability and Management Science. Stanford University Press, Stanford, Cal.; Barlow, R. E., F. Proschan. 1965. Mathematical Theory of Reliability. Wiley, New York.).

## 9. A Study of Production Smoothing in a Job Shop Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of smoothing production in a job shop in which all production is to customer order and the demand process is a stationary stochastic process. We present an approach to production smoothing based on the concept of a planning window. A planning window is the difference between the promised delivery time and the planned production time for a product. It represents the degree of flexibility available for planning the production of committed orders. We characterize the production smoothing benefits for a range of planning windows by means of an approximate analytic model and a simulation study. These analyses show that substantial smoothing benefits result from small changes in the length of the planning window. We discuss the implementation of the production smoothing approach and illustrate this implementation with an industrial case study that was the motivation for this work.

## 10. A Diffusion Approximation for an M/G/m Queue with Group Arrivals
### Author(s):
- Toshikazu Kimura
- Tadashi Ohsone
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the M/G/m queueing system with group arrivals. Using a diffusion approximation, we present approximate formulae for the steady-state distribution of the number of customers in the system. From this distribution, approximate formulae for some queueing characteristics such as the delay probability and the mean queue length are derived. In order to check the accuracy of the approximate formulae, they are numerically tested on some special cases.

## 11. NoteRemoving a Self-Imposed Restriction in Modelling Hierarchical Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
- James Storbeck
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1984
### Abstract:
Models of decision-making in multi-level, hierarchical systems in the literature have been restricted to structures where the system is strictly pyramidal in nature. We will show that this restriction has been self-imposed and that existing models can be modified to represent a wide range of nonpyramidal structures.
