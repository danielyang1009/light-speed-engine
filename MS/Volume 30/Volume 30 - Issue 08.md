## 1. The Natural Logic of Management Policy Making: Its Implications for the Survival of an Organization
### Author(s):
- Roger I. Hall
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
A process-theoretic approach, seldom used but not without promise for organizational behavior research, is employed to postulate a process model of the natural logic evident in organizational policy making. The model is used to explain how the policies of a sample firm (for which 20 years of data are available) became adopted and how, together with critical events, this caused the firm to evolve in particular directions rather than others. Implications of the study are put forward in terms of identifying pathologies of the policy making process. Some prescriptions are put forward for the proper control of organizations by supervisory bodies, such as boards of directors. It is suggested that Management Science, in the form of systematic procedures for adaptive organizational design and updatable cause maps, may have an important future role to play in senior management affairs.

## 2. The Nature and Design of Post-Industrial Organizations
### Author(s):
- George P. Huber
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
This paper describes the nature and design of post-industrial organizations. It begins with an assessment of the popular literature on post-industrial society, and finds that this literature is an inappropriate basis for inferring the nature of post-industrial organizations. Partly as a consequence of this finding, the paper turns to systems theory as a basis for determining both the nature of post-industrial society and the nature of the increased demands that this environment would impose on post-industrial organizations. The middle three sections of the paper describe design features that post-industrial organizations will employ to deal with these demands. In particular they examine designs for making more effective three processes that will exhibit increased importance in post-industrial organizations: (1) decision-making, (2) innovation, and (3) information acquisition and distribution.

## 3. Portfolio Theory for Independent Assets
### Author(s):
- Paul L. McEntire
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
This paper presents several new concepts for portfolio problems with independently distributed asset prices. A criterion is developed for including or excluding assets in an optimal portfolio for an investor maximizing the expected value of a von NeumannMorgenstern utility function. The central concept of the generalized harmonic mean is introduced: it is shown to be the analogue of the riskless rate of return for problems without a riskless asset. A new ordering theorem is proven, showing that an optimal portfolio always consists of positive amounts of the assets with the largest mean values. Next, the concept of independence from irrelevant alternatives is introduced for portfolio problems; this is a property of utility functions and is proven to be true for most of the commonly used utility functions. Altogether, the results provide new insights and tools for portfolio problems with independent assets and extend earlier results by Samuelson, and Fishburn and Porter.

## 4. The Feasibility of One-Officer Patrol in New York City
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
How many patrol cars staffed with a single police officer are needed to provide equivalent police service to an existing system with n two-officer patrol cars? This question is explored for New York City using a multiple patrol car per call priority queueing model. It is shown that a one-officer patrol program is feasible, yet pitfalls exist which could adversely affect its performance. The paper details the process of data analysis and model building and emphasizes the subjective elements that remain in a highly technical OR study. Speed of response to emergency calls from the public was the key performance characteristic considered. The analysis also raised issues related to the safety of police officers in one-officer cars.

## 5. Estimating Learning Curves from Aggregate Monthly Data
### Author(s):
- Norman Keith Womer
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
In this paper the problems of using aggregate monthly data to estimate learning curves are investigated. Here, aggregate monthly data on labor hours are assumed to contain some of both fixed and variable labor hours. They are also assumed to be influenced by fluctuating quantities of work in process. A distributed lag model is developed to deal with these two characteristics of aggregate monthly data. The model is generalized to permit production rate to influence labor productivity. This generalized model is then estimated and compared to a cumulative average learning curve in analyzing the impact of a production break. A set of production data which arose from a government contract claim is used for this purpose.

## 6. A Comparison of the Optimal Ordering Levels of Bayesian and Non-Bayesian Inventory Models
### Author(s):
- Katy S. Azoury
- Bruce L. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
Although it is often the case that the parameters of the distribution of demand are not known with certainty and that a Bayesian formulation would be appropriate, such an approach is generally not used in inventory calculations for computational reasons. Since one often resorts to a non-Bayesian formulation, it is of interest to compare Bayesian policies with a comparable non-Bayesian policy. Using the concept of flexibility it was anticipated that the quantity ordered under the non-Bayesian policy would be greater than or equal to that under a Bayesian policy. This result is established for the n-period nondepletive inventory model. However, a two-period counterexample is given for the standard (depletive) inventory model.

## 7. Two-Level Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Wayne F. Bialas
- Mark H. Karwan
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
Decentralized planning has long been recognized as an important decision making problem. Many approaches based on the concepts of large-scale system decomposition have generally lacked the ability to model the type of truly independent subsystems which often exist in practice. Multilevel programming models partition control over decision variables among ordered levels within a hierarchical planning structure. A planner at one level of the hierarchy may have his objective function and set of feasible decisions determined, in part, by other levels. However, his control instruments may allow him to influence the policies at other levels and thereby improve his own objective function. This paper examines the special case of the two-level linear programming problem. Geometric characterizations and algorithms are presented with some examples. The goal is to demonstrate the tractability of such problems and motivate a wider interest in their study.

## 8. The Factored Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- James R. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
The factored transportation problem is one having cost coefficients of the form cij = uivj. The main result proven in this paper is that if rows are arranged according to nonincreasing ui and columns by nondecreasing vj, then the northwest corner rule provides an optimal solution. Applications to stock location in a warehouse and information storage and retrieval policies are presented. For the stock location problem, this verifies that a previously advocated heuristic is optimal.

## 9. NoteOn Optimizing Field Repair Kits Based on Job Completion Rate
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1984
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Mamer and Smith (Mamer, J. W., S. A. Smith. 1982. Optimizing field repair kits based on job completion rate. Management Sci.28 (11) 13281333.) presented a formulation for determining the optimal kit of parts and tools for on-site equipment repairs under a job completion criterion. The optimal kit minimizes the sum of expected broken job costs plus the annual inventory holding cost for those parts stocked. A broken job occurs whenever a repair cannot be completed because one or more of its required parts are not included in the field repair kit. Assuming equal penalties for all broken jobs, an algorithm developed by Eisner and Severance (Eisner, M. J., D. G. Severance. 1976. Mathematical techniques for efficient record segmentation in large shared databases. J. Assoc. Comput. Mach.23 (4) 619635.) in a different context can be used to determine a set of optimal policies and a range on the penalty cost for which each policy is optimal. The ranges cover all penalty costs from 0 to . This is significant for the repair kit problem since the actual penalty cost of broken jobs may be difficult to determine exactly.
