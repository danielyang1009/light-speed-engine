## 1. Blood Inventory Management: An Overview of Theory and Practice
### Author(s):
- Gregory P. Prastacos
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
Blood Inventory Management has attracted significant interest from the Operations Research profession during the last 15 years. A number of methodological contributions have been made in the areas of inventory theory and combinatoric optimization that can be of use to other products or systems. These contributions include the development of exact and approximate ordering and issuing policies for an inventory system, the analysis of LIFO or multi-product systems, and various forms of distribution scheduling. In addition, many of these results have been implemented, either as decision rules for efficient blood management in a hospital, or as decision support systems for hierarchical planning in a Regional Blood Center.

## 2. Estimation of Attribute Weights from Preference Comparisons

### Abstract:
The multi-attribute utility model serves as a basis for many marketing decisions such as new product planning and advertising message selection. The estimation of individuals' attribute weights can be performed using several data types and estimation techniques. There is evidence to suggest that the estimates derived from ordinal preference data through linear programming show greater stability and predictive validity. In this paper we address two fundamental issues which have not been addressed in the context of this latter type estimation: the theoretical foundations for estimating cardinal utility functions from ordinal preference data and the properties of the linear programming estimators. First, we establish the theoretical foundations from economics, mathematical psychology, and decision analysis of obtaining a cardinal (interval scaled) multi-attribute function from ordinal data. This leads us to recommend that in addition to the collection of paired preference comparisons, also comparisons of pairs of pairs be collected. We then describe the type of errors which are likely to arise in the measurement stage, and their relationship to the phenomenon of intransitivities. We formulate a linear program, LINPAC, for the estimation of attribute weights from the above preference data. The previously proposed LINMAP procedure is a special case of this formulation when only the information on the paired preferences is utilized. Next, the statistical properties of the estimators, such as uniqueness, unbiasedness, consistency and efficiency, are examined. Then, through a simulation study we examine the rate of convergence of the estimated weights to the true weights as a function of the number of brands. In the simulation study we also examine the conditions under which the estimators outperform equal weights and compare the estimates derived from LINPAC with those derived from LINMAP. Finally, the estimation procedures are examined with actual data while the simulation results, an equal weights model, and a stated weights model serve as benchmarks.

## 3. Setting Standards: A Systematic Approach to Managing Public Health and Safety Risks
### Author(s):
- Baruch Fischhoff
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
Standards are an effective means for managing hazardous technologies only if three conditions are satisfied: (a) setting general standards is preferable to case-by-case decision making; (b) some general safety philosophy, balancing risk and other factors, can be justified on normative grounds; (c) that philosophy is faithfully translated into operational terms. In practice, standards are rarely developed and enforced in an integrated systematic way. As a result, they often miss their mark. This guide presents a general framework for the design, development, and implementation of safety standards. That framework is derived from the logical character of the standard setters' task and from experience with actual standards. It first identifies the conditions under which standards are an appropriate management tool. Second, it presents four generic methods that may be used to develop safety policy. Third, it characterizes the design issues that arise in making that policy operational. At each step, it suggests particular strategies along with their inherent strengths and weaknesses. In particular, it shows the sensitivity of a standard's effectiveness to seemingly technical aspects of the way it is drafted.

## 4. Scheduling School Buses
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
In the scheduling situation considered here, we are given a set of routes, each associated with a particular school. A single bus is assigned to each route, picking up the students and arriving at their school within a specified time window. The scheduling problem is to find the fewest buses needed to cover all the routes while meeting the time window specifications. We present two integer programming formulations of the scheduling problem and apply them to actual data from New Haven, Connecticut for two different years, as well as to 30 randomly generated problems. Linear programming relaxations of these integer programs were found to produce integer solutions more than 75 percent of the time. In the remaining cases, we found that the few fractional values can be adjusted to integer values without increasing the number of buses needed. Our method reduces the number of buses needed by about 25 percent compared to the manual solutions developed by the New Haven school bus scheduler.

## 5. A Comparison of Exact Approaches for Solving the Multiple Constrained Resource, Project Scheduling Problem
### Author(s):
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
A recurring problem in managing project activity involves the allocation of scarce resources to the individual activities comprising the project Resource conflict resolution decisions must be made whenever the concurrent demand for resources by the competing activities of a project exceeds resource availability. When these resource conflict resolution decisions arise, project managers seek direction on which activities to schedule and which to delay in order that the resulting increase in project duration is the minimum that can be achieved with the given resource availabilities. The procedures examined in this paper are all designed to provide for this type of decision support. Each procedure examined is enumerative based, methodically searching the set of possible solutions in such a way that not all possibilities need be considered individually. The methods differ in the manner in which the tree representing partial schedules is generated and is saved, and differ in the methods which are used to identify and discard inferior partial schedules. Each procedure was found to be generally superior on a specific class of problems, and these classes are identified.

## 6. Sense-Making of Accounting Data as a Technique of Organizational Diagnosis
### Author(s):
- Richard J. Boland, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
Planning is a process of inquiry. Inquiry can be enhanced if different views-of-the-world are used to inform each other. In an exploratory field study, a sense-making exercise was used in the initial, goal definition stage of planning. Its use is antithetical because sense-making denies that management action is based on preconceived goals or objectives. Instead, sense-making assumes management action is a continuous, equivocal stream of experience that can only be understood (or made sense of) when it is viewed in retrospect.

## 7. Scheduling Jobs with Exponentially Distributed Processing Times on Two Machines with Resource Constraints
### Author(s):
- Michael Pinedo
- Gideon Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1984
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of minimizing the expected makespan of n jobs with independent exponentially distributed processing times on two parallel machines, under resource constraints. Job j has expected processing time 1/j and requires throughout its processing an amount rj of a resource; the total amount of resource available is r. In the case where 1/1 <  < 1/n and r1 <  < rn, we characterize all the optimal policies in the class of preemptive schedules, and show that the following nonpreemptive policy is optimal: Find the largest k for which rk + rk1 < r, and start processing jobs k  1, k. Thereafter, at any job completion, start processing on the machine that is freed, the longest job compatible with the job running on the other machine.

## 8. Economic Models for R and D Project Selection in the Presence of Project Interactions
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
One reason existing approaches for dealing with benefit interactions in economic R and D project selection models are difficult to apply is that it is difficult to assess the interactions directly. This difficulty can be traced at least in part to the lack of a modeling framework within which different types of interaction can be identified and related to project and portfolio benefit. In this paper, a modeling framework is proposed within which certain kinds of benefit interactions, called present value (PV) interactions, are assessed indirectly by explicitly modeling R and D project impacts on profitability. Within the proposed framework, the role of traditionally recognized types of interaction in the calculation of present value is clarified, and it is shown that PV interaction exists even when traditionally recognized types of interaction are assumed to be absent. The proposed framework offers one method for assessing PV interactions. An example illustrates the framework and shows that ignoring PV interactions can result in both nonoptimal project selections and resource allocations, even when traditionally recognized types of interactions are absent. The framework and resulting model should be useful in enhancing decision making in firms using PV-based approaches to project selection, whether or not they are interested in using a model that accounts for PV interactions. This is expected since the overall framework provides a basis for analyzing the probable consequences of assuming that no PV interaction is present and for communicating these probable consequences to management
