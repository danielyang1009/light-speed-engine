## 1. An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Graphical and Tabular Data Presentations on Decision Making
### Author(s):
- William Remus
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
A key issue in designing a computer-based decision support system is how best to depict the data. Since most systems use either graphical or tabular displays, this experiment compares the latter two when used as decision aids for the production scheduling problem modeled by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon. The tabular aids and the graphical aids yield equally costly decisions. When the erratic components of the decisions are reduced, the tabular aids outperform the graphical aids.

### Abstract:
In this paper the theory and estimation procedures for several consumer preference models are discussed. Predictive accuracy in the form of internal consistency of these models is compared in an empirical application.

## 3. Effects of Federal Support on Company-Financed R and D: The Case of Energy
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
- Lorne Switzer
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
For decades, policy makers in both the public and private sectors have been concerned with the question: What is the impact of changes in federal R and D support on company-financed R and D expenditures? This is one of the first empirical studies at a micro level of this topic. The results, which pertain to energy R and D, indicate a complementarity between government-financed and company-financed R and D, on the average, although there is a considerable amount of interfirm variation in this regard. In about one-third of the projects studied, federally-financed R and D projects suggested some further R and D into which the firm invested its own funds. The results of a logit analysis suggest that whether or not a government-financed R and D project results in such a spinoff depends on the extent to which the performing firm contributes to the formulation of the projects goals and strategies.

## 4. The Effects of Communication on Technological Innovation
### Author(s):
- Yar M. Ebadi
- James M. Utterback
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
This study examined the relationship between communication and technological innovation. It focused on the patterns of technical communication among researchers and organizations to find out if these patterns had any effect on the success of technological innovation. The objectives were to: (1) investigate the effects of communication on technological innovation at an individual level, and (2) study the effects of interorganizational communication on technological innovation.

## 5. User Involvement and MIS Success: A Review of Research
### Author(s):
- Blake Ives
- Margrethe H. Olson
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
User involvement in the design of computer-based information systems is enthusiastically endorsed in the prescriptive literature. However determining when and how much, or even if, user involvement is appropriate are questions that have received inadequate research attention. In this paper research that examines the link between user involvement and indicators of system success is reviewed. The authors find that much of the existing research is poorly grounded in theory and methodologically flawed; as a result, the benefits of user involvement have not been convincingly demonstrated. Until higher quality studies are completed intuition, experience, and unsubstantiated prescriptions will remain the practitioner's best guide to the determination of appropriate levels and types of user involvement; these will generally suggest that user involvement is appropriate for unstructured problems or when user acceptance is important.

## 6. A Budget Holdback Policy for Multi-Item Procurement Processes
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Morey
- Dennis J. Sweeney
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the development of an optimal budget holdback policy for a multi-item procurement process. An annual budget is made available for the purchase and resupply of n items. The issue is to determine how much of the budget to commit initially and how much to hold back for spot purchases later in the year. An analytic solution to the problem is developed for the single item case and compared to the unconstrained newsboy solution.

## 7. A Revision of the Power Approximation for Computing (s, S) Policies
### Author(s):
- Richard Ehrhardt
- Charles Mosier
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
A revision of the Power Approximation for computing (s, S) inventory policies is presented. The revision incorporates modifications which (1) ensure homgeneity in the units chosen to measure demand and (2) ensure the proper limiting behavior of S  s when the variance of demand is extremely small. Computational experience shows that the revision has operating characteristics that are typically within a few percent of optimal, which is nearly as accurate as the original Power Approximation.

## 8. Approximations for Superposition Arrival Processes in Queues
### Author(s):
- G. F. Newell
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
S. L. Albin has described extensive simulations of queue behavior for a system with a single server and an arrival process that is a superposition of n renewal processes. The simulations show, among other things, that as n increases for a fixed traffic intensity , the queue behavior approaches that of the M/M/1 system. The rate of convergence, however, becomes much slower as the traffic intensity  comes closer to 1. Several qualitative effects shown in the simulations are explained here. In particular it is shown that the approach to the M/M/1 system requires that n(1  )2  1.

## 9. A Note on the Room-Mates Problem and a Related Revenue Allocation Problem
### Author(s):
- Daniel Granot
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
We introduce in this note the consistent organizational structure (COS) problem, which can be viewed as a generalization of the college admission and room-mates problems. Both the room-mates problem and the COS problem may have no stable solution. When side payments are allowed, the COS problem, but not the room-mates problem, always has a nonempty core. We further study some nucleoli of the COS problem with side payments.

## 10. NoteOn the Single Machine Scheduling Problem with Quadratic Penalty Function of Completion Times: An Improved Branching Procedure
### Author(s):
- Sushil K. Gupta
- Tapan Sen
### Published:
- 1 May 1984
### Abstract:
This paper gives optimality conditions to obtain a priori precedence relationships among some of the jobs in a single machine scheduling problem so as to curtail the enumeration while using branch-and-bound technique. The objective is to minimize a quadratic (or generalized quadratic) penalty function of job completion times.

### Abstract:
This note provides a brief comparison between a three-dimensional layout planning system recently described in Management Science (Johnson [Johnson, Roger V. 1982. SPACECRAFT for multi-floor layout planning. Management Sci.28 (4, April) 407417.]) and a similar system developed earlier (Cinar [Cinar, Unver. 1975. Facilities planning: a systems analysis and space allocation approach. Charles M. Eastman, ed. Spatial Synthesis in Computer-Aided Building Design. Wiley, New York, 1940.]).
