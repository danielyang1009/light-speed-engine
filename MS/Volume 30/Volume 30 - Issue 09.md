## 1. An Empirical Test of Value-Based Planning Models and Implications
### Author(s):
- Carolyn Y. Woo
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
The value of the firm is clearly the central purpose of most entrepreneurial activities. Considering the scope, nature and impact of Strategic Management decisions, one would expect firm value to be an integral concern of this area. Yet seldom do we observe value being explicitly managed or systematically linked to the strategies and direction of the firm.

## 2. A Model of Venture Capitalist Investment Activity
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
The paper describes the activities of venture capitalists as an orderly process involving five sequential steps. These are (1) Deal Origination: The processes by which deals enter into consideration as investment prospects, (2) Deal Screening: A delineation of key policy variables which delimit investment prospects to a manageable few for in-depth evaluation, (3) Deal Evaluation: The assessment of perceived risk and expected return on the basis of a weighting of several characteristics of the prospective venture and the decision whether or not to invest as determined by the relative levels of perceived risk and expected return, (4) Deal Structuring: The negotiation of the price of the deal, namely the equity relinquished to the investor, and the covenants which limit the risk of the investor, (5) Post-Investment Activities: The assistance to the venture in the areas of recruiting key executives, strategic planning, locating expansion financing, and orchestrating a merger, acquisition or public offering. 41 venture capitalists provided data on a total of 90 deals which had received serious consideration in their firms. The questionnaire measured the mechanism of initial contact between venture capitalist and entrepreneur, the venture's industry, the stage of financing and product development, ratings of the venture on 23 characteristics, an assessment of the potential return and perceived risk, and the decision vis--vis whether to invest. The modal venture represented in the database was a start-up in the electronics industry with a production capability in place and seeking $1 million (median) in outside financing. There is a high degree of cross-referrals between venture capitalists, particularly for the purposes of locating co-investors. Factor analysis reduced the 23 characteristics of the deal to five underlying dimensions namely (1) Market Attractiveness (size, growth, and access to customers), (2) Product Differentiation (uniqueness, patents, technical edge, profit margin), (3) Managerial Capabilities (skills in marketing, management, finance and the references of the entrepreneur), (4) Environmental Threat Resistance (technology life cycle, barriers to competitive entry, insensitivity to business cycles and down-side risk protection), (5) Cash-Out Potential (future opportunities to realize capital gains by merger, acquisition or public offering). The results of regression analyses showed expected return to be determined by Market Attractiveness and Product Differentiation (R2 = 0.22). Perceived risk is determined by Managerial Capabilities and Environmental Threat Resistance (R2 = 0.33). Finally, a discriminant analysis correctly predicted, in 89.4% of the cases, whether or not a venture capitalist was willing to commit funds to the deal on the basis of the expected return and perceived risk. The reactions of seven venture capitalists who reviewed the model's specification were used to test its validity.

## 3. Inferring Preferences in Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Using a Logistic Regression Model
### Author(s):
- Theodor J. Stewart
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
A method is proposed for the analysis of multiple criteria decision making problems in an interactive environment, when decision-maker preferences are inconsistent with a simple utility model and/or are self-inconsistent (e.g., showing intransitivities). A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is invoked which is based on a logistic regression model relating the probability of selecting one decision option over another to a linear function of attribute values. The method is illustrated by application to multi-objective linear programming, where it serves as an alternative to the method of Zionts and Wallenius (Zionts, S., J. Wallenius. 1976. An interactive programming method for solving the multiple criteria problem. Management Sci.22 652663.), and allows for inconsistencies which are not satisfactorily handled in the Zionts-Wallenius approach.

## 4. Some Models for Estimating Technical and Scale Inefficiencies in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- R. D. Banker
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
In management contexts, mathematical programming is usually used to evaluate a collection of possible alternative courses of action en route to selecting one which is best. In this capacity, mathematical programming serves as a planning aid to management. Data Envelopment Analysis reverses this role and employs mathematical programming to obtain ex post facto evaluations of the relative efficiency of management accomplishments, however they may have been planned or executed. Mathematical programming is thereby extended for use as a tool for control and evaluation of past accomplishments as well as a tool to aid in planning future activities. The CCR ratio form introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, as part of their Data Envelopment Analysis approach, comprehends both technical and scale inefficiencies via the optimal value of the ratio form, as obtained directly from the data without requiring a priori specification of weights and/or explicit delineation of assumed functional forms of relations between inputs and outputs. A separation into technical and scale efficiencies is accomplished by the methods developed in this paper without altering the latter conditions for use of DEA directly on observational data. Technical inefficiencies are identified with failures to achieve best possible output levels and/or usage of excessive amounts of inputs. Methods for identifying and correcting the magnitudes of these inefficiencies, as supplied in prior work, are illustrated. In the present paper, a new separate variable is introduced which makes it possible to determine whether operations were conducted in regions of increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale (in multiple input and multiple output situations). The results are discussed and related not only to classical (single output) economics but also to more modern versions of economics which are identified with contestable market theories.

## 5. Sequencing Rules and Due-Date Assignments in a Job Shop
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
Recent research studies of job shop scheduling have begun to examine the interaction between sequencing priorities and the method of assigning due-dates. This paper surveys the tactical aspects of this interaction, focusing primarily on average tardiness as a measure of scheduling effectiveness. The discussion highlights several factors that can affect the performance of dispatching rules, such as the average flow allowance, the due-date assignment method, and the use of progress milestones. A set of simulation experiments illuminates how these factors interact with the dispatching rule, and the experimental results suggest which combinations are most effective in a scheduling system.

## 6. Joint Inventory Replenishments with Group Discounts Based on Invoice Value
### Author(s):
- Amiya K. Chakravarty
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
The study focuses attention on a grouping procedure for the purpose of joint inventory replenishments from a single supplier. The grouping procedure exploits the group discounts available on the total purchase value of a group of index and the economies of scale of order placing costs. In particular it is shown that the optimal groups are formed such that the annual (dollar) usage values of the items do not decrease (may increase or stay the same), from the first to the last group. This is similar in concept to the well-known ABC classification of inventory items. The grouping problem is modeled as a shortest-path using the above property.

## 7. Stochastic Models of Internal Mail Delivery Systems
### Author(s):
- Steven Nahmias
- Michael H. Rothkopf
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
This paper develops two stochastic models of an internal mail delivery system in which a single clerk picks up, sorts and delivers mail to a closed loop of offices. The two models differ in whether deliveries are made at scheduled times or not. For a model in which all mail picked up each round is sorted before the next delivery, we assume that mail is generated in the system by a stationary Poisson process and derive an expression for the expected delay between generation of a letter and its ultimate delivery. These results are then extended to systems in which letters are generated according to a stationary compound Poisson process and to multiple clerk delivery systems.

## 8. Approximation Methods for the Uncapacitated Dynamic Lot Size Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1984
### Abstract:
We provide worst case error bounds for several approximation methods (heuristics, product aggregation, and partitioning of the planning horizon) for the uncapacitated dynamic lot size problem. We propose two managerially oriented heuristics and show that they have a relative wont case error bound equal to two, and develop similar analyses for methods known as the least cost per unit heuristic, the part period balancing heuristic, and an economic order quantity heuristic (expressed in terms of a time supply of demand). We also show how errors introduced by partitioning of the planning horizon in multi-product multi-facility problems are bounded by product set-up costs, and how errors introduced by product aggregation are bounded by set-up costs, holding costs, and demands. The latter results suggest methods for product aggregation that minimize the worst case error bounds.
