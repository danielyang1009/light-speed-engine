### Abstract:
This paper concerns marginal cost pricing in a capacity expansion problem for the electric utility industry. We develop a characterization of equipment selection and marginal capital cost allocation based on an optimal capacity plan, in the context of either a finite, discretely distributed stochastic demand forecast, or in the deterministic case of multiple users identified by temporal considerations. In either case, a two stage linear program with recourse is shown to result. The main purpose of this paper is to conduct an analysis in order to determine a marginal cost pricing strategy for sharing capital costs given an optimal capacity plan, and to provide insightful economic interpretations. Our results also generalize a special case previously studied to demonstrate how a marginal cost pricing strategy may result in some of the capacity costs being borne by off-peak users.

## 2. The Groves Scheme, Profit Sharing and Moral Hazard
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
Considered in this paper is the problem of intrafirm resource allocation. Two incentive schemes, the Groves scheme and profit sharing, have been presented in the literature as ways of dealing with this problem under conditions of asymmetric information. In the absence of effort aversion by division managers, it has been shown that truth-telling forms a dominant strategy equilibrium using the Groves scheme and a Nash equilibrium using profit sharing.

## 3. Partitioning Variance in Regression Analyses for Developing Policy Impact Models: The Case of the Federal Medicaid Program
### Author(s):
- Milton M. Chen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
This paper extends the usual regression analysis to include the partition of the variance to examine the possible secondary and higher order impact of policy variables in a policy impact model. The federal Medicaid program is analyzed using the methodology to assess the impact of the policy variabledifferential federal matching ratioon the per capita expenditure from state and local sources. Our result shows that the policy is ineffectual on its own but modestly effective with others when all important factors are considered simultaneously.

## 4. A Lower Multinomial Bound for the Total Overstatement Error in Accounting Populations
### Author(s):
- Robert Plante
- John Neter
- Robert A. Leitch
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
A lower bound on the total error in an accounting population is required, in conjunction with the point estimate of the total error amount and the upper bound, when adjusting an account to determine the amount of the adjustment. This paper extends the multinomial methodology for obtaining an upper bound on the total overstatement (or understatement) error in an accounting population to the determination of a lower bound on the total overstatement (or understatement) error. The methodology for obtaining a lower multinomial bound differs in several important respects from that for obtaining an upper bound. The proposed lower bound may be computed for up to 25 errors in the sample and provides tighter limits than the widely used Stringer bound.

## 5. Queues in Which Customers Receive Simultaneous Service from a Random Number of Servers: A System Point Approach
### Author(s):
- Percy H. Brill
- Linda Green
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
We examine a multi-server queueing system with Poisson arrivals in which customers require simultaneous service from a random number of servers. Servers assigned to the same customer begin and end service concurrently. Service times are, in general, assumed to be exponentially distributed. A system point approach is presented as a framework for obtaining the waiting time distribution for each customer type. Explicit solutions are derived for the two-server system.

## 6. Approximations of Dynamic, Multilocation Production and Inventory Problems
### Author(s):
- Awi Federgruen
- Paul Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
Consider a central depot (or plant) which supplies several locations experiencing random demands. Orders are placed (or production is initiated) periodically by the depot. The order arrives after a fixed lead time, and is then allocated among the several locations. (The depot itself does not hold inventory.) The allocations are finally received at the demand points after another lag. Unfilled demand at each location is backordered. Linear costs are incurred at each location for holding inventory and for backorders. Also, costs are assessed for orders placed by the depot. The object is to minimize the expected total cost of the system over a finite number of time periods.

## 7. An Integer Programming Algorithm with Network Cuts for Solving the Assembly Line Balancing Problem
### Author(s):
- F. Brian Talbot
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
In this paper, we describe an integer programming algorithm for assigning tasks on an assembly line to work stations in such a way that the number of work stations is minimal for the rate of production desired. The procedure insures that no task is assigned to a work station before all tasks which technologically must be performed before it have been assigned (precedence restrictions are not violated), and that the total time required at each work station performing the tasks assigned to it does not exceed the time available (cycle time restrictions are not violated). The procedure is based on a systematic evaluation (enumeration) of all possible task assignments to work stations. Significant portions of the enumeration process are performed implicitly, however, by utilizing tests described in the paper which are based on the specific structure of the line balancing problem. An artifice termed a network cut is also developed which eliminates from explicit consideration the assignment of tasks to work stations where such assignments would not lead to improved line balances. Results reported demonstrate that the procedure can obtain optimal balances for assembly lines with between 50 and 100 tasks in a reasonable amount of computation time and with modest computer storage requirements.

## 8. The Dynamic Lot-Size Model with Stochastic Lead Times
### Author(s):
- Christopher Nevison
- Michael Burstein
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
Optimal solutions for the dynamic lot-sizing problem with deterministic demands but stochastic lead times are lumpy. If lead time distributions are arbitrary except that they are independent of order size and do not allow orders to cross in time, then each order in an optimal solution will exactly satisfy a consecutive sequence of demands, a natural extension of the classic results by Wagner and Whitin. If, on the other hand, orders can cross in time, then optimal solutions are still lumpy in the sense that each order will satisfy a set, not necessarily consecutive, of the demands. An example shows how this characterization can be used to find a solution to a problem where interdependence of lead times is critical. This characterization of optimal solutions facilitates dynamic programming approaches to this problem.

## 9. Thresholds and Transitivity in Stochastic Consumer Choice: A Multinomial Logit Analysis
### Author(s):
- S. K. Lioukas
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1984
### Abstract:
In previous work, thresholds have been introduced to describe situations where the consumer is indifferent between any two alternatives. Krishnan (Krishnan, K. S. 1977. Incorporating thresholds of indifference in probabilistic choice models. Management Sci.23 (July) 12241233.) formalised thresholds as minimum perceivable differences between the utilities of the alternatives compared and incorporated such thresholds into the binary logit model.
