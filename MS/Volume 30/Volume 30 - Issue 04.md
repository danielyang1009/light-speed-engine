## 1. Foundations of Risk Measurement. I. Risk As Probable Loss
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
This paper seeks to get behind specific contextual referents of risky situations to consider characteristics of risk that apply to many situations. It is guided by previous theoretical and empirical research in perceived risk, and focuses on the joint effects on risk of loss probability and the distribution of losses. The approach taken follows modern axiomatic theory by proposing conditions on a relation is at least as risky as between pairs of probability distributions over an outcome variable. Several sets of axioms for risk that characterize different forms for risk measurement are presented.

## 2. On Fates Comparable to Death
### Author(s):
- Ronald A. Howard
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Earlier models for the evaluation of assuming and shedding risks of death are extended to the case of possibly extreme disability over a lifetime. Earlier micromort values are supplemented with microdisability values to enable individuals to make consistent decisions in hazardous situations.

## 3. Survival versus Consumption
### Author(s):
- Donald S. Shepard
- Richard J. Zeckhauser
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
We develop an indirect method to estimate utility and willingness to pay (WTP) for reductions in the risk of death at various ages. Using a life-cycle model of consumption, we assume that an individual sets his consumption level each year so as to maximize his expected lifetime utility. Alternative assumptions about opportunities for borrowing and annuities characterize two polar types of societies. In our Robinson Crusoe case, an individual must be entirely self-sufficient, and annuities are not available. In our perfect markets case, an individual can borrow against future earnings and purchase actuarially fair annuities; we show that under these assumptions WTP is the sum of livelihood (discounted expected future earnings) and consumer surplus.

## 4. Risk Attitude and Time Preference in Health
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Risk attitude and time preference are well-known and distinct concepts in the study of individuals' preferences for goods such as money. This paper reviews and explores the application of these concepts to the field of health. A mathematical model is presented, both in a general form and in an exponential form, which relates an individual's risk attitude in health to three effectsa quantity effect, a gambling effect and a time preference effect. It is shown that the overall risk attitude, as measured by its direction and magnitude, is merely the sum of the individual effects, as measured by their directions and magnitudes. Measurement methods are presented which can be used in a given situation to determine which effects are operating, in what directions and with what magnitudes. A new measurement procedure based on the temporary palliation of a chronic condition is described as a method of obtaining an individual's time preference pattern for health.

## 5. A Perspective on Health and Safety Risk Analysis
### Author(s):
- Chauncey Starr
- Chris Whipple
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Health and safety risks are compared with financial risks, and the differences pertinent for risk evaluation and management are described. Such differences arise from the equities of risk distribution, the multiple stakeholders in the decision process, the opportunities for risk diversification, the interpretation of social values relating to risk choices, and in the political objectives in the decision process. Health and safety regulators are faced with the problem of making decisions involving large scientific uncertainties, public perceptions at odds with professional perceptions, uncertain and conflicting public values expressed through the political process, and difficult judgments of equity when risk and benefit are borne by different groups. The effect of highly publicized risk controversies on such regulatory decisions is described.

## 6. Modeling the Societal Impact of Fatal Accidents
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
A number of proposals have been put forth regarding the proper way to model the societal impact of fatal accidents. Most of these proposals are based on some form of utility function asserting that the social cost (or disutility) of N lives lost in a single accident is a function of N. A common view is that a single large accident is more serious than many small accidents producing the same number of fatalities, hence  > 1. Drawing upon a number of empirical studies, we argue that there is insufficient justification for using any function of N fatalities to model societal impacts. The inadequacy of such models is attributed, in part, to the fact that accidents are signals of future trouble. The societal impact of an accident is determined to an important degree by what it signifies or portends. An accident that causes little direct harm may have immense consequences if it increases the judged probability and seriousness of future accidents. We propose that models based solely on functions of N be abandoned in favor of models that elaborate in detail the significant events and consequences likely to result from an accident.

## 7. A Decision-Process Perspective on Risk and Policy Analysis
### Author(s):

- James W. Vaupel
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Risk analysis and policy analysis can play important roles in facilitating the siting of potentially hazardous facilities if one recognizes the descriptive features of the decision process. The case of siting a liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in California illustrates the multi-party sequential nature of the process and the role that widely differing risk estimates play in fueling conflicts between stakeholders. Risk analysis does have a useful function in clarifying the nature of the potential losses, particularly if rules of evidence are instituted for evaluating different studies. Policy analysis can facilitate the negotiation process by the use of compensation to redistribute gains and losses between the different parties. Examples from case studies are presented to illustrate the challenges for risk analysis and policy analysis in the siting process.

## 8. Managing the Risks of the Automobile: A Study of a Swedish Car Manufacturer
### Author(s):
- Ola Svenson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Hazard management of the risks of human injury and death related to the automobile are described and exemplified by the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo. The study presents the Volvo units engaged in accident hazard management and their roles in the elaborate system of feedbacks (information, penalties and rewards) created by the company and society for maintaining a high level of automobile safety. Improvements are suggested although the overall quality of the accident hazard management process is considered quite good. Although the study is focused on the automobile industry, it should be regarded as part of a much-needed wider perspective on hazard management applying to other technologies and industries as well. In general, the following factors are considered important to high quality accident hazard management by companies and society: (1) Public concern about safety issues, (2) technological capacity and organizational tradition of safety engineering in the manufacturing company, (3) routines for announcing future proposed safety standards, e.g., US Federal Register, (4) laws enforcing a recall system, (5) annual vehicle inspections and (6) effective product liability laws.

## 9. Risks of Catastrophic Derailments Involving the Release of Hazardous Materials
### Author(s):
- Theodore S. Glickman
- Donald B. Rosenfield
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
Models are formulated and computed to assess the risks of hazardous materials releases in train derailments in terms of: the probability of any number of fatalities in an accident, the probability of any total number of fatalities from all the accidents in a year, and the frequency of accidents which result in any given number of fatalities. These functions are evaluated using data bases and analytical methods which provide estimates of exposure levels (traffic volumes, track conditions and population densities), spill occurrence and spill size probabilities, and fatal spill impacts (the size of the lethal area in any given accident scenario). Despite the sparsity of historical data, this methodology enables us to express the potential for catastrophic occurrences in quantitative terms, to compare these numbers with estimates of other risks, and to examine the effects of selective variations in the model inputs.

- Raymond A. Freeman
- Reuven R. Levary
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
A risk assessment was performed to assist in the evaluation of equipment improvements for a chemical storage facility. The risk assessment was accomplished through the use of several different methodologies e.g., fault tree analysis, event trees, and risk perspective techniques. The result of the study was a new alternative for a chemical storage facility. This new alternative eliminated the requirement for a large storage facility and reduced the capital project cost by over 10 million dollars.

- Rakesh K. Sarin
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1984
### Abstract:
A risk assessment model is developed to relate adverse health effects to alternative carbon monoxide standards. The analysis requires information in the form of available data and expert judgments concerning factors such as ambient CO level, human exposure to CO, physiological responses, and dose-response relationships. Quantitative estimates, including probabilities, are obtained for selected summary measures of adverse health effects.
