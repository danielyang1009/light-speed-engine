## 1. A Multiple Dispatch Queueing Model of Police Patrol Operations
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
One of the primary concerns of urban police departments is the effective use of patrol cars. In large cities, police assigned to patrol cars typically account for more than 50% of total police manpower and their allocation has become particularly crucial in light of recent fiscal cutbacks.

## 2. A Comparison of the Multiple Dispatch and M/M/c Priority Queueing Models of Police Patrol
### Author(s):
- Linda Green
- Peter Kolesar
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
In many cities, a substantial fraction of calls for police service require more than one patrol car. We compare Green's multiple dispatch queueing model to several M/M/c-based approximations for multiple car dispatching that are obtained by adjusting the parameters. We found that none of the approximate models yields consistently reliable results under a broad range of conditions. The best approximations are produced by reducing the actual number of servers. Increasing the call rate gives the worst results.

## 3. Measuring Productive Efficiency: An Application to Illinois Strip Mines

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to apply a generalized version of the Farrell measure of technical efficiency to a sample of Illinois strip mines. We disaggregate the original Farrell measure (which was designed to measure lost output or wasted inputs due to underutilization of inputs) into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive components: (1) a measure of purely technical efficiency, (2) a measure of input congestion (overutilization of some input(s)) and (3) a measure of scale efficiency. This approach has the advantage that it provides additional information on the sources of inefficiency of production, which should be useful to managers, in general, not only in strip mining. Simple linear programming techniques are derived and used in calculating these efficiency measures for our sample. We find that Illinois strip mines are fairly efficient (relative to each other). The major source of inefficiency was due to deviations from the optimal scale of production. We also find suggestive evidence that inefficient mines tend to have relatively high stripping ratios, high labor-output ratios, single rather than multiple coal seams, and lower earth-moving capacity.

## 4. Organization Strategy and Structural Differences for Radical Versus Incremental Innovation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to test a model of the organizational innovation process that suggests that the strategy-structure causal sequence is differentiated by radical versus incremental innovation. That is, unique strategy and structure will be required for radical innovation, especially process adoption, while more traditional strategy and structure arrangements tend to support new product introduction and incremental process adoption. This differentiated theory is strongly supported by data from the food processing industry. Specifically, radical process and packaging adoption are significantly promoted by an aggressive technology policy and the concentration of technical specialists. Incremental process adoption and new product introduction tends to be promoted in large, complex, decentralized organizations that have market dominated growth strategies.

## 5. The Value of Market Share and the Product Life CycleA Game-Theoretic Model
### Author(s):
- Aneel Karnani
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
The paper presents a dynamic, game-theoretic model of marketing competition in an oligopoly. The equilibrium solution to this model is used to investigate how a firms optimal marketing expenditure per unit sold, which can be interpreted as a measure of the value of market share, depends on current and future market demand, which in turn can be related to the product life cycle. The results support and refine the conventional wisdom that the earlier it is the life cycle, the greater is the value of the market share.

## 6. Production Planning in Assembly Line Systems
### Author(s):
- R. Chandrasekaran
- Y. P. Aneja
- K. P. K. Nair
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
We develop a production planning model in the context of a system of assembly lines or production lines. The model is a large-scale linear program and we provide a polynomial column generation technique for its efficient solution. The column generation technique and the approach therein are also of interest in certain other problems. A numerical example to illustrate the algorithm is included. Finally computational experience with the algorithm is summarized.

## 7. A Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Vendor Profits
### Author(s):
- James P. Monahan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze how a supplier can structure the terms of an optimal quantity discount schedule. The vendor's challenge is to adjust his present pricing schedule to entice his major customer to increase his present order size by a factor of K. Optimal levels for K and the corresponding price discount are determined in order to maximize the supplier's incremental net profit and cash flow. Implementation issues are discussed and future research needs identified.

## 8. An Examination of Push-Pull Theory Applied to Process Innovation in Knowledge Work
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Zmud
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
Because many organizations have not been successful in introducing new task and managerial methods into the workplace, considerable attention has been directed toward developing a more complete understanding of organizational innovation. Three separate literatures (organizational science, engineering/R&D management, and MS/OR/MIS implementation) have, in fact, been concerned with innovation and technology diffusion; however, surprisingly little integration among the three has occurred. This paper reports on a study which examined a key tenet from each of these literatures in an effort to construct a robust model of innovative behavior. Specifically, the study utilized survey data in examining the validity of push-pull theory (i.e., that innovation is most likely to occur when a need and a means to resolve that need are simultaneously recognized) as well as the importance of top management attitude toward an innovation and of organizational receptivity toward change. The research context involved the diffusion of six modern software practices into 47 software development groups.

## 9. Priority Scheduling and Spares Stocking Policies for a Repair Shop: The Multiple Failure Case
### Author(s):
- Gary D. Scudder
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
Improved scheduling rules and spares stocking policies are examined for a repair shop supporting a multi-item repairable inventory system with a hierarchical product structure. The results from an earlier paper are extended to the case where more than one unit fails in each item to be repaired. A variety of scheduling rules and methods for initializing the vector of spare parts are evaluated using a simulation of a representative shop. The results indicate that procedures which perform well when only a single unit fails also perform well when multiple failures occur. More complex rules, which recognize assembly mating requirements, do not appear to provide any significant improvement.

## 10. A Distributed Parameter Cohort Personnel Planning Model That Uses Cross-Sectional Data
### Author(s):
- Cheryl Gaimon
- Gerald L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1984
### Abstract:
The two types of mathematical manpower planning models that appear in the literature involve either longitudinal or cross-sectional formulations. Despite the high degree of realism achieved, the use of longitudinal models is limited because the implementation requires the knowledge of a large amount of historical personnel data that is often unavailable. The value of cross-sectional models requiring a minimal amount of data is diminished due to (1) the difficulty in transferring cross-sectional results into cohort information, and (2) an assumption implicit in the structure of these models stating that the movement of an individual from one grade in the organization to another is independent of that person's organizational age.

### Published:

### Abstract:
In this Note, we address the issue of safety stock considerations in an MRP environment through the use of a single identical component as a replacement for a set of multiple components. We indicate where the results reported by Collier (Collier, David A. 1982. Aggregate safety stock levels and component part commonality. Management Sci.28 (11, November) 12961303.) may prove to be misleading.
