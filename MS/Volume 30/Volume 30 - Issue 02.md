## 1. Successful Information System Development in Relation to Situational Factors Which Affect Effective Communication Between MIS-Users and EDP-Specialists
### Author(s):
- B. De Brabander
- G. Thiers
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
The paper describes the results of an experimental test of a theoretical model which explains under what circumstances the interaction between MIS-users and EDP-specialists during the design of an information system will lead to success (i.e., efficient task-accomplishment). The research also includes an experiment about the influence of a third party playing different kinds of mediating roles. The results confirm the theoretical model. They are also corroborated by the findings in two case studies in a car-manufacturing firm, briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

## 2. Reducing Control Loss in Organizations: The Implications of Dual Hierarchies, Mentoring and Strengthening Vertical Dyadic Linkages
### Author(s):
- Martin G. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
Using Williamson's (1971) control loss model, the relative merits of dual hierarchies (P. B. Evans [Evans, P. B. 1975. Multiple hierarchies and organizational control. Admin. Sci. Quart.20 250259.), strong vertical dyadic linkages, and mentoring for reducing overall control loss are explored. The potential impact for each organizational structure or process is assessed.

## 3. The Effect of Presentation Form on the Use of Information in Annual Reports
### Author(s):
- Jan Bell
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
Information for management decisions is typically presented in both numeric and nonnumeric forms. This paper tests whether the choice of presentation form affects the use of such information by decision makers. Selected information from corporate annual reports was provided to a group of practicing financial analysts in a quasi-experimental setting. The analysts were asked to evaluate two companies (one R&D company and one manufacturing company) using selected financial data and excerpts from the presidents letter. Some versions of the letter contained numeric information while other versions contained nonnumeric information. The study tested several hypotheses which specified the conditions under which information in one presentation form would receive higher weight in a decision than the other form. Relative weights placed on different information forms were determined by an averaging model from information integration theory. The appendix contains a presentation of that model. The studys results suggest that when the link between organizational actions and future performance is not well established and understood, financial analysts may give more weight to nonnumeric information in evaluating a company. This study has important implications because it shows that in certain situations managers can influence financial analysts use of information by varying presentation form.

## 4. On the Reswitching and Convergence Properties of Research & Development Rivalry
### Author(s):
- Tom K. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
Under an alternate assumption of the payoff function, we analyze Lee's dynamic game model of R&D rivalry. Both similarities and differences in the equilibrium results of the model are obtained. It is shown that both the reswitching property and the convergence property of R&D rivalry are robust under the alternate assumption. The reswitching property of R&D rivalry states that after gaining a technological edge against a rival, a decision maker stops doing R&D and he will resume doing R&D when his rival succeeds in narrowing the technological gap between the two rivals. The convergence property of R&D rivalry states that when the technology levels of two rivals differ by a wide margin, the one with a lower technology level will be the only one doing R&D to narrow the technological gap between the two rivals. This formalizes the perception of R&D managers that the R&D decision of one firm should depend on the R&D decision of its rivals for competitive reasons. Moreover, when multiple Nash equilibria exist, a different pair of equilibria is obtained under the alternate assumption. Insights to an antitrust puzzle relevant to managers are provided. Finally, this paper provides an explanation of why the market shares of firms in an industry may differ. At stationary states of technologies, asymmetric technologies (market shares) are expected.

## 5. An Urban Allocation Model Combining Time Series and Analytic Hierarchical Methods
### Author(s):
- Thomas Cook
- Paul Falchi
- Reynaldo Mariano
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
Presented is a new application in urban economic forecasting. This method actively utilizes external information for household population forecasts. The purpose is to develop a more satisfying procedure as part of the management decision taking system. In the Portland Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), both time series and cross-sectional data are exploited. A transfer function-noise model is developed relating national output to SMSA employment. Household population for the SMSA is forecast utilizing the same statistical technique via a job opportunities/migration hypothesis. Forecasts are allocated to planning divisions within the SMSA by univariate stochastic models. However, these forecasts are adjusted after consideration of several land use indicators. The forecast standard errors are utilized and a hierarchical weighting scheme of the land-use indicators is developed within an allocation framework. Qualitative and quantitative information is merged to provide a more complete analysis and efficient estimates of the allocation weights.

## 6. Factor Screening in Simulation: Evaluation of Two Strategies Based on Random Balance Sampling
### Author(s):
- Carl A. Mauro
- Dennis E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
In the study of large, complex computer simulation models the user is often overwhelmed by the vast number of input variables. Moreover, he or she is usually confused about how to make an effective analysis of the model without performing an excessive number of runs, which tend to be costly and time consuming. Factor screening methods, which attempt to identify the more important variables, can be extremely useful in the study of such models. This paper presents and evaluates two screening strategies based upon random balance sampling. Both strategies are applicable when there are more variables to be screened than there are available screening runs. The results provide guidance in using these strategies in particular screening applications.

## 7. Computationally Efficient Optimal Solutions to the Lot-Sizing Problem in Multistage Assembly Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
The scheduling of lot sizes in multistage production environments is a fundamental problem in many Material Requirements Planning Systems. Many heuristics have been suggested for this problem with varying degrees of success. Research to date on obtaining optimal solutions has been limited to small problems. This paper presents a new formulation of the lot-sizing problem in multistage assembly systems which leads to an effective optimization algorithm for the problem. The problem is reformulated in terms of echelon stock which simplifies its decomposition by a Lagrangean relaxation method. A Branch and Bound algorithm which uses the bounds obtained by the relaxation was developed and tested. Computational results are reported on 120 randomly generated problems involving up to 50 items in 15 stages and up to 18 time periods in the planning horizon.

## 8. A Lot-Sizing Algorithm for Reducing Nervousness in MRP Systems
### Author(s):
- Dean H. Kropp
- Robert C. Carlson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
Previous work dealt with the problems of nervousness in Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Systems when production schedules were modified to include setups which previously had not been scheduled. In this work we further examine nervousness and its cost. By modifying the setup costs used in the Wagner-Whitin algorithm, we develop a generalized solution methodology for dealing with situations in which new setups are added to the production schedule and existing setups are cancelled.

## 9. Log Bucking and Lumber Manufacturing Using Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Bruce Faaland
- David Briggs
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1984
### Abstract:
The process of converting a tree into finished lumber involves several interrelated steps. The two of greatest potential for improvement are cutting the felled tree into shorter logs (called bucking the tree) and sawing the bucked logs into lumber. Unlike previous work in the area, this paper considers the two activities together as a single production system. The model allows for variations in tree shape and quality which could be recorded by modern electronic scanners. Among the principal techniques used in the paper are dynamic programming for both bucking and sawing, and a procedure for calculating the distance between two polyhedral sets in R2. Computational experience is reported on trees with representative defect patterns, taper, and sweep.
