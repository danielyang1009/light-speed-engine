## 1. An Overview of Techniques for Solving Multiobjective Mathematical Programs
### Author(s):
- Gerald W. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
Multiobjective mathematical programming has been one of the fastest growing areas of OR/MS during the last 15 years. This paper presents:
some reasons for the rapidly growing increase in interest in multiobjective mathematical programming,
a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the three general approaches (articulation of the decision maker's preference structure over the multiple objectives prior to, during, or after the optimization) towards multiobjective mathematical programming,
a nontechnical overview of many of the specific solution techniques for multiobjective mathematical programming, and
a discussion of important areas for further research.

## 2. State of the ArtUtility Assessment Methods
### Author(s):
- Peter H. Farquhar
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
This paper is a comprehensive study of methods for assessing unidimensional expected utility functions. The paper describes the utility assessment process in decision analysis and then reviews problem formulation, sources of bias in preference judgments, and the analysis of risk attitudes. Two dozen utility assessment methods of which half appear for the first time are critically examined. These methods are grouped into preference comparison methods, probability equivalence methods, value equivalence methods, certainty equivalence methods, hybrid methods, paired-gamble methods, and other approaches. The paper emphasizes the nature of judgmental biases in comparing different assessment procedures. Since most multiattribute utility functions are decomposed into single-attribute functions, this study should facilitate such applications. The paper concludes with several directions for further developmental, empirical, and applied research.

## 3. Multiattribute Nonlinear Utility Theory
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
Independence axioms similar to those proposed for multiattribute von NeumannMorgenstern linear utility theory are examined in the context of new nonlinear utility theories developed by Chew and MacCrimmon, and Fishburn. These new theories weaken the independence axiom of von Neumann and Morgenstern, and Fishburn's theory does not require preferences to be transitive. The paper shows that axioms for independence between attributes lead to decompositions of utility for the nonlinear theories that are related to standard decompositions for linear utility.

## 4. Stochastic Dominance Decision Rules when the Attributes are Utility Independent
### Author(s):
- K. C. Mosler
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
In multivariate decisions under risk, assessing the complete utility function can be a major obstacle. Decision rules are investigated which characterize uniformly better alternatives with respect to a whole class of utility functions. In this paper independence assumptions are imposed on the preference structure while the levels of attributes may be stochastically dependent in an arbitrary way.

## 6. Solving the Discrete Multiple Criteria Problem using Convex Cones
### Author(s):
- Pekka Korhonen
- Jyrki Wallenius
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
An interactive method employing pairwise comparisons of attainable solutions is developed for solving the discrete, deterministic multiple criteria problem assuming a single decision maker who has an implicit quasi-concave increasing utility (or value) function. The method chooses an arbitrary set of positive multipliers to generate a proxy composite linear objective function which is then maximized over the set of solutions. The maximizing solution is compared with several solutions using pairwise judgments asked of the decision maker. Responses are used to eliminate alternatives using convex cones based on expressed preferences, and then a new set of weights is found that satisfies the indicated preferences. The requisite theory and proofs as well as a detailed numerical example are included. In addition, the results of some computational experiments to test the effectiveness of the method are described.

## 7. On Efficient Solutions to Multiple Objective Mathematical Programs
### Author(s):

- R. E. Wendell
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
This note develops properties of quasi-efficient solutions and explores interrelationships to the classical concept of efficiency. In particular, a point is a quasi-efficient solution to a multiple objective mathematical program if and only if it is an optimal solution to a scalar maximum problem for some set of nonnegative weights on the objectives. This result is then used to characterize the set of quasi-efficient solutions as the union of efficient solutions to a multiple objective problem over all nonempty subsets of the objectives.

## 8. Multiattribute Risky Choice Behavior: The Editing of Complex Prospects
### Author(s):
- John W. Payne
- Dan J. Laughhunn
- Roy Crum
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
This investigation draws upon concepts from prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky [Kahneman, D., A. Tversky. 1979. Prospect theory: an analysis of decisions under risk. Econometrica47 263291.]) and multiattribute utility theory (Keeney and Raiffa [Keeney, R. L., H. Raiffa. 1976. Decisions with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value Tradeoffs. Wiley, New York.]) in an examination of the multiattribute risky choice behavior of 128 managers. The questions of how managers edit multiattribute prospects and how editing relates to various independence assumptions were explored. The major result is that managers appear to violate attribute independence in its general form, and especially in the form of the marginality assumption. The most common form of behavior observed was multiattribute risk aversion for prospects involving only gains and multiattribute risk seeking for prospects involving only losses. This result reinforces the importance of a target, reference point, or aspiration level that has been found in earlier studies of single attribute risky choice. Furthermore, the result casts doubt on such commonly used multiattribute utility functions as the additive, multiplicative, and multilinear forms. The implications of the results for the development of multiattribute risky decision aids are discussed.

## 9. Topological and Computational Aspects of Preemptive Multicriteria Military Personnel Assignment Problems
### Author(s):
- Darwin Klingman
- Nancy V. Phillips
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
This paper first presents a brief reveiw of the multicriteria problems faced by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps in making enlisted personnel assignment decisions. Then for the most complex of these military assignment problems, the Marine Corps problem, a new modeling and solution approach is presented with computational results for a problem having eleven criteria and approximately 10,000 constraints and 780,000 variables.

## 10. Sausage Blending Using Multiple Objective Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Ralph E. Steuer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1984
### Abstract:
Single objective cost minimization linear programming models are used as computerized decision-aids in sausage manufacturing (hot dogs, bologna, salami, etc.). However, sausage blending is clearly a problem with multiple conflicting criteria (cost, color, fat, protein, moisture, etc.) Presented in this paper is a vector-maximum/filtering MOLP (multiple objective linear programming) methodology for use as an improved decision-making approach with single formula sausage blending problems.
