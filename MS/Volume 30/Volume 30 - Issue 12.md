## 1. Introduction Strategy for New Products with Positive and Negative Word-of-Mouth
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
Existing innovation diffusion models assume that individual experience with the product is always communicated positively through word-of-mouth. For certain innovations, however, this assumption is tenuous since communicators of the product experience may transfer favorable, unfavorable, or indifferent messages through word-of-mouth. This paper examines a diffusion model for products in which negative information plays a dominant role, discusses its implications for optimal advertising timing policy and presents an application to forecast attendance for the movie Gandhi in the Dallas area.

## 2. An Empirical Investigation of Success Strategies for Businesses Along the Product Life Cycle
### Author(s):
- R. A. Thietart

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
Since the introduction of the concept of the product life cycle (PLC) some decades ago a great deal has been written on the subject and several empirical studies have been conducted. However, empirical research to date is often limited in scope. It is oriented towards the analysis of the growth and saturation stages and focused primarily on the study of consumer goods. Furthermore, the application of the PLC concept in strategic planning is largely disappointing, the normative orientation of most of this literature being somewhat naive and misleading.

## 3. Application of Mathematical Programming to the Plywood Design and Manufacturing Problem
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Plywood manufacture includes two fundamental stages. The first is to peel or separate logs into veneer sheets of different thicknesses. The second is to assemble veneer sheets into finished plywood products. At the first stage a decision must be made as to the number of different veneer thicknesses to be peeled and what these thicknesses should be. At the second stage, choices must be made as to how these veneers will be assembled into final products to meet certain constraints while minimizing wood loss. These decisions present a fundamental management dilemma. Costs of peeling, drying, storage, handling, etc. can be reduced by decreasing the number of veneer thicknesses peeled. However, a reduced set of thickness options may make it infeasible to produce the variety of products demanded by the market or increase wood loss by requiring less efficient selection of thicknesses for assembly. In this paper the joint problem of veneer choice and plywood construction is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. A relatively simple optimal solution procedure is developed that exploits special problem structure. This procedure is examined on data from a British Columbia plywood mill. Restricted to the existing set of veneer thicknesses and plywood designs used by that mill, the procedure generated a solution that reduced wood loss by 79 percent, thereby increasing net revenue by 6.86 percent. Additional experiments were performed that examined the consequences of changing the number of veneer thicknesses used. Extensions are discussed that permit the consideration of more than one wood species.

## 4. Maximization of Labor Productivity Through Optimal Rest-Break Schedules
### Author(s):

- De Witt L. Sumners
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
This paper focuses upon the maximization of labor productivity through selection of the optimal number, duration, and placement of rest breaks. It is demonstrated that resolution of the limited validity associated with previous models leads to a mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation of this problem. Efficient analytic procedures are developed which allow solutions to be obtained in minutes using a hand-held calculator. Then, the characteristics, properties, and potential effectiveness of optimal solutions are examined through an illustration from an existing work environment. Issues relevant to the implementation of the models are presented in a summary of an initial experiment in which one of the models in this paper was used to select rest break policy. The results of this experiment indicated that the output achieved using the model's policy was 13% higher than the output achieved when the subjects used their own rest break policies. Several future research topics are also identified.

## 5. Experimental Evaluation of Variance Reduction Techniques for Queueing Simulation Using Generalized Concomitant Variables
### Author(s):
- J. R. Wilson
- A. A. B. Pritsker
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
In a companion paper we developed a unified scheme for using poststratified sampling and control variables to improve the efficiency of regenerative queueing simulations. We adapted these variance reduction techniques to the estimation methods of replication analysis and regenerative analysis by exploiting the asymptotic joint normality of certain standardized concomitant variables that are defined on each input process sampled during a queueing simulation. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of the reductions in point-estimator variance and confidence-interval width that can be achieved with each procedure in several closed and mixed machine-repair systems. For the analytically tractable model, nominal and actual confidence-interval coverage probabilities are also compared. Poststratification generally produced variance reductions ranging from 10% to 40% and confidence-interval reductions between 1% and 20%. The control-variates schemes yielded variance reductions ranging from 20% to 90% and confidence-interval reductions between 10% and 70%. In some instances where small sample sizes were used, the poststratification schemes produced confidence-interval width increases between 1% and 10%. With a small number of regenerative cycles, some loss of confidence-interval coverage was observed with both post-stratified and controlled regenerative analysis. When larger sample sizes were used, all of the estimation schemes yielded fairly consistent efficiency gains.

## 6. School TimetablingA Case in Large Binary Integer Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Arabinda Tripathy
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
A timetabling problem is formulated as a large integer linear programming problem in 0-1 variables. A solution method based on Lagrangean relaxation coupled with subgradient optimization is presented. The solution method also incorporates a branch and bound procedure which takes advantage of special ordered sets of variables. We present computational results for a large timetabling problem involving 900 subjects in a one-year graduate program.

## 7. Incomplete Information, High-Low Bidding and Public Information in First Price Auctions
### Author(s):
- Tom K. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
High-low bidding refers to auctions of a series of objects where for a subset of the auctioned objects one of two buyers bids high on some objects and low on others while the other buyer does the reverse. This paper shows that high-low bidding does not imply collusive behavior among buyers. In particular, through a formal modeling of a noncooperative game of information acquisition and bidding decisions, it shows that high-low bidding can be obtained. The paper also demonstrates that if the cost of information to a seller is less than the equilibrium joint expected information cost of the buyers, then it pays the seller to provide public information. Finally, if the provision of public information is not feasible but a seller can know whether buyers have acquired information, then it pays the seller to make known to the buyers and to pursue a policy that just prior to the start of an auction the seller will announce which buyer has acquired information.

## 8. Solving Generalized Networks
### Author(s):
- Gerald G. Brown
- Richard D. McBride
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
A complete, unified description is given of the design, implementation and use of a family of very fast and efficient large-scale minimum-cost (primal simplex) network programs. The class of capacitated generalized transshipment problems solved includes the capacitated and uncapacitated generalized transportation problems and the continuous generalized assignment problem, as well as the pure network flow models which are specializations of these problems. These formulations are used for a large number of diverse applications to determine how (or at what rate) flows through the arcs of a network can minimize total shipment costs. A generalized network problem can also be viewed as a linear program with at most two nonzero entries in each column of the constraint matrix; this property is exploited in the mathematical presentation with special emphasis on data structures for basis representation, basis manipulation, and pricing mechanisms. A literature review accompanies computational testing of promising ideas, and extensive experimentation is reported which has produced GENNET, an extremely efficient family of generalized network systems.

## 9. An Approach for Developing an Optimal Discount Pricing Policy
### Author(s):
- Rajiv Lal
- Richard Staelin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of why and how a seller should develop a discount pricing structure even if such a pricing structure does not alter ultimate demand. The situation modeled is most appropriate where the seller's product does not represent a major component of the buyer's final product, where the demand for the product is derived, or where the price is only one of many factors considered in making a purchase decision. A model of buyer reaction to any given pricing scheme is developed to show that there exists a unified pricing policy which motivates the buyer to increase its ordering quantity per order, thereby reducing the joint (buyer and seller) ordering and holding costs. As a result, the seller is able to reduce its costs while leaving the buyer no worse off and often better off. The model is extended to handle variable ordering and shipping costs and situations where the seller faces numerous groups of buyers, each having different ordering policies. Finally a case study is presented explicitly showing how the proposed pricing policy can be applied to the situation of a large seller selling to a number of different buyer groups.

## 10. Different Measures of Win Rate for Optimal Proportional Betting
### Author(s):
- Peter A. Griffin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1984
### Abstract:
It is well known that all betting systems applied to independent, repeated, and identically distributed trials will result in the same expected gain per average unit wagered as that which applies to a single trial. This paper develops the asymptotic and paradoxical manner in which that constant win rate is maintained for optimal proportional betting according to the Kelly criterion. The appropriateness of using this traditional measure of win rate for proportional betting is contrasted with that of various alternatives.
