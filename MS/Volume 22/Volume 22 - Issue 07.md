## 1. A Comprehensive Planning Model for Long-Range Academic Strategies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
In this paper we describe a multiperiod linear programming model designed to aid the administrator of a school in planning and decision-making for a five-year horizon. The technique of goal programming is employed to accommodate the multiplicity of goals and the marginal trade-offs inherent in such a process. The model includes faculty staffing goals, career constraints, teaching and course loads, tenure constraints and budget constraints. A weighted sum of the deviations from the staffing goals make up the objective function of the prototype model considered. Several methods of estimating the various parameters of the model are discussed, and the results of a small example are also discussed.

## 2. On the Concept of the Value of Information in Competitive Situations
### Author(s):
- Jean-Pierre Ponssard
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
In this paper a game theoretic model is used to extend information value theory, as developed in decision analysis, to competitive situations. One of the main differences between competitive and noncompetitive situations is that part of the environment (namely the competitors) may be modified as a result of experimentation in another part of the environment (nature). Hence, states of the world and actions may no more be independent. Nevertheless, we shall show how the classical concept may be generalized to cover competitive situations.

## 3. An Improved Long-Run Model for Multiple Warehouse Location
### Author(s):
- Dennis J. Sweeney
- Ronad L. Tatham
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
This paper proposes an improved model for solving the long-run multiple warehouse location problem. The approach used provides a synthesis of a mixed integer programming formulation for the single-period warehouse location model with a dynamic programming procedure for finding the optimal sequence of configurations over multiple periods. We show that only the Rt, best rank order solutions in any single period need be considered as candidates for inclusion in the optimal multi-period solution. Thus the computational feasibility of the dynamic programming procedure is enhanced by restricting the state space to these Rt best solutions. Computational results on the ranking procedure are presented, and a problem involving two plants, five warehouses, 15 customer zones, and five periods is solved to illustrate the application of the method.

## 4. Some Easy Postoptimality Analysis for Zero-One Programming
### Author(s):
- Christopher J. Piper
- Andris A. Zoltners
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
Some easy postoptimality analysis for zero-one programming is developed. First, a procedure is presented for obtaining a set K of 0-1 solutions whose objective function values are within a specified tolerance of the optimum. Then sufficiency conditions for K to contain the optimum of a revised problem are derived. Computational experience with a number of test problems indicates that K can be economically obtained and that the sufficiency tests provide a significant postoptimization capability.

## 5. The Use of the Nash Bargaining Model in Trajectory Selection
### Author(s):
- James Bonnardeaux
- Jean-Pierre Dolait
- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
This paper describes a study performed to investigate the use of the Nash Bargaining Model in the selection of a trajectory for the Mariner Jupiter/Saturn 1977 (MJS77) Project spacecraft in the vicinity of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn. This effort was exploratory in nature with the objective of evaluating the appropriateness of the approach. Although questions were raised regarding the use of the Nash concept of “fairness” as the design criterion and the practical interpretation of randomized outcomes, the results suggest that the model does have potential value as an aid in resolving complex mission design problems.

## 6. A Least Total Distance Facility Configuration Problem Involving Lattice Points
### Author(s):
- Albert W. Chan
- Richard L. Francis
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
The problem considered in this paper is to find a layout of a given number of identical facilities so that the total (or average) rectilinear distance between facilities is minimized. The potential locations for the facilities are lattice points in the plane, which are points whose coordinates are integers. A set of geometric properties and necessary conditions for an optimal layout configuration is derived. Based on a symmetry assumption, an implicit enumeration procedure is developed that will yield all optimal configurations together with the least total distance between facilities.

## 7. A Computational Algorithm for Multi-Contract Bidding Under Constraints
### Author(s):
- David Goodman
- Hans Baurmeister
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
This paper considers a multi-contract bidding situation in which the contracts are interrelated because of limited productive facilities and because of budgetary constraints. A dynamic programming model and computational algorithm are presented which derive a bidding strategy which maximizes total expected return from all contracts subject to the constraints. The computational algorithm is efficient in terms of storage capacity required and computation time.

## 8. On Risky Investments with Random Timing of Cash Returns and Fixed Planning Horizon
### Author(s):
- Stylianos Perrakis
- Izzet Sahin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
This paper provides a computational technique for the evaluation of the net present value (NPV) of an investment, in which the cash inflows occur at random time points and which terminates after a fixed time interval. The initial cash outlay is deterministic and the magnitudes of the cash inflows are nonnegative random variables with known distributions.

## 9. Control Schemes in Queueing Networks
### Author(s):
- A. Brandwajn
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1976
### Abstract:
We consider open and closed queueing networks consisting of a set of controlled service centers. The controlled service center contains an exponential server, a queue of delayed customers and a control switch between them. The switch position is a function (control function) of the service center state which provides a means of controlling the service rate by admitting or not users into the server's queue. We give the stationary probability distribution for a broad class of control functions. An application of these results to the expected queue lengths and the expected waiting times in a two-server closed network is also considered.
