## 1. The Value of Sequential Information
### Author(s):
- Allen C. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
In decision analysis we normally consider the value of information to be a constant against which the cost of information is compared. However, when it is possible to buy information sequentially, the value of information is not a constant. Rather, it is a function of the prices of the various pieces of information, or “observables.” When we are faced with a decision and learn one observable, this information not only helps us make the original decision, but also helps us decide if we should pay for more observables. For this reason, the first observable has a value above and beyond that which we would assign if there were no possibility of obtaining additional information. To decide whether or not to buy one observable we must know the prices of all the observables.

## 2. Multivariate Risk Aversion, Utility Independence and Separable Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Scott F. Richard
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
This paper concerns utility functions for more than one attribute. A new type of risk aversion found only in muitivariate utility functions is defined. Certain behavioral assumptions, which are necessary and sufficient for one of three forms of separable utility functions including the well-known additive form, are given. It is shown that only one of these separable forms, the “negative multiplicative form,” possesses this new type of risk aversion and in particular that the additive form does not.

## 3. Perception of Problem Constraints
### Author(s):
- Ronald N. Taylor
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
The problem solver's perception of elements in a problem-situation will influence the extent to which he recognizes a problem and the nature of the constraints he associates with the problem. Constraints represent the extent to which the problem is defined or specified and problem formulation takes place as constraints are adjusted. Through such mechanisms as psychological set and functional fixedness, the previous problem-solving experiences of an individual can shape the constraints he perceives for subsequent problems. His prior experiences can either facilitate (positive transfer) or inhibit (negative transfer) problem solving, depending in part on the structure of the problem. The constraints likely to be associated with the problems of varying degrees of structure are examined and suggestions are made for reformulating problems by adjusting these constraints.

## 4. Efficient Estimators for Simulated Queueing Systems
### Author(s):
- Averill M. Law
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider efficient estimators for simulated queueing systems. It is shown to be more efficient to estimate all of the usual first moment measures of performance from an estimate of mean delay in queue than to estimate them directly.

## 5. An Efficient One Dimensional Search Procedure
### Author(s):
- R. L. Fox
- L. S. Lasdon

- Margery Ratner
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
Many nonlinear programming algorithms utilize a one-dimensional search along directions generated by the algorithm. This paper describes a method for performing this search. The method finds 3 points which bracket the minimum, fits a quadratic through them to yield a fourth point, then fits successive cubics through 4 points, discarding one each time, until certain stop criteria are met. No gradient evaluations are required. Detailed flow charts of this procedure are given, and its performance is compared with that of 2 other algorithms. Eight test problems are used in this comparison, each solved using both exterior and interior penalty functions. The Davidon-Fleteher-Powell method is used to generate the search directions. Results show that the proposed procedure requires about 1/2 to 3/4 to the computer time of its nearest competitor, a procedure designed to be especially efficient when applied to penalty functions, and about 1/3 the time of the other competitor, the 2 point cubic search using derivatives.

## 7. The Multiperiod Location-Allocation Problem with Relocation of Facilities
### Author(s):
- George O. Wesolowsky
- William G. Truscott
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
A dynamic or multiperiod location-allocation formulation is developed from the static problem of locating G facilities among M possible sites to serve N demand points. This dynamic model provides a tool for analyzing tradeoffs among present values of static distribution costs in each period and costs of relocating facilities. The objective is to specify the plan for facility locations and relocations and for attendant allocations of demands which minimize these costs. Two methods of solution are presented. First, a mixed-integer programming approach is used to solve sample problems. From computational results reported for structurally-similar problems, it seems that efficient general purpose codes for this method would be capable of solving problems with at least 5 periods, 5 potential sites, and 15 demand points. The second method, dynamic programming, is capable of increasing the size of problems that are computationally feasible. The dynamic programming approach is quite attractive when the relative values of G and M restrict the state space to a manageable size and constraints on the extent of location changes in each period limit the number of alternate decisions. Possible extensions of the model and solution procedures are discussed.

## 8. Evaluation of University Professors' Research Performance
### Author(s):
- Lawrence R. Jauch
- William F. Glueck
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
The goal of this study was to compare systematically the multiple measures of research output, both objectively and subjectively, in order to identify those which are effective for evaluation of research professors. The study took place at the University of Missouri where a sample of 86 “hard” science professors pursuing funded research in 23 departments were evaluated.

## 9. Global Minimization in Nonconvex All-Quadratic Programming
### Author(s):
- Gary R. Reeves
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes a branch and bound algorithm for the global minimization of a quadratic objective function subject to quadratic constraints over a bounded interval. No assumptions are made regarding the convexity of either the objective or the constraints. The algorithm consists of three basic steps. First, a local minimum is identified. Next, an interval surrounding this point over which the point is global is determined and eliminated. This interval is determined using linear programming techniques. Finally, bounding convex envelope approximating problems are constructed and solved globally over any remaining intervals. Intervals with bounds greater than the best local minimum objective value are eliminated. Successive iterations of the algorithm take place over the current remaining interval with lowest bound. The algorithm terminates when all intervals have been eliminated. Convergence of the algorithm to a global minimum “within ϵ” in a finite number of iterations is demonstrated.

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
A new algorithm for solving the traffic assignment problem is presented. This is a primal-dual algorithm which utilizes a flow augmentation primal and a shortest path dual procedure. At each iteration a feasible solution is known together with a measure of “goodness” of the solution.

## 11. Nash Equilibrium Strategies for the Problem of Armament Race and Control
### Author(s):
- M. Simaan
- J. B. Cruz, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
The problem of modeling and “optimally controlling” an arms race situation between two nations is a very interesting application, of differential game theory. In this pacer, armament, buildup between two nations is modeled as a multistage game problem. The closed-loop Nash, strategy is suggested as a possible solution concept for this problem and it is shown that if the cost functions are quadratic, then the system together with its closed-loop Nash strategies will have the same structure as the well-known Richardson's model of arms race. Consequently, it is suggested that the coefficients in Richardson's model can be determined (or predicted) based on the solution of this multistage discrete game problem. A computational procedure based on the solution of a set of recursive equations is also presented. This type of analysis is not only useful for guiding the armament decision-making process of a nation in an arms race with another nation but also is helpful in assessing economic and military aids by a large nation to smaller nations in an arms race.

### Abstract:
This note proves that the only stationary GI/M/1/N queueing systems (i.e., systems having fixed waiting room capacity N(0 ≦ N ≦ ∞)) with renewal output are the M/M/1/0 and stable (traffic intensity < 1) M/M/1/∞ systems.

## 13. Note—A Note on Modeling the Relationship of Diminishing Returns to Media Overlap for the Media Planning Problem
### Author(s):
- Leonard M. Lodish
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
A recent article in Management Science by Zufryden [Zufryden, F. S. 1973. Media scheduling: A stochastic dynamic model approach. Management Sci.19 (12, August) 1395–1406.] describes a media selection and scheduling model which neglects to consider diminishing returns to repeated exposures at the individual level. This note illustrates the problem by example and cautions potential users to inaccuracies that would occur if the model were to be used in practice.

## 14. Examining the Pattern of Response Behavior in a Media Model
### Author(s):
- Fred S. Zufryden
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1975
### Abstract:
A note submitted to Management Science by Lodish [Lodish, L. M. 1975. A note on modelling the relationship of diminishing returns to media overlap for the media planning problem. Management Sci.22 (1, September) 111–116.] comments on a media model previously published in this journal [Zufryden, F. S. 1973. Media scheduling: a stochastic dynamic model approach. Management Sci.19 (16, August) 1305–1406.]. Here, in turn, comments are made on the Lodish note. Also, in contradiction to implications of the note, empirical examples based upon both hypothetical and actual media exposure data are given. These illustrate that the media model may in fact approximate aggregate response behavior quite well for the purpose of practical applications even though it does not explicitly consider individual audience overlap patterns.
