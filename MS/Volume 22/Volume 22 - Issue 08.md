## 1. A Stochastic Model of Persuasive Communication
### Author(s):
- V. Balachandran
- S. D. Deshmukh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
A source repeatedly communicates a message through a channel so as to persuade a decision-maker to take a favorable action. The decision-maker observes the environment, the message and his cumulative learning experience and stochastically goes through a sequence of information processing states before taking an action. The transient and the steady state components of this information processing behavior are modeled in the semi-Markov process framework. Given such behavior, the problem of optimal communication system design is considered, using different measures of effectiveness of the persuasion process. Applications to advertising, decentralized planning and organizational decision-making are indicated.

## 2. A Generalized Model for Automating Judgmental Decisions
### Author(s):
- Michael S. Parks
- Nicolai Siemens
- Hugh J. Watson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model that develops a concise representation of a decision making task with a fixed number of alternatives. The methodology relies upon a conceptual information processing system analogous to that employed by a novice decision maker during the evolution of his decision paradigms. The model requires only the specification of relevant input stimuli and a sample of stimuli-response relationships in order to develop a representation of the task. The resulting representation is in a form which allows a predicted decision to be made given only the relevant stimuli. A mechanism is presented for efficiently operationalizing the task representation. An empirical study is presented which demonstrates the learning and performance capabilities of the model in the confines of an overdraft processing task.

## 3. Optimal Stock Depletion Policies with Stochastic Lives
### Author(s):
- S. Christian Albright
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the optimal issuing sequence of units, say batteries, from storage to the field when field lives are stochastic. Several appealing forms of the field life survival probability F̄(y∣x) are given when the battery has been on the shelf a length of time x. These forms are used to investigate the optimally of LIFO (issue youngest) or FIFO (issue oldest) policies in two basic models. These models correspond to issuing batteries either according to a possibly random schedule (the independent case) or one after another as the successive batteries fail (the dependent case).

## 4. Fractional Programming. I, Duality
### Author(s):
- Siegfried Schaible
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
This paper, which is presented in two parts, is a contribution to the theory of fractional programming, i.e., maximization of quotients subject to constraints. In Part I a duality theory for linear and concave-convex fractional programs is developed and related to recent results by Bector, Craven-Mond, Jagannathan, Sharma-Swarup, et al. Basic duality theorems of linear, quadratic and convex programming are extended. In Part II Dinkelbach's algorithm solving fractional programs is considered. The rate of convergence as well as a priori and a posteriori error estimates are determined. In view of these results the stopping rule of the algorithm is changed. Also the starting rule is modified using duality as introduced in Part I. Furthermore a second algorithm is proposed. In contrast to Dinkelbach's procedure the rate of convergence is still controllable. Error estimates are obtained too.

## 5. Fractional Programming. II, On Dinkelbach's Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Siegfried Schaible
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
Dinkelbach's algorithm [Dinkelbach, W. 1967. On nonlinear fractional programming. Management Sci.13 492–498.] solving the parametric equivalent of a fractional program is investigated. It is shown that the algorithm converges superlinearly and often (locally) quadratically. A priori and a posteriori error estimates are derived. Using those estimates and duality as introduced in Part I, a revised version of the algorithm is proposed. In addition, a similar algorithm is presented where, in contrast to Dinkelbach's procedure, the rate of convergence is still controllable. Error estimates are derived also for this algorithm.

## 6. Multi-Commodity Multi-Transformed Network Flows with an Application to Residuals Management
### Author(s):
- D. Panagiotakopoulos
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
This paper presents a network model for the analysis of waste management systems. In the “waste management network” that we develop waste-generating activities correspond to sources, each node corresponds to a specific flow (waste) form, and each arc to a flow transformation; a chain from a source to a destination represents in turn waste generation, treatment, and disposal, while a feasible flow pattern constitutes a possible waste management system. The model resembles the maximal multi-commodity flow model with positive gains (single transformation) along the arcs, but in addition it admits multi-transformations, interrelations among arc flows, and flow-dependent budget restrictions. The problem is formulated as a linear program where each column in the constraint matrix corresponds to a chain in the network. The solution procedure uses a column-generation scheme based on a shortest route algorithm adapted for multi-transformed flows. Recycling, discharge and effluent standards, charges, damage costs and various budgeting schemes can be handled. An illustrative hypothetical example is given.

### Abstract:
This paper deals with some properties of a decentralized adjustment process which were investigated originally by T. A. Marschak in [Marschak, J. 1968. Computation in organizations: Comparison of price mechanisms and other adjustment processes. Risk and Uncertainty Proceedings of an International Economic Association Conference, Ch. XII. of McGuire, C. B., R. Radner (1972), eds. Borch and Mossin, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1972.]. We correct some mathematical errors.

## 8. Criteria for Market Segmentation Studies
### Author(s):
- Neil E. Beckwith
- Maurice W. Sasieni
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
Morrison recently claimed that models which attempt to explain differences in purchasing behavior in terms of the characteristics of individual purchasers should be expected to have low R2's. Here we generalize his stochastic model and also examine a slightly different stochastic model which is consistent with the usual regression segmentation studies. Correctly specified segmentation studies are shown to have higher R2's (roughly exceeding 0.5) than typically reported, indicating many previous segmentation studies are misspecified. We also show how to estimate the correlation between prediction and long run average behavior from short term observations.

## 9. Note—On Evaluating Market Segmentation Studies and the Properties of R2
### Author(s):
- Albert R. Wildt
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
In a recent paper (Management Science, Vol. 19, No. 11, pp. 1213–1221) Morrison presents an interesting and useful explanation relating to empirical studies in market segmentation and their marked failure in explaining much of the variance in individual purchasing behavior. The explanation centers around the fact that, while a model may be very effective in predicting the average number of purchases for a particular individual, it may be very poor in predicting the exact number of purchases for that individual during a specified time period. He proceeds to show that, under a given set of assumptions, the upper limit of the population R2 statistic for the models used in most empirical studies in this area is considerably less than 1.0. He further states that, in cases where the model explains less than 50% of the variance of the expected number of purchases for individuals, R2 (true population value) becomes negative. This conclusion is one which lacks intuitive appeal and deserves further consideration.

## 13. Note—Note on a Control Problem of Balachandran and Tijms
### Author(s):
- O. J. Boxma
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1976
### Abstract:
In this note a conjecture of Balachandran and Tijms [Balachandran, K. R., H. C. Tijms. 1975. On the D-policy for the M/G/1 queue. Management Sci.21 1073–1076.] concerning the optimality of the D-policy over the N-policy in an M/G/1 queueing system is proved, using an inequality for renewal functions. This inequality seems to have some importance of its own.
