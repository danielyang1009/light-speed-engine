### Published:

### Abstract:
This discussion demonstrates the application of discrete optimal control theory to production planning problems. In particular we show that most of the previous models which have appeared in the literature on production planning (scheduling, smoothing and work force balancing) can be characterized as special cases of the control theory problem formulation. This more general model relaxes a number of the assumptions required by other formulations in capturing a wide spectrum of production planning policies. Computational aspects of the control theory approach are discussed and solution results included for numerical examples.

## 2. Capacity Planning for Large Multilocation Systems: Approximate and Incomplete Dynamic Programming Approaches
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
Methods for planning capacity expansion typically have been restricted to problems with many locations in a static environment or a few locations in a dynamic environment. Two approaches are developed here for dynamic capacity planning problems with many locations. The first is an approximate approach based on an equivalent annual cost measure, and the second is a procedure for systematic improvement of the approximate solution. The method for improvement is called “incomplete dynamic programming” since it consists of an approximation to the first cycle of the dynamic programming policy iteration approach. Computational results are reported for tests of the methods against dynamic programming solutions for small problems. Applications are made to two versions of a large-scale problem of planning capacity expansion for India's nitrogenous fertilizer industry, and results are compared with those for other approaches.

## 3. The Design of Management Information Systems an Information Analysis Approach
### Author(s):
- William R. King
- David I. Cleland
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes a methodology for management information systems design which employs a formalized framework for significantly involving manager-users in the design process. The process seeks to develop a system design on the basis of a criterion which considers both technical cost-benefit considerations and the manager's perception of the potential utility of the system. A key element of the methodology is the development of descriptive and normative system models which are based on the concept of a “linear responsibility chart.” These models serve as the basis for the negotiated development of a consensus system model which defines the framework for the decision-oriented analysis of information requirement. The process of information analysis involves joint manager-analyst activities which are aimed at the explication of the implicit decision models which are used for decision making.

## 4. Manufacturing Cycle Time Determination for a Multi-Stage Economic Production Quantity Model
### Author(s):
- Andrew Z. Szendrovits
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model which treats the manufacturing cycle time as a function of the lot size in a multi-stage production system. Using this functional relationship to determine the magnitude of the work-in-process inventory, a model is developed to calculate the economic production quantity (EPQ). The model assumes that a uniform lot size is manufactured through several operations, with only one set-up at each stage, and that transportation of sub-batches allows an overlap between operations to reduce the manufacturing cycle time. Constant fixed costs per lot, linear inventory holding costs and a constant and continuous demand of finished products are assumed over an infinite horizon. The lot size is considered “economic” when the sum of the fixed costs per lot and the inventory holding costs of both the work-in-process and finished product inventories is minimized. The model is a valid alternative to the conventional production lot size (ELQ) model which only accounts for the finished product inventory. A cost sensitivity analysis reveals the large potential savings from using the suggested EPQ model instead of the conventional ELQ model in multi-stage production systems.

## 5. Sales Territory Design: An Integrated Approach
### Author(s):
- Roy J. Shanker
- Ronald E. Turner
- Andris A. Zoltners
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
A sales territory design procedure should solve the dual problems of boundary definition and call frequency. Furthermore, it should be possible to base the design on several workload and potential criteria. A procedure is presented which meets this specification. It employs recent developments in set-partitioning and includes a computer code which makes it possible to handle design problems of realistic proportions. The outcome of the design procedure, termed the market matrix, is a schedule which specifies which salesman calls on each customer, and the sales call frequencies which maximize the total sales from all territories. A case example illustrates how the procedure is applied.

## 6. Effective Comparison of Unconstrained Optimization Techniques
### Author(s):

- K. H. Phua
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
The paper presents a means of attempting to account for overhead, as well as function evaluations, in evaluating unconstrained optimization techniques. Criteria are established which compare techniques on classes of algorithms. While not completely machine independent, and certainly not programmer independent, the new method eliminates much of the machine dependency of earlier criteria. The criteria are applied to three known and one new quasi-Newton algorithm, with interesting results.

## 7. Capacity Expansion with Two Producing Regions and Concave Costs
### Author(s):
- C. O. Fong
- M. R. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
A deterministic capacity expansion and shipment planning problem is considered for a single commodity that can be produced in two regions. Demand in each region is nondecreasing over a finite time horizon. Demand in a region in a time period must be satisfied, either by the current production capacity there or by a shipment from the other region. Capacity expansion and shipment costs are assumed to be concave and no inventory of stock is allowed. The problem is to find a schedule of capacity expansion in each region and a schedule of shipment between the two regions, such that the total cost over the time horizon is minimized. To solve this problem a dynamic programming algorithm is devised that is more efficient than known conventional procedures.

## 8. Exceptional Paper—Probability Encoding in Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- Carl S. Spetzler
- Carl-Axel S. Staël Von Holstein
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
This paper presents the present philosophy and practice used in probability encoding by the Decision Analysis Group at Stanford Research Institute. Probability encoding, the process of extracting and quantifying individual judgment about uncertain quantities, is one of the major functions required in the performance of decision analysis. The paper discusses the setting of the encoding process, including the use of sensitivity analyses to identify crucial state variables for which extensive encoding procedures are appropriate. The importance of balancing modeling and encoding techniques is emphasized and examples of biases and unconscious modes of judgment are reviewed. A variety of encoding methods are presented and their applicability is discussed. The authors recommend and describe a structured interview process that utilizes a trained interviewer and a number of techniques designed to reduce biases and aid in the quantification of judgment.

## 9. Information and Decision Systems for Production Planning
### Author(s):
- Herbert Moskowitz
- Jeffrey G. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
Bowman [Bowman, E. H. 1963. Consistency and optimality in Managerial decision making. Management Sci.9 (2) 310–322.] and others have proposed that regression models derived from a manager's past behavior can serve as a basis for future managerial decisions. This paper is concerned with a comparison of this approach to more traditional modes of decision making (intuition and mathematical optimization models) in an aggregate production scheduling context under various forecast error and forecast horizon environments. The regression models developed were also used to test Bowman's “Management Coefficients” theory at the axiomatic level, as well as to examine intuitive decision processes. To do this required verification that the regression models accurately specified an individual's decision process. A verification procedure, based on the concept of predictive testing, was used conjointly with statistical goodness of fit and cross validation to validate the regression models. The experimental results (1) supported Bowman's hypotheses, and (2) indicated the effects of forecast error and horizon length on the performance of the three decision making modes and on the formation of intuitive scheduling strategies. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

### Author(s):
- G. Gregory
- C. D. Litton
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
An approach is presented for the solution of the discrete conveyor model for service time distributions which are general but bounded and where there is no storage at work stations and no recirculation. The model is described by states with the Markovian property and solutions may be derived for moderately sized numbers of operatives.

## 11. Comparative Evaluation of Two Sets of Social Indicators
### Author(s):
- Emil E. Malizia
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
An earlier and a subsequent study which constructed two sets of social indicators for Charlotte, N.C. during the past two years are here examined and compared as part of an effort directed to the development of a general methodological approach for synthesizing and selecting between various indicators at local government levels. Five measurement tests are used to compare the two sets. The tests are based upon two criteria: correspondence and correctness. Four tests apply the former criterion; one test applies the latter. Although the results show the superiority of the more recent study, the more essential purpose is to illustrate a potentially useful approach to evaluating social indicators which is independent of the local public policy making process and is amenable to computerization. Although many of the tests employed cannot be brought to a completely satisfactory resolution at the present moment, the evaluation methodology can be regarded as a start toward a needed approach to assist systems analysts and local officials concerned with municipal information systems in constructing more reliable and accurate social indicators.

## 12. An Alternate Approach to Indicator Development
### Author(s):
- Michael J. Flax
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
In the previous paper Professor Malizia develops two tests (“correspondedness” and “correctness”) and uses them for comparing two sets of indicators. He seeks an “evaluation methodology which is ‘objective’ in that it does not depend upon the attitudes of managers or public officials.” Here, a different approach to the problem of evaluating or designing indicators is suggested. Rather than attempting to design multi-purpose indicators, one might deliberately seek to match indicator specifications systematically to the requirements of different managers and public officials. The crucial technical refinements of data definition and measurement precision can then be undertaken in the context of a knowledge of the eventual usage of the indicators being developed.

## 13. Note—Note on “Determination of Optimum Packaging Frequency of Items Jointly Replenished”
### Author(s):
- S. K. Goyal
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1975
### Abstract:
In my paper [Goyal, S. K. 1974. Determination of optimum packaging frequency of items jointly replenished. Management Sci.21 (4, December) 436–443.], an algorithm is given for determining the optimum packaging frequency of jointly replenished items. Essentially the procedure involves determining the lower bound and upper bound for the frequency of manufacturing set-ups and then choosing the optimum policy which provide minimum cost from a limited number of policies within the lower bound and upper bound of the manufacturing frequency. The effectiveness of the algorithm can be improved by redefining the upper bound of the manufacturing frequency and modifying a step of the original algorithm.
