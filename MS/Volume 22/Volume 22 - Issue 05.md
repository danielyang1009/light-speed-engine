## 1. On the Management Science Ten Page Constraint
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
In December 1971, a ten page constraint was instituted for most papers published in Management Science. The implications of this page constraint policy are examined, and a modified policy is proposed which retains all of the advantages of the current policy while eliminating some of its disadvantages.

## 2. Optimizing the Procurement of Aviation Fuels
### Author(s):
- Larry M. Austin
- William W. Hogan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
Defense Department requirements for aviation fuels are met with purchases made in the usual competitive bidding environment. This large-scale contract bidding and selection problem is modeled as a mixed integer linear program with a special structure. The solution of this large optimization problem is approached via an algorithm employing decomposition and implicit enumeration techniques which exploit the special structure of the underlying formulation. Computational results and other considerations are discussed.

## 3. A Balance Model for Evaluating Subsets of Multiattributed Items
### Author(s):
- Peter H. Farquhar

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
There are numerous situations in management and elsewhere in which an individual decision maker chooses subsets of multiattributed items. The specification of a measure of goodness for selecting subsets may differ from one situation to the next. In this paper, a model is developed for evaluating subsets where the choice criterion is one of balance among the attributes of items in the subset chosen. A method for determining the parameters of the model from a small number of judgments on subsets using linear programming is discussed. The model is applied to the problem of evaluating subsets of television shows and of choosing the most balanced subset of shows. Several extensions of the model and potential applications are also given.

## 4. An Application of Queueing Theory to Reservation Newtorks
### Author(s):
- M. F. Driscoll
- N. A. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the modeling and solution of a reservation network problem. The model is presented in terms of motel reservations, but is applicable to reservation systems for airlines, automobile rental agencies, etc. The network studied employs three methods for delivery of reservation messages, two of which serve jointly as a control mechanism. The problem solved is that of finding minimum rates for the control mechanism which ensure that, with a given probability, messages are delivered within a specified period of time.

## 5. Modeling for the Management of Library Collections
### Author(s):
- Bani K. Sinha
- Richard C. Clelland
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general model for approaching the problem of control of the active collection of a library through the acquisition and weeding processes. It assumes that age of book and size of holding are important in this process and recognizes constraints related to shelf space and the acquisitions budget. It then discusses three special cases of the model with shelf space the binding constraint as well as certain empirical work that tends to support a negative exponential form for demand as a function of age.

## 6. A Simulation Study of Alternative Pollution Control Enforcement Systems
### Author(s):
- Paul B. Downing
- William D. Watson, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
Simulation analysis is used to investigate enforcement of the new source performance standard for particulate matter discharges from coal-fired power plants. The analysis uses engineering and econometric estimates of relevant cost and performance paramenters. Results are generalized by Monte Carlo selection over distributions of each of the appropriate parameter values. The simulations are summarized through regression analysis on the outcomes.

## 7. Input Policies for a Longitudinal Manpower Flow Model
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
This paper formulates a general longitudinal manpower flow model and poses the problem of scheduling the inflow of manpower for an infinite number of periods subject to constraints on the stocks and inflows of manpower and the size of the manpower system. The objective is to minimize the present value of the costs of system operation. A finite linear program is introduced which can calculate a lower bound on the optimal value of the infinite problem. The optimal solution of the finite linear program can be used to construct a sound and easily implemented policy for the infinite problem.

## 8. Line Search Techniques Based on Interpolating Polynomials using Function Values Only
### Author(s):
- Arie Tamir
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
In this study we derive the order of convergence of some line search techniques based on fitting polynomials; using function values only. It is shown that the order of convergence increases with the degree of the polynomial. If viewed as a sequence, the orders approach the Golden Section Ratio when the degree of the polynomial tends to infinity.

### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
An algorithm with three variations is presented for the approximate solution of fixed charge problems. Computational experience shows it to be extremely fast and to yield very good solutions.

## 10. Scheduling of Work Forces Required in Continuous Operations Under Alternative Labor Policies
### Author(s):
- William S. Brownell
- James M. Lowerre
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
For a seven day a week operation in which N employees are needed on each weekday and n on each weekend day, with N at least as large as n, the effects of time-off policies on the size of the work force are studied. The simplest time-off schedule considered is one in which each employee has two days off out of the week. The most complicated is the policy under which each employee gets even other weekend off, four days off in each two weeks, and all days off in two-day blocks. After the minimum necessary work force has been determined for a policy, it is then shown how any work force meeting the requirement can actually be scheduled.

## 11. A Hybrid Algorithm for the Computation of Fixed Points
### Author(s):
- C. B. Garcia
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
Given a continuous mapping of a simplex to itself, an algorithm is shown that generates an infinite sequence of points converging to a fixed point of the mapping. Taking advantage of a generalization of Sperners lemma, the proposed method generalizes those of Scarf and Eaves in a manner such that both methods are given a unifying formulation.

## 12. Noteâ€”One-Dimensional Facility Location-Allocation using Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Love
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1976
### Abstract:
A dynamic programming algorithm is presented to locate m variable facilities in relation to n existing facilities situated on one route. Each of the n existing facilities has a requirement flow which must be supplied by the variable facilities. The algorithm does the allocation simultaneously with the location. Computational experience indicates that relatively large problems may be solved optimally.
