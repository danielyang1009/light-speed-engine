## 1. A Methodology for Determining the Optimal Design of a Free Standing Abortion Clinic
### Author(s):
- Howard S. Gitlow
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
In 1970, abortion on demand was legalized in several sections of the United States. Due to increased demand for abortions, free standing abortion clinics came into existence. This paper develops a methodology for determining the optimal design of a free standing abortion clinic, in order to maximize its profits. An example of a clinic which was actually designed employing the methodology is presented, and the results suggest that the methodology is relevant and useful.

## 2. A Forest Management Planning Model Integrating Silvicultural and Transportation Activities
### Author(s):
- Andres Weintraub
- Daniel Navon
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of integrating the analysis of timber management, forest road building and maintenance, and transporting logs. The aim of such analysis is to provide tools for the decisionmaking process in long-range forest planning. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to maximize discounted revenues from the sale of timber net of road construction and maintenance, timber management, and transport costs. The main complexity of this model, which precludes a straightforward formulation, arises from the need to gain access to an area before it can be managed. Artificial variables and relations are introduced to avoid an unmanageably large number of 0-1 integer variables.

## 3. Allocating Building Inspection Manpower for Fire Prevention
### Author(s):
- David M. Miller
- David E. Fyffe
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper concerns the analysis of two basic planning problems inherent in the building inspection operations of municipal fire prevention bureas. These problems are (1) how often to inspect each type occupancy in each area of the city, and (2) how to divide the city into “area-of-responsibility” districts, with one district for each inspector. The problems are interrelated and are represented in one model. Formulation of the model is based on the operations of the Atlanta, Georgia, Fire Prevention Bureau. The model constitutes a “controllable” analogue to the political redistricting problem. A solution procedure is presented which is a modification of the Hess and Weaver redistricting algorithm. Application of the model and solution procedure to Atlanta is given. Preliminary results indicate an improvement in districting over current practices.

## 4. Stochastic Cash Management with Fixed and Proportional Transaction Costs
### Author(s):
- George M. Constantinides
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
A continuous time model of cash management is formulated with stochastic demand and allowing for positive and negative cash balances. The form of the optimal policy is assumed to be of a simple form (d, D, U, u). The parameters of the optimal policy are explicitly evaluated and the properties of the system are discussed.

## 5. An Integrated Optimization/Information System for Academic Departmental Planning
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer
- John M. Mulvey
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper describes the integration of a network optimization algorithm with a decision and information system for the Graduate School of Management at UCLA. This optimization algorithm plays an important role in the determination of the annual teaching schedule by assigning faculty to courses and other activities on the basis of their responses to course preference questionnaires. In addition, the network structure provides an ideal framework for a compact information system for the department. The system can also provide some assistance in determining faculty recruiting priorities or in studying the impacts of changes in student enrollments. Our actual experiences in implementing and using this system are described.

## 6. A Problem in Single-Machine Sequencing with Nonlinear Delay Costs
### Author(s):
- Peter B. Henderson
- Kenneth Steiglitz
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
We examine a class of single-machine sequencing problems which originate from scheduling considerations for a single-server queueing system with nonlinear costs of delay. Associated with each request awaiting service (sequencing) are a known service time, a known arrival time, and a nondecreasing cost function which is identical for each request. Two sequencing problems are considered; a request incurs cost from its arrival time to the time when it (1) commences service or (2) completes service. Our objective is a sequence which minimizes the total incurred cost.

## 7. A Simple Method of Determining Order Quantities in Joint Replenishments Under Deterministic Demand
### Author(s):
- Edward A. Silver
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
We consider the situation of a family of items sharing a common supplier or common production facility. There is a major setup (header) cost to make a replenishment of the family and a minor (line) cost for each item included in the replenishment. In such a setting it makes sense to coordinate replenishments of the various items of a family. Under the assumption of deterministic demand, several authors have suggested iterative solutions which are not necessarily guaranteed to be optimal, yet are not easy to implement. We present an alternative procedure which is extremely simple to use, yet appears to have rather small cost penalties in relation to the earlier more sophisticated methods.

## 8. A Simulation Study of Operating Policies in a Hypothetical Dual-Constrained Job Shop
### Author(s):
- James K. Weeks
- John S. Fryer
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation study of the relative impact of due-date assignment, dispatching and labor assignment decision rules on the performance of a hypothetical dual-constrained job shop. Six criteria are used to measure the performance of the decision rules. They are mean flow-time, variance of flow-time, mean lateness, variance of lateness, proportion of jobs late, and total labor transfers.

## 9. Heuristic Methods for Telephone Operator Shift Scheduling: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):
- Willie B. Henderson
- William L. Berry
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
Heuristic methods are presented for scheduling telephone traffic exchange operators to meet demand that varies over a 24-hour operating period. Two types of heuristics are described (1) for determining the work shift types to be considered in preparing an operator shift schedule and (2) for constructing an operator shift schedule from a given set of work shift types. These heuristics are evaluated both in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, using actual operating data.

## 10. Optimal Price and Protection Period Decisions for a Product Under Warranty
### Author(s):
- Theodore S. Glickman
- Paul D. Berger
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper proposes and analyzes a model for maximizing the profit of a product sold under warranty. The decision variables assumed in the model are the price of the product and the length of the period throughout which the manufacturer is responsible for service. The paper focuses on the dependence of optimal profit on price and protection period for a realistic and general description of a warrantied product. Failures are stochastic and repairs are of constant cost. Demand depends exponentially on price and warranty duration.

## 11. Note—Determination of Warranty Reserves: An Extension
### Author(s):
- H. N. Amato
- E. E. Anderson
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1976
### Abstract:
This paper extends a previously accepted model, used to estimate the warranty reserves required for nonrepayable products, by discounting future warranty costs to their present value, and by adjusting for expected changes in the general price level. The estimation equations are derived and their implications are discussed.
