## 1. Equilibrium Stochastic Choice and Market Penetration Theories: Derivations and Comparisons
### Author(s):
- Frank M. Bass
- Abel Jeuland
- Gordon P. Wright
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
We show in this paper the formal connection between brand switching models and multiperiod analysis of brand choice behavior. A formal, well-defined stochastic process is developed from stochastic choice premises which permits analysis of any event or combination of events in terms of subsets of the market. The formal connection between single-brand analysis and multi-brand analysis is demonstrated. The parameters of the stochastic process involve the market shares and a measure of the heterogeneity of the population. This information is sufficient to permit the estimation of aggregate brand switching on adjacent trials or brand penetration and multiple brand purchasing over sequences of purchase occasions.

## 2. Optimal Portfolios with One Safe and One Risky Asset: Effects of Changes in Rate of Return and Risk
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
- R. Burr Porter
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
This paper examines changes in the optimal proportions of investment capital placed in a safe asset and in a risky asset by an expected utility maximizing risk averse investor. If the return for the safe asset increases and the risky asset distribution remains fixed, the optimal proportion invested in the safe asset will increase provided that the investor's absolute risk aversion is nondecreasing or his proportional risk aversion never exceeds unity. Otherwise, it can be optimal to decrease holdings in the safe asset when its return increases. If the return for the safe asset remains fixed and the risky distribution improves by a first degree stochastic dominance change, the optimal proportion invested in the risky asset will increase (or not decrease) provided that proportional risk aversion never exceeds one plus the product of the gross return for the safe asset times absolute risk aversion. Otherwise, it may be optimal to decrease holdings in the risky asset when its distribution improves in the indicated manner.

## 3. A Data Collection Strategy for Estimation of Cost Coefficients of a Linear Programming Model
### Author(s):
- A. A. Cunningham
- D. M. Frances
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
The problem considered is one of selecting from a number of alternative sources of information for the refinement of estimates of objective function coefficients of a linear programming model. The approach used is that of Bayesian decision theory. A sequential scheme for the computing of bounds on the value of information is devised. Using these bounds the information of greatest value may be identified.

## 4. The Cost Assignment of the Cooperative Water Resource Development: A Game Theoretical Approach
### Author(s):
- Mitsuo Suzuki
- Mikio Nakayama
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
As the demand for natural resources intensifies so too the costs of further exploitation of these resources become enormous. These enormous costs in turn require the development of a given resource to be a cooperative venture among several participants, each of whom must be assured that the costs and benefits of the venture will be “fairly” distributed among them. It is at this point that the theory of cooperative games may offer guidelines as to what is fair or not fair to each participant or player in a given cost allocation. To illustrate an application of cooperative game theory in assigning “fair” costs and benefits to the participants in a cooperative venture we will consider a problem in water resource development.

## 5. Scoring Rules for Continuous Probability Distributions
### Author(s):
- James E. Matheson
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
Personal, or subjective, probabilities are used as inputs to many inferential and decision-making models, and various procedures have been developed for the elicitation of such probabilities. Included among these elicitation procedures are scoring rules, which involve the computation of a score based on the assessor's stated probabilities and on the event that actually occurs. The development of scoring rules has, in general, been restricted to the elicitation of discrete probability distributions. In this paper, families of scoring rules for the elicitation of continuous probability distributions are developed and discussed.

## 6. A Preference Order Dynamic Program for Stochastic Assembly Line Balancing
### Author(s):
- Edward P. C. Kao
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
Consider an assembly line balancing problem with stochastic task times. Our objective is to find a grouping of tasks into stations that satisfies all precedence relations and minimizes the number of stations, subject to the constraint that the probability that the resulting station work content at each station is no more than the given cycle time is bounded by a given value. Similar to Held and Karp's approach, we formulate the problem in dynamic programming. The solution procedure is based on Mitten's preference order dynamic programming

## 7. The Generalized Market Area Problem
### Author(s):
- Timothy J. Lowe
- Arthur P. Hurter, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
This paper considers the production-transportation problem of a firm with a finite number of production (supply) facilities of known location, facing demand distributed over a subset (market region) of K-dimensional Euclidean space. The demand for a single good is described by a demand density function which is continuous almost everywhere on the market region.

## 8. A New Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for the Fixed-Charge Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Jeff Kennington
- Ed Unger
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
A new branch-and-bound procedure specialized for the fixed-charge transportation problem has been developed. The technique strongly exploits the underlying transportation structure. The relaxed problem assumes this form and simple penalties are easily constructed from the optimal solution of this transportation problem. These penalties are used in the standard branch-and-bound tasks of fathoming and guiding separation. The procedure has been coded, and over sixty test problems have been solved.

## 9. The Role of Project Team Collaboration in R&D Performance
### Author(s):
- John D. Aram
- Cyril P. Morgan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
Teamwork or collaboration among professionals, an important element of most R&D laboratories, has received little study in relation to technical performance. This study analyzes the relationship between individual perceptions of team collaboration and individual technical performance in a research and development laboratory. Partial correlations are used to evaluate different models of causality between collaboration, individual needs, opportunities, need satisfaction and technical performance. The study concludes that the relationship between perceived team collaboration and technical performance is not direct. Rather, one particular aspect of collaboration, termed knowledge-based risk taking, creates greater opportunities for scientists and engineers to fulfill a variety of personal needs in the job setting, and these greater opportunities lead to higher technical performance. The study suggests R&D managers can promote greater opportunities for individuals to meet job needs and thus achieve greater technical performance by encouraging a risk taking attitude toward innovation and a collaborative team process within technical work groups.

## 10. A Numerical Algorithm for Recursively-Defined Convolution Integrals Involving Distribution Functions
### Author(s):
- Robert Cleroux
- Denis J. McConalogue
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
Reliability studies give rise to families of distribution functions F(n) defined recursively by the repeated convolution of a distribution function F with itself according to the scheme
where F′ is the derivative of F, and is usually given by a p.d.f. f. In particular, many systems characteristics are defined in terms of integrals of the form ∫0tP(s)(t − x)Q(r)(x) dx where P(s) and Q(r) are the sth and rth members of families generated from distribution functions P and Q, not necessarily distinct.

## 11. An Algorithm for Nonlinear Knapsack Problems
### Author(s):
- Thomas L. Morin
- Roy E. Marsten
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
An algorithm which recursively generates the complete family of undominated feasible solutions to separable nonlinear multidimensional knapsack problems is developed by exploiting discontinuity preserving properties of the maximal convolution. The “curse of dimensionality,” which is usually associated with dynamic programming algorithms, is successfully mitigated by reducing an M-dimensional dynamic program to a 1-dimensional dynamic program through the use of the imbedded state space approach. Computational experience with the algorithm on problems with as many as 10 state variables is also reported and several interesting extensions are discussed.

## 12. Note—The Precarious Boundary Problem
### Author(s):
- T. H. Mattheiss
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
In certain classes of managerial situations violation of “fuzzy” constraints may have very serious consequences. Facing a precarious boundary, a retreat into the interior of the feasible region may seem wise. In this note we suggest a means of accomplishing this using known techniques to (i) identify the center of the feasible region, (ii) find all solutions which are within some proportion of the optimum, (iii) perform a triage on the constraints, and (iv) identify alternate operating plans based on arbitrary constraint weighting schemes.

## 13. Note—On the Optimal Packaging Frequency of Products Jointly Replenished
### Author(s):
- Fred M. Andres
- Hamilton Emmons
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1976
### Abstract:
Goyal [Goyal, S. K. 1974. Determination of the optimum packaging frequency of items jointly replenished. Management Sci.21 (4, December) 436–443.] proposes an algorithm for the purposes of determining the optimal packaging frequency of products that may be jointly replenished. Each time a packaging run is made, costs include a fixed setup cost independent of the number of products packaged, plus an extra setup cost for each product packaged. Holding costs are assumed constant per unit of product per unit time, demand per item is constant, and no back-logging is allowed. While Goyal's algorithm probably gives a good solution, we note some shortcomings.
