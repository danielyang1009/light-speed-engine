### Published:

### Abstract:
In the past few years, increasing numbers of automatic warehousing systems using computer-controlled stacker cranes have been installed. Our research concerns the scientific scheduling and design of these systems. There are three elements to scheduling: the assignment of multiple items to the same pallet (Pallet Assignment); the assignment of pallet loads to storage locations (Storage Assignment); and rules for sequencing storage and retrieve requests (Interleaving). This paper deals with optimal storage assignment. Results are obtained which compare the operating performance of three storage assignment rules: random assignment, which is similar to the closest-open-location rule used by many currently operating systems; full turnover-based assignment: and class-based turnover assignment. It is shown that significant reductions in crane travel time (and distance) are obtainable from turnover-based rules. These improvements can, under certain circumstances, be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems, and may be used to alter the design (e.g., size and number of racks, speed of cranes, etc.) of proposed systems in order to achieve a more desirable system balance between throughput and storage capacity.

## 2. Industrial Market Forecasting with Anticipations Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
A forecasting model for industrial markets is developed and illustrated that utilizes publicly available data on anticipated future capital spending and sales. The model is based upon input demand functions derived from a fixed coefficient production function. Since the proposed forecasting method is easy to implement and offers the prospect of reasonably accurate forecasts, it may serve not only as a principal forecast technique but also as a standard of performance against which more elaborate and costly procedures are judged.

## 3. An Interactive Programming Method for Solving the Multiple Criteria Problem
### Author(s):
- Stanley Zionts
- Jyrki Wallenius
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
In this paper a man-machine interactive mathematical programming method is presented for solving the multiple criteria problem involving a single decision maker. It is assumed that all decision-relevant criteria or objective functions are concave functions to be maximized, and that the constraint set is convex. The overall utility function is assumed to be unknown explicitly to the decision maker, but is assumed to be implicitly a linear function, and more generally a concave function of the objective functions. To solve a problem involving multiple objectives the decision maker is requested to provide answers to yes and no questions regarding certain trade offs that he likes or dislikes. Convergence of the method is proved; a numerical example is presented. Tests of the method as well as an extension of the method for solving integer linear programming problems are also described.

## 4. Production-Inventory Decisions under Order-Occurrence Risk: The Deterministic Order Quantity Case
### Author(s):
- Richard R. Jesse, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
This paper examines the problem of production-inventory decisions under order-occurrence risk. To characterize this problem briefly, let the number of periods which elapse between the receipt of orders n and n + 1 for an item be described by a probability mass function fn(s). If fn(∞) > 0, then order-occurrence risk is said to exist. That is, upon receiving order n for an item, there exists a positive probability that no future orders will occur. Assuming deterministic order quantities, the order-occurrence risk problem is formulated as a dynamic program. Optimal production-inventory disposal policies are characterized for the case of piecewise-linear production-disposal costs and concave increasing holding costs. The production cost is assumed to include a setup cost, and demand backlogging is not permitted. The production and disposal lead times are assumed to be zero.

## 5. Dynamic Correction in Marketing Planning Models
### Author(s):
- Charles B. Weinberg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
Most marketing planning models have carry-over effects in which one period's decisions influence the results obtained in future periods. In this paper it is shown that failure to allow for the carry-over effect beyond the planning horizon can result in underallocation of resources and in biases in the timing pattern of resource expenditure. For a wide class of market planning models, a procedure is developed to take into account this long-term effect. The distortion and the procedure are illustrated in an example.

## 6. Some New Results on Compromise Solutions for Group Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- M. Freimer
- P. L. Yu
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
We report some new results on compromise solutions studied by Yu [Yu, P. L. 1973. A class of decisions for group decision problems. Management Sci.19 (8, April) 936–946]. The following article focuses on the relation between the compromise solution and its parameter. In particular, we show that, under some nice conditions, the compromise solution is a continuous function of its parameter. A fundamental monotonicity result (Theorem 3.1) concerning compromise solutions is derived. The result enables us to generate the bounds of all compromise solutions. When n = 2, two monotonicity results are derived. These yield a good interpretation of the parameter p. When p is small the “group utility” is emphasized; and when p increases the individual regrets receive more weight. Finally we construct an example to illustrate that the monotonicity results for n = 2 are almost impossible to be generated for n > 2.

## 7. Potential Avoidability: A Statistic for Controlling In-Patient Utilization in Acute Care Hospitals
### Author(s):
- R. W. Chorba
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
A patient-day of service is classified as potentially avoidable if the unique facilities and manpower of an acute care hospital are not essential to providing the services received. From a practical standpoint, not all potentially avoidable days are truly avoidable. However, norms can be established, specific to diagnosis, surgery, sex, and age, which specify an acceptable range for the percentage of potentially avoidable days.

## 12. Note—Comments on Goal Programming for Aggregate Planning
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
A recently proposed goal programming approach to aggregate planning of production rates and work force levels is reviewed and it is pointed out that there is very little difference between the “new approach” and the earlier Hansemann and Hess linear programming formulation. It is noted that the HMMS model used as a test vehicle in the original article can also be viewed as a goal programming formulation. Some more general opinions on the role of modelling in decision making are also included.

## 13. Note—A Note on Range Programming: Introducing a “Satisficing Range” in a L.P.
### Author(s):
- Gilles Laurent
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1976
### Abstract:
A new approach to the problem of minimizing a quartic (fourth order) cost function, subject to linear constraints, is presented. A “satisficing range” is introduced for each variable (i.e., a range in which all values of the variable are considered to entail the same minimal cost), leading to a new linear formulation (“range programming”). Improvements in results over previous approaches are reported for a specific example (due to Goodman), and should be expected in general.

### Abstract:
Rami Hofshi and James Korsh [Hofshi, Rami, James Korsh. 1972. A measure of an individual's power in a group. Management Sci.19 (1, September)] (hereafter referred to as H & K) made an important attempt to define a measure of an individual's power in a group. Whereas the direction of their effort is significantly different from earlier efforts in assigning numerical weights to each individual of an organization, there are a number of logical flaws in their model. These comments are meant to identify the inadequacies of the H & K model.
