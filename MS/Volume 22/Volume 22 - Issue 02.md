## 1. Outdoor Recreation Areas: Capacity and the Formulation of Use Policy
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The demand for outdoor recreation areas, such as national parks and forests, is growing. With this growth has come the realization that the administration of parks must maximize visitors' benefits from areas with limited visitor capacity. Visitor traffic has strained both man-made facilities as well as natural or ecological limits. Although individual locations within a park pose capacity restrictions, park capacity for visitors is a function also of visitor movement behavior among the locations. Solution of a linear programming model which represents visitor movement via transition matrices can help identify park capacity for visitors seeking various recreational experiences. The constraints of the model express capacities for both man-made facilities and ecological criteria as a function of visitor requirements. Program objectives derive from park policy about visitor use and benefits. Solutions to the program indicate appropriate long-range visitor admittance policy as well as provide insights for internal park control which is supportive of park objectives.

## 2. On the Optimality of Structured Policies in Countable Stage Decision Processes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
Multi-stage decision processes are considered, in notation which is an outgrowth of that introduced by Denardo [Denardo, E. 1967. Contraction mappings in the theory underlying dynamic programming. SIAM Rev.9 165–177.]. Certain Markov decision processes, stochastic games, and risk-sensitive Markov decision processes can be formulated in this notation. We identify conditions sufficient to prove that, in infinite horizon nonstationary processes, the optimal infinite horizon (present) value exists, is uniquely defined, is what is called “structured,” and can be found by solving Bellman's optimality equations: ϵ-optimal strategies exist: an optimal strategy can be found by applying Bellman's optimality criterion; and a specially identified kind of policy, called a “structured” policy is optimal in each stage. A link is thus drawn between (i) studies such as those of Blackwell [Blackwell, D. 1965. Discounted dynamic programming. Ann. Math. Stat.36 226–235.] and Strauch [Strauch, R. 1966. Negative dynamic programming. Ann. Math. Stat.37 871–890.], where general policies for general processes are considered, and (ii) other studies, such as those of Scarf [Scarf, H. 1963. The optimality of (S, s) policies in the dynamic inventory problem. H. Scarf, D. Gilford, M. Shelly, eds. Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences . Stanford University Press, Stanford.] and Derman [Derman, C. 1963. On optimal replacement rules when changes of state are Markovian. R. Bellman, ed. Mathematical Optimization Techniques. University of California Press. Berkeley.] where structured policies for special processes are considered. Those familiar with dynamic programming models (e.g., inventory, queueing optimization, replacement, optimal stopping) will be well acquainted with the use of what we call structured policies and value functions. The infinite stage results are built on finite stage results. Results for the stationary infinite horizon case are also included. For an application, we provide conditions sufficient to prove that an optimal stationary strategy exists in a discounted stationary risk sensitive Markov decision process with constant risk aversion. In Porteus [Porteus, E. On the optimality of structured policies in countable stage decision processes. Research Paper No. 141, Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, 71 pp., 1973, 1974, unabridged version of present paper.], of which this is a condensation, we also (i) show how known conditions under which a Borel measurable policy is optimal in an infinite horizon, nonstationary Markov decision process, fit into our framework, and (ii) provide conditions under which a generalized (s, S) policy [Porteus, E. 1971. On the optimality of generalized (s, S) policies. Management Sci.17 411–426.] is optimal in an infinite horizon nonstationary inventory process.

## 3. A Dynamic Programming Solution to Cost-Time Tradeoff for CPM
### Author(s):
- Don R. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
To solve the problem of time-cost tradeoff in project management with available models, a choice must be made between heuristic approaches and algorithms based upon restrictive assumptions about the shape of the cost-time functions of the activities. The algorithm presented in this article involves a dynamic-programming approach to determine the allocation which minimizes the duration of the project (critical path). The main advantage of this model is its ability to determine the optimum allocation among activities with arbitrary cost-time functions. Also, computational shortcuts for functions with special properties can be used to increase the efficiency of the model.

## 4. Queueing Models of Community Correctional Centers in the District of Columbia
### Author(s):
- Carl M. Harris
- T. R. Thiagarajan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of GI/M/c and heavy-traffic GI/G/c queues for modeling the utilization of community correctional centers or halfway houses in the District of Columbia. These models arise by considering each bed of a total of c in a facility as, a service channel providing random amounts of service to a constant stream of arrivals. The results have been used to provide decision-makers with means to evaluate facility use. The ultimate strategies are to be based on a subjectively chosen “optimal” balance between customer waiting time to get into the center and relative traffic intensity.

## 6. Group Decisions in the Face of Differences of Opinion
### Author(s):
- Michael Bacharach
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
Suppose a number of honest, intelligent individuals differ in their rankings of a set of possible actions. They may do so because they have difierent objectives, or they may do so solely because they disagree about what are the probable outcomes of the acts. The latter is the relevant case if they are acting disinterestedly as consultants. In this case how should the actions be ranked by the executive? Here the essential problem is that of “consensus theory”—to find a reasonable way of resolving the experts' differences of opinion about the facts (the circumstances determining the outcomes).

## 7. Critical Ratio Scheduling: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):
- William L. Berry
- Vittal Rao
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
Critical Ratio scheduling has been implemented in job shops that manufacture component parts for stock replenishment as well as direct customer orders. Proponents of this technique argue that scheduling performance is improved by gathering and processing two different types of operating information on a routine basis for use in making priority scheduling decisions: queue waiting time information for individual machines and stock status information from the shop's inventory system. Simulation experiments are reported here which describe the effect on the performance of a shop and its associated inventor' system when using this type of information with an Order Point inventory control system. The results indicate that the additional information provided by the increased data collection and processing functions does not contribute a statistically significant improvement in the overall performance of the production system.

## 8. Utilization of Idle Time in an M/G/1 Queueing System
### Author(s):
- Yonatan Levy
- Uri Yechiali
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
This paper studies an M/G/1 queue where the idle time of the server is utilized for additional work in a secondary system. As usual, the server is busy as long as there are units in the main system. However, as soon as the server becomes idle he leaves for a “vacation.” The duration of a vacation is a random variable with a known distribution function. Two models are considered. In the first, upon termination of a vacation the server returns to the main queue and begins to serve those units, if any, that have arrived during the vacation. If no units have arrived the server waits for the first arrival when an ordinary M/G/1 busy period is initiated. In the second model if the server finds the system empty at the end of a vacation, he immediately takes another vacation, etc. For both models Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of the occupation period, vacation period and waiting time are derived and generating functions of the number of units in the system are calculated. The two models are then compared to each other, and for some special cases the optimal mean vacation times are found.

## 9. An Integrated Model for Accounts Receivable Management
### Author(s):
- Zvi Lieber
- Yair E. Orgler
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to present an integrated model of accounts receivable. The model incorporates the major components of credit and collection policies such as the cash discount, credit period and charges for late payments. It considers the investment in accounts receivable, losses from bad debts and the impact of credit terms on sales. The objective is to maximize the present value of net earnings from accounts receivable. After deriving the general model, a simplified version is solved by classical optimization techniques under various sets of assumptions that are gradually relaxed.

### Author(s):
- Bruce L. Miller
### Published:

### Abstract:
We consider a portfolio model with an infinite planning horizon. It is shown that the investment policy of maximizing the expected log each period is optimal when the utility function depends only on the tail of the sequence representing the capital at each period.

## 11. Policy Making Under Discontinuous Change: The Situational Normativism Approach
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1975
### Abstract:
Policy making under conditions of discontinuous change is discussed in terms of situational normativism, a descriptive-normative approach to policy making systems. Under such conditions, norms and values play a key role in the adaptation of the system. The nature of norms and values within situational normativism is discussed, and implications for system adaptation are explored. Aspects of policy, strategy, planning and system design are considered. A behavioral model for purposeful search and adaptation under discontinuity is presented. At the policy level a referral process is described which allows for change with respect to the set of operational goal variables. This involves referral between operational goals and nonoperational goals (values) and norms. The use of the model in the situational normativism approach to planning under discontinuity is discussed.
