## 1. Compound-Return Mean-Variance Efficient Portfolios Never Risk Ruin
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
The implications of concentrating on the lowest moment(s) of average compound return over N periods in making investment decisions have recently been examined. In particular, maximization of expected average compound return has been shown to imply the existence of a utility of wealth function in each period with the “right” properties for all finite N ≥ 2 as well as in the limit. More importantly, for large N a close (or exact) approximation to the set of mean-variance efficient portfolios (with respect to average compound return) is obtainable via a subset of the isoelastic class of utility of wealth functions. The properties of this class render it both empirically plausible and highly attractive analytically: among them are monotonicity, strict concavity, and decreasing risk aversion; moreover, the optimal mix of risky assets is independent of initial wealth (providing a basis for the formation of mutual funds) and the optimal investment policy is myopic. The purpose of this paper is to extend the class of return distributions for which the preceding results hold and to demonstrate that portfolios which are efficient with respect to average compound return, at least for large N, do not risk ruin either in a short-run or a long-run sense.

## 3. A Computer Simulation Model for the Control of Rabies in an Urban Area of Colombia
### Author(s):
- Ralph R. Frerichs
- Juan Prawda
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
A simulation model is developed describing the transmission of canine rabies within and between 116 spatially distributed barrios (neighborhoods) in Cali, Colombia. The discrete time, dynamic model considers both discrete random variables (incubation and infective periods, appearance and movement of rabid dogs through the city, etc.) and deterministic variables (demographic components of barrio canine populations). Values for the input variables were acquired through field observations, other Colombian sources, and a review of the literature. Various canine vaccination strategies were tested in the model over a ten-year planning horizon for their cost-effectiveness with regard to the prevention of canine rabies. The model is recommended to the Pan American Health Organization to be used as an interactive gaming model to aid health system managers in Cali, Colombia and in other Latin American cities in scheduling the time and locations of vaccination teams in a more cost-effective manner.

## 4. Regression Analysis for Multiplicative Phenomena and its Implication for the Measurement of Investment Risk
### Author(s):
- Meir I. Schneller
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
Beta—the systematic risk—is generally accepted as a measure for the risk involved in holding a portfolio of risky securities. It will be shown in this paper that, because beta is measured by regressing one multiplicative variable (the rate of return of a security or a portfolio) on another multiplicative variable (the market), in the long run, the systematic risk will approach either zero or infinity. It will also be shown that in the long run the unsystematic risk will dominate the systematic risk, and that, regardless of the value of this latter risk. This implies that for investors with long planning horizon the information conveyed in the systematic risk of an investment is rather limited.

## 6. Group Decision Making Using Cardinal Social Welfare Functions
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Keeney
- Craig W. Kirkwood
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of constructing a group cardinal social welfare function whose arguments are the individual utility functions of group members. Representation theorems are given which show that the social welfare function is restricted to special forms if certain “reasonable” conditions hold. The appropriateness of these conditions for different types of group decision problems is discussed.

## 7. Explicit Solutions in Convex Goal Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- D. Klingman
- R. J. Niehaus
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
Goal programming has now become an important tool in areas such as public management science. There is therefore a need for examining ways of securing improved computational efficiency, as is done in this paper, instead of resting only on the linear programming equivalences that were set forth when the original goal programming article was published in Vol. 1, No. 2 of Management Science. Based on lemmata which permit reduction of various important classes of convex goal programming models to problems of full row rank-interval programming type, explicit solutions to convex goal programming problems are exhibited. Some of the equivalences herein established are also useful in their own right and for other classes of problems—e.g., interval programming—as well as advanced start procedures and other such computational matters.

### Abstract:
An experiment is defined as a random variable which may take some posterior probability distributions according to a marginal probability. Elementary properties of this definition with respect to information value theory are derived as well as their practical implications.

## 9. Improved Linear Integer Programming Formulations of Nonlinear Integer Problems
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
A variety of combinatorial problems (e.g., in capital budgeting, scheduling, allocation) can be expressed as a linear integer programming problem. However, the standard devices for doing this often produce an inordinate number of variables and constraints, putting the problem beyond the practical reach of available integer programming methods.

## 10. Optimal Operation of Public Lotteries
### Author(s):
- Arnon Perry
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
Public lotteries form an important source of revenue for many national and state governments, but little quantitative effort has been applied to their efficient operation. We here formulate a model in which the net revenue per unit time from the operation of a lottery depends upon the prizes offered, the price charged per ticket, and the time interval between successive drawings. The model is solved for the optimal values of these decision variables, and some illustrative numerical results are presented.

## 11. Duels with Continuous Firing
### Author(s):
- John Patrick Lang
- George Kimeldorf
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
A game-theoretic model is proposed for the generalization of a discrete-fire silent duel to a silent duel with continuous firing. This zero-sum two-person game is solved in the symmetric case. It is shown that pure optimal strategies exist and hence also solve a noisy duel with continuous firing. A solution for the general nonsymmetric duel is conjectured.

## 12. Stochastic Dominance Tests for Selecting Acceptable Debt Issuance Strategies
### Author(s):
- Leroy D. Brooks
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
The use of the Stochastic Dominance (SD) ordering rules in selecting a set of acceptable debt issuance strategies is examined. A procedure for selecting among alternative strategies on both the timing of issuance and maturity composition of a portfolio of liabilities is formulated. An application of the SD rules provides an effective analytical alternative to subjective judgment in determining debt timing policy when there are uncertain future costs. The SD approach enables a choice of strategies where there are specific stated assumptions on the nature of the underlying utility functions; the decisions are not based on subjective estimates of utility. An application of the ordering rules to the debt timing decision requires the use of a solution procedure applicable to a multi-period case having nonstationary probability functions over time. An application of the model to a small sample problem indicates the information requirements, SD test results, and the evaluation of the tests.

## 13. Nash Equilibria in a Sealed Bid Auction
### Author(s):
- Benjamin T. Smith
- James H. Case
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
The sealed bid auction with two bidders is regarded as a two-person variable sum game. Under perfect information a class of one-parameter distributions emerges as being “best” strategies for either bidder. Under imperfect information, approximations to these strategies lead to Nash equilibrium strategies for both players which are relatively insensitive to unilateral deviation by either of the bidders.

## 14. Note—A Comment on Blau's Dilemma in “Stochastic Programming” and Bayesian Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
Using what he calls a “Basic Chance Constrained Programming Model,” BCCM, R. A. Blau proceeds in Blau [Blau, R. A. 1974. Stochastic programming and decision analysis: an apparent dilemma. Management Sci.21 (3, November) 271–276.] to derive some results which he believes lead to a dilemma in which EPVI, the Expected Value of Perfect Information, is less than EVSI, the Expected Value of Sample Information. This is one part of Blau's dilemma. In addition, EPVI and EVSI are both negative. This is the other part of Blau's dilemma, from which he goes on to a variety of philosophic and other objections that he believes relate to contrasts between Bayesian decision theory and other, more classic, approaches in statistics. The latter are, in turn, related to chance constrained programming, and so on, but in ways that are only adumbrated rather than developed in detail by Blau.

## 15. Note—A Note on First-Degree Stochastic Dominance and Portfolio Composition
### Author(s):
- William F. Rentz
- Richard B. Westin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1975
### Abstract:
Suppose an investor is faced with two assets with stochastic rates of return such that in an either-or choice situation the investor can express a preference over the marginal probability distributions of the rates of returns of the assets. If the investor is able to form a portfolio containing both assets, does the fact that he can express a preference over the marginal distributions of the rates of return of the assets allow us to state qualitative restrictions on the composition of his optimal portfolio?
