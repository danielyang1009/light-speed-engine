## 1. A Survey of Users of Corporate Planning Models
### Author(s):
- Thomas H. Naylor
- Horst Schauland
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
Why are over 2,000 corporations either using, developing, or planning to develop some form of corporate simulation model? What types of companies are using corporate planning models? How are they being used? Which resources are required? These are among the questions which were raised in a recent survey of 346 companies whose results are summarized in this paper. The paper also examines the costs and benefits to be derived from using corporate simulation models. Finally, drawing on the survey results, the authors speculate on future developments in the field of corporate modeling.

## 2. Bayesian Point Estimation and the PERT Scheduling of Stochastic Activities
### Author(s):
- Robert R. Britney
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
Conventional PERT procedures frequently introduce undesirable and often indeterminant biases into the derived time statistics of large-scale complex projects. An alternative scheduling procedure BPERT is developed, employing an activity-based time estimation loss structure and a cost-minimization criterion. Bayesian point estimates are formulated for beta-distributed activity duration times minimizing the potential losses of misestimation. Viewed as certainty equivalents, these time estimates are then aggregated to yield a single project completion time. “Crashing” is introduced, and us implications for BPERT examined. An illustrative example contrasts PERT and BPERT.

## 3. Planning for Freedom
### Author(s):
- John P. Van Gigch
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
Freedom can be planned. It is the result of a designing triad consisting of the planning agents' assumptions, the planning system's conditions and the opportunities and/or barriers which enhance or hinder the exercise of freedom. The “assumptions-conditions-opportunities” triad is examined to show that different combinations of the designing components result in different types of freedom. Four planning models, all claiming to be “democratic,” are examined. It is shown that each system offers its own “brand” of freedom or freedoms. Therefore, comparisons of the amounts or kinds of freedom(s) among systems remain unresolved. Each system can justify the freedom afforded in terms of the consonance existing between the agents' assumptions and the values and beliefs of those it serves.

## 4. A Collections Planning Model for Regional Blood Suppliers: Description and Validation
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
A planning model has been developed to assist regional blood suppliers in alleviating seasonal imbalances between supply and demand of blood. A Markovian population model is used to project various performance measures for a blood supply region. These measures are summarized in graphs covering a planning period of several months to one year. The planner improves projected performance by changing collection plans and using the planning model iteratively to evaluate each plan. The data required by the model are generally available: past performance of bloodmobile sponsors, quotas and demand forecasts. In this paper the model is described, projected performance measures are validated against actual measures, sensitivity to errors in inputs is analyzed and the model is evaluated relative to less complex models. The planning model is shown to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose and highly effective for its cost. It has been implemented by two regional blood suppliers using remote computer terminals.

## 5. A Branch and Bound Algorithm for Optimum Allocation of Float Nurses
### Author(s):
- Vandankumar M. Trivedi
- D. Michael Warner
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
This paper discusses a methodology developed for allocation of float nurses in short-term general hospitals. The severity of need for nursing care on a unit is measured from the perceptions of head nurses of the unit. A multivariate regression model is used to predict head nurses perceptions at the beginning of a shift from certain auditable variables. The multivariate regressions are used as an objective function in a branch and bound allocation model designed to allocate float nurses before the start of a shift. The model is tested in five nursing units of a study hospital, and results are presented.

## 6. The GPSS Simulation of Scheduling Policies for Surgical Patients
### Author(s):
- N. K. Kwak
- P. J. Kuzdrall
- Homer H. Schmitz
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to determine and evaluate utilization levels of the operating-room and recovery-room facilities of a hospital under different policy considerations governing patient flows. The utilization rates are examined under constraints that apply to the particular hospital from which the empirical data was obtained; however, the model and approach were designed with general applications in mind. The range of values for critical timing measurements is obtained from a model employing the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The model is programmed in GPSS and was run on an IBM 360/165. An optimal policy that satisfies the “real world” constraints of an active hospital is sought. The output from the model is interpreted. It is revealed that increases in facility utilization can be made while meeting the constraints dictated by normal hospital routine, thus offering the possibility of reducing costs.

## 7. Health Status Index Models: A Unified Mathematical View
### Author(s):
- George W. Torrance
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
A general mathematical formulation of the health status index model is developed. Equations are given for three types of population health indexes and for the determination of the amount of health improvement created by a health care program. Fourteen of the major health status index models from the literature are analyzed, and it is shown that each can be viewed as a special case of the general formulation. It is hoped that the paper will help to unify the health status index concept, will serve to standardize terminology and notation, and will facilitate comparisons of the various models.

## 8. Myopic Approximations for the Perishable Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Steven Nahmias
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
Recent work in describing optimal ordering policies for perishable inventory casts the problem as a multi-dimensional dynamic program, the dimensionality being one less than the useful lifetime of the product, m. As m becomes large the computational problem becomes severe so that developing approximations is a key problem. A bound on the perishing cost is obtained that is a function only of the total inventory on hand. Substituting this bound and an approximate transfer function, optimal policies can be computed myopically for the new problem. When the demand density possesses a monotone likelihood ratio, it is shown the function to be minimized is strictly pseudo-convex. Sample computations for special cases indicate that the approximation results in costs which are generally less than one percent higher than the optimal.

## 9. A Health Index for Patient Selection: A Value Function Approach with Application to Chronic Renal Failure Patients
### Author(s):
- Joseph S. Pliskin
- Clyde H. Beck, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
Concrete criteria are needed for patient selection for scarce medical treatments and ranking of patient urgency for, or salvageability by, a given form of treatment. The mathematical theory of multi-attribute value functions is employed to rank order chronic renal failure patients with regard to therapeutic expectations. Order-2 mutual preferential independence was observed, thus an additive value function was justified. The paper demonstrates two different procedures for assessing a value function over a discrete attribute. The proposed approach yields a rank ordering (health status index) consistent with the physician's preferences and judgment. It can be employed for any medical decision process, even when only weaker preferential independence properties apply.

## 10. Stochastic Programming of Multiple Channel Service Systems with Deterministic Inflow and Stochastic Service Times
### Author(s):
- Michael Resh
- Moshe Friedman
### Published:
- 1 May 1976
### Abstract:
The problem of allocating customers of different types to various channels of a service system is considered. Service times are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables whose distribution functions depend on the type of customers as well as the service channel. The total loading time of each channel consists of the sum of service times of all customers which were allocated to it and is thus a random variable also. If the loading time of a given channel exceeds (falls short) its nominal capacity, an overtime (idle time) penalty is incurred. Penalties are assumed to be proportional to the time lapse involved. There is also a revenue gain which is proportional to the number of customers served. The objective is to find the optimal allocation of customers to channels, xij, such that the expected net gain, revenue minus losses, is maximized.
