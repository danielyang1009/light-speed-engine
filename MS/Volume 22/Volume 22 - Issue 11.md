## 1. Optimal TIC Bids on Serial Bond Issues
### Author(s):
- G. O. Bierwag
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
Most serial bond issues are sold competitively on an NIC (net interest cost) basis. The municipality awards the issue to the bidder submitting the lowest NIC. Although it is often acknowledged that NIC is a defective measure of the interest cost and sometimes a costly one to the issuer, an alternative measure, the TIC (true interest cost, effective interest cost, interest cost according to the Canadian method, or the internal rate of return) is often regarded as too computationally difficult to employ. State and local governments are becoming increasingly aware of the internal rate of return or TIC as a measure of interest expense. The use of TIC as a method of awarding bond issues to underwriters is growing very rapidly. This paper contains a simple computer algorithm for calculating optimal bids on a TIC basis.

## 2. Heuristics for Scheduling Resource-Constrained Projects: An Experimental Investigation
### Author(s):
- Dale F. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
This paper considers the project scheduling problem with multiple constrained resources. Two classes of heuristic procedure, both making use of priority rules, are discussed: the parallel method, which generates just one schedule; and the sampling method, which generates a set of schedules using probabilistic techniques and selects the best schedule from this sample. An experimental investigation is described in which a set of projects with different characteristics is scheduled by each of these heuristics with a variety of priority rules. The effects of the heuristic method, the project characteristics and the priority rules are assessed. It is shown that the choice of priority rule is important with the parallel method, but with the sampling method, although it does affect the distribution of the sample, the choice of rule is not significant. The sampling method with sample size 100 is shown to produce samples at least 7% better than those generated by the corresponding parallel method, with 99% confidence. Further results are discussed and conclusions are presented.

## 3. Generalized Linear Programming Solves the Dual
### Author(s):
- T. L. Magnanti
- J. F. Shapiro
- M. H. Wagner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
The generalized linear programming algorithm allows an arbitrary mathematical programming minimization problem to be analyzed as a sequence of linear programming approximations. Under fairly general assumptions, it is demonstrated that any limit point of the sequence of optimal linear programming dual prices produced by the algorithm is optimal in a concave maximization problem that is dual to the arbitrary primal problem. This result holds even if the generalized linear programming problem does not solve the primal problem. The result is a consequence of the equivalence that exists between the operations of convexification and dualization of a primal problem. The exact mathematical nature of this equivalence is given.

## 4. The Disaggregation of Aggregate Manpower Plans
### Author(s):
- Larry P. Ritzman
- LeRoy J. Krajewski
- Michael J. Showalter
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
Aggregate manpower plans can be made operational only if they are translatable into shorter range assignments of personnel to specific work groups, operations, and products or services. This paper describes a combined heuristic programming and simulation algorithm amenable to this process of decomposition. Due to the complexity of the problem and the multiplicity of objectives, optimization techniques are only of academic interest. The algorithm is adapted to a particular environment, namely the construction of tour assignments in a post office. A “tour assignment” specifies simultaneously the exact timing (days and hours) of the work week (shift or tour) as well as the particular job assignment for each employee in the workforce. After describing the problem structure, the algorithm's logic is explained along with the interactive nature of the man-machine approach. Several options can be exercised to combine the power of a computer model with the judgment of the decision maker. The application of this methodology is illustrated with representative data, showing how the search and decision process can be conducted.

## 5. Consistent Recruitment in a Graded Manpower System
### Author(s):
- G. S. Davies
### Published:

## 6. A Network Flow Model for Allocation of Land Uses to Sectors
### Author(s):
- Gordon Bagby
- Arne Thesen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
An efficient approach to the problem of minimizing total construction and utility distribution network costs in a region while still meeting projected land use demands is presented. The region is modelled as a directed network with land represented by nodes and utility links by branches. When bounds and costs are placed on levels of land uses and on utility flows in links, the problem becomes a linear programming problem with a special structure. An application of this approach for three utilities and eighty zones is presented together with a discussion on the validity of many assumptions.

## 7. An Extension of the Bierman-Hausman Model for Credit Granting
### Author(s):
- Yvo M. I. Dirickx
- Lee Wakeman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
This paper extends the Bierman-Hausman credit-granting model by proving that although the distribution on the probability of collection in the case of failure is no longer a conjugate Beta, it remains tractable; the model therefore need no longer be terminated in the case of failure. Further theorems on the structure of optimal policies, which result in a considerable reduction of the dynamic programming state space, are then presented, and the paper concludes with a discussion of extensions and applications.

## 8. A Bayesian Algorithm for Determining Optimal Single Sample Acceptance Plans for Product Attributes
### Author(s):
- Herbert Moskowitz
- William L. Berry
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
The Bayesian algorithm presented in this paper provides a generalized procedure for determining the minimum cost sample size (n*) and acceptance number (c*) for single sample attribute acceptance plans. The algorithm is applicable to a broad range of acceptance sampling problems, assuming only that the distributions of product quality are discrete, and that the sampling cost is either a linear or strictly convex function of the sample size. Experimental results are presented that compare the solution quality and the computational requirements of this algorithm with three types of previously reported procedures: (1) Bayesian decision tree methods, (2) analytic approximation methods, and (3) direct search techniques. The results indicate that the algorithm produces the optimal solution with minimal computational requirements over a wide range of acceptance sampling problem types.

## 9. Bias and Error Detection in Property Tax Administration
### Author(s):
- Pao Lun Cheng
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
Reform of property tax administration to insure uniform assessment has received increasing attention. Tax administrators at local levels have responded accordingly. A practical scheme for monitoring appraisal biases and errors that cause departure from assessment uniformity has however, been lacking. This paper proposes a stochastic model of biases and errors in assessment administration and transforms it into a regression scheme for estimating bias and errors arising from growth, market and appraising processes. The model is then approximately validated for use in detecting biases and errors by any municipality interested in maintaining assessment uniformity.

## 10. Multi-Period Consumption Decision under Conditions of Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Haim Levy
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
An investor is faced with several investment alternatives. Any investment plan induces a vector of consumption where the consumption in each period is a random variable. Obviously, the optimal vector of consumption is determined by the multi-period utility function. However, in most cases we have no information on the investor's preference, and hence we cannot choose the optimal consumption strategy.

## 11. Maximal Closure of a Graph and Applications to Combinatorial Problems
### Author(s):
- Jean-Claude Picard
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
This paper generalizes the selection problem discussed by J. M. Rhys [Rhys, J. M. W. 1970. Shared fixed cost and network flows. Management Sci.17 (3, November).], J. D. Murchland [Murchland, J. D. 1968. Rhys's combinatorial station selection problem. London Graduate School of Business Studies, Transport Network Theory Unit, Report LBS-TNT-68, June 10.], M. L. Balinski [Balinski, M. L. 1970. On a selection problem. Management Sci.17 (3, November).] and P. Hansen [Hansen, P. 1974. Quelques approches de la programmation non lineaire en variables 0-1. Conference on Mathematical Programming, Bruxelles, May.]. Given a directed graph G, a closure of G is defined as a subset of nodes such that if a node belongs to the closure all its successors also belong to the set. If a real number is associated to each node of G a maximal closure is defined as a closure of maximal value.

## 12. The Time Domain Implications of Phase Angles and Tau
### Author(s):
- Jimmy E. Hilliard
- Hiram C. Barksdale
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
In cross-spectral analysis, the tau statistic is used to infer lead-lag relationships between series in the time domain. Unfortunately, it is frequently inferred that tau is meaningful only when the phase diagram is linear. In this paper it is shown that tau is far more robust than is generally recognized. By appeal to the Cramer Decomposition Theorem, the time-domain interpretation of tau is developed and shown to possess optimum mean square properties. While some of the theoretical background is expository, its inclusion facilitates an intuitive analysis of a number of models. We focus in particular on a model that generates a phase reversal similar to that often found in the spectral analysis of aggregate economic series.

## 13. Communication to the Editor—The Cluster Plan for Desegregating Public Schools, or a Little Less Weltanschauung, Please, for Some More Adequate Descriptions
### Author(s):
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1976
### Abstract:
It may not be possible to be wholly objective, as Messrs. Stimson and Thompson (among others) assert (see [Stimson, D. H., R. P. Thompson. 1975. The importance of ‘Weltanschauung’ in Operations Research: The case of the school busing problem. Management Sci.21 (10, June) 1123–1132.]). Nevertheless, one should be as objective as possible in OR, or any other science, and this carries with it the concomitant duty of accurate and adequate descriptions—including descriptions of work by others to the extent that it may be pertinent.
