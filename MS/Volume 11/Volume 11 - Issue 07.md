## 1. PARM—An Economic Programming Model
### Author(s):
- Marshall K. Wood
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
PARM is an acronym for Program Analysis for Resource Management. It is a general-purpose system for preparing feasible schedules for large, complex systems of interdependent activities to support specified objectives subject to resource constraints. The procedure provides for an iterative process alternating between human decision-making and machine computation in which the goal is achievement of a feasible and acceptable program. Feasibility is objectively determined, but acceptability is subjectively determined. No overall optimizing criterion is assumed to be definable; but many optimizing procedures of limited scope are included.

## 2. Bimatrix Equilibrium Points and Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- C. E. Lemke
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
Some simple constructive proofs are given of solutions to the matric system Mz − ω = q; z ≧ 0; ω ≧ 0; and zT ω = 0, for various kinds of data M, q, which embrace the quadratic programming problem and the problem of finding equilibrium points of bimatrix games. The general scheme is, assuming non-degeneracy, to generate an adjacent extreme point path leading to a solution. The scheme does not require that some functional be reduced.

## 3. An Empirical Study of Exactly and Approximately Optimal Inventory Policies
### Author(s):

- Michael O'Hagan
- Bertil Lundh
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
The (s, S) inventory model (infinite horizon with stationary parameters) is explored with a view toward determining the dependency of the optimal policy on the model's parameters and toward evaluating the effectiveness of several numerical approximation methods for obtaining nearly optimal policies. The mode of attack is empirical: We compare the results for 828 cases, which encompass several values for each of the economic parameters, three delivery lags, and three distinct demand probability distributions with varying parameter values. We demonstrate for these cases that close to optimal results can be obtained by applying the Fibonacci search procedure, by using a particular asymptotic approximation, as well as by substituting a certain policy not of the (s, S) form.

## 4. A Note on the Assortment Problem
### Author(s):
- Charles R. Frank, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
Wieslaw Sadowski [Sadowski, W. 1959. A few remarks on the assortment problem. Management Sci.6 (1, October).] has proposed a dynamic programming approach to the solution of the assortment problem by showing its equivalence to the shortest route problem and using Bellman's algorithm [Bellman, R. 1957. Dynamic Programming. Princeton, University Press, New Jersey.]. In this paper we offer an alternative solution which solves a slightly more general problem and prove a theorem which greatly reduces the amount of computation necessary to arrive at a solution.

## 5. Assembly Line Balancing Using Probabilistic Combinations of Heuristics
### Author(s):
- Fred M. Tonge
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
Several recent research efforts have studied the use of probabilistic schemes for generating solutions to particular combinatorial problems. Characteristically, such schemes include both rapid production of many potential solutions, through repeated application of simple choice rules, and dynamic modification of the production process (“learning”).

## 6. A Dynamic Model of the Firm
### Author(s):
- Kong Chu
- Thomas H. Naylor
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
In this paper we utilize traditional microeconomic theory and elementary queuing theory to develop a computer simulation model of a single-product, multi-process firm. One of our objectives is to demonstrate that the body of economic theory known as the “theory of the firm” may be used to provide a convenient frame of reference in applying some of the more recently developed analytical tools of operations research and computer technology to the analysis of the behavior of the firm. The static equilibrium model of the firm presented in Value and Capital by J. R. Hicks is taken as a point of departure in constructing a simulation model in which (1) the time interval between the arrival of orders at the firm is a stochastic variate with a known probability distribution, (2) each order which the firm receives must pass through n processes before it is transformed into a single unit of output, and (3) the time interval which an order spends at the jth process (j = 1,…, n) is a stochastic variate with a known probability distribution.

## 7. Communications to the Editor—The Problem of Dependability of a Complex System Having Two Types of Components
### Author(s):
- R. K. Wasan
### Published:
- 1 May 1965
### Abstract:
In this communication, the MATHEMATICAL investigations have been carried out to study the behaviour of a complex system having two types of components with regard to dependability. The principal results of this paper are the Laplace transforms of the probabilities that the system ia operating under “normal efficiency,” “reduced efficiency” and is in the “failed and under repair” state. Results in particular cases have been deduced. The inclusion of supplementary variable technique [2 and 6] has been employed to obtain the solution.
