## 1. The Unity of Science and Management
### Author(s):
- David B. Hertz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1965
### Abstract:
It has been the custom of the President of The Institute of Management Sciences, at the ending of his term of office, to explore various aspects of the affairs of the Institute and to indicate trends and directions for the future. I shall not directly touch on the varied, vigorous, and extensive activities of TIMS members, chapters, colleges, editors, meeting committees, and officers, but I do wish to express my gratitude and that of the council for all who have participated in carrying out our goals of identification, unification, and extension of scientific knowledge that contributes to the understanding and improvement of management practice.

## 2. The Production Process: Operating Characteristics
### Author(s):
- Adam Abruzzi
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1965
### Abstract:
It is the thesis of this paper that the production process has an operating logic whose kernel is found in an organizational plan and program. In this sense there exist only two types of organization, classically identified as the straight-line type and the job-shop type. Considered in usual analytical terms, no industrial plant is completely of one type or of the other. However, the two types are sharply distinguishable—Indeed they are opposites—in terms, particularly, of their programs, which refer to organic, rather than analytical, parameters.

## 3. A General Purpose Forecast Simulator
### Author(s):
- Donald Gross
- Jack L. Ray
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1965
### Abstract:
A simulator is developed which enables a variety of forecasting procedures to be tested on any given time series. The simulator determines the standard deviation of the forecast error for each of the procedures tried, indicates the procedure which is optimal in the sense of lowest standard deviation of forecast error, and presents projections and graphs of actual versus predicted values. The time series under study can be either a real time series read into the simulator or a time series generated by the simulator.

## 4. Adaptation in the Production Process
### Author(s):
- Ferdinand K. Levy
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1965
### Abstract:
The paper presents a new type of learning function useful in describing how firms improve their performances in new processes. The function, termed the “adaptation function,” is shown to be capable of being related to variables that may affect a firm's rate of learning. Next, these variables are discussed, and the adaptation function is fitted to some actual sets of data. Finally, the paper turns to some normative implications of the function. Specifically, the adaptation function is shown to be useful to firms in their budgeting of training and in aiding their equipment replacement decisions.
