## 1. A Quantitative Approach to Employment Planning
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1965
### Abstract:
A model is developed for planning the intake of employees as a function of time in the face of varying demand for service. The problem is complicated by resignations which, in part, depend on the intake. The model is solved by dynamic programming using a form of successive approximations to circumvent the computational difficulty of high state variable dimensionality. The model is presented in the context of a real situation for which the results have been successfully implemented.

## 2. Three Heuristic Rules for Sequencing Jobs to a Single Production Facility
### Author(s):
- J. William Gavett
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1965
### Abstract:
This paper presents the experimental performance of three elementary rules for sequencing jobs through a single production facility. The problem is a variant of the “traveling salesman problem.” It is presented in terms of the job sequencing problem because of practical constraints on problem solving methods encountered in this situation. The objective of the sequencing decision is to minimize the facility downtime or setup time over a finite batch of jobs. The study consists of examining the performance of the three heuristic rules in terms of two criteria. The first is the optimal downtime obtained by the branch and bound algorithm. The second is the downtime which results from a random sequencing of jobs through the facility. The sampling procedure considers different values of the variance of between-job setup times, the number of jobs in the sequencing batch, and the form of the distribution of setup times.

## 3. Statistical Control Applications in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Norbert Lloyd Enrick
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1965
### Abstract:
Solution of the product mix problem of Linear Programming leads to recommended quantities of various product styles that must be sold if the firm's ideal profit potential, based on productive capacity and market requirements, is to be realized.

## 4. Contract Research Proposal Preparation Strategies
### Author(s):
- Burton V. Dean
- Robert H. Culhan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1965
### Abstract:
A bidding model is developed and used to examine alternative contract research proposal preparation strategies. Expected profits due to sales from initial and follow-on production orders are related to proposal preparation cost, contract value, and the probability of contract award. Limited engineering resources may be allocated to proposal preparation effort so as to maximize total expected profits. The model is tested and applied in the proposal preparation activity of a company in the aerospace industry.

## 5. Econometrics and Management Science: Their Overlap and Interaction
### Author(s):
- H. Thiel
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1965
### Abstract:
This is an expository article on the relationship of econometrics and management science. After some general observations it considers a number of applications, such as prediction on the basis of input-output models and of econometric macromodels and decision-making based on linear decision rules. These rules are applied to cost minimization in a factory and welfare maximization for a country as a whole. In the last part of the paper some attention is paid to uncertainty problems with respect to the constraints subject to which maximization or minimization takes place.
