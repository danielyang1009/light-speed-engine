## 1. Mobilizing Management Science Resources
### Author(s):
- David B. Hertz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
As you know, the objectives of The Institute of Management Sciences are to identify, unify, and extend scientific knowledge that contributes to the understanding and improvement of management practice. Any one of us, I am sure, would like to be able to look back and feel that during these formative years we had used our resources wisely and effectively to work toward an understanding of the management process. Any of us would hope that we had indeed added to the extension and unification of knowledge with the spirit if not the genius of Galileo, as he exemplified those qualities perhaps best of all in his last work, Dialogues on the Two New Sciences. But winning acceptance of truly significant scientific ideas is hardly less difficult in our own time than it was in his. And while we like to think that our enlightened modern contemporaries move in a smooth and continuous transition in adopting major scientific advances, our experience shows repeatedly that they do not.

## 2. Some Growth Considerations of Research and Development and the National Economy
### Author(s):
- Herbert K. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
This paper considers some of the relationships among growth in expenditures for research and development and growth of the national econony measured in terms of gross national product. The associated requirement for scientific and engineering personnel is discussed. It is shown that the relationships developed from a simple growth model are generally consistent with what is currently known about economic growth rates and R&D growth rates in a number of countries.

## 3. Mathematical Analysis of Rates of Return Under Certainty
### Author(s):

- Alexander A. Robichek
- Michael Montalbano
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to prove certain properties of the present and future values of a sequence of cash flows which have applications in the theory of capital budgeting. This is done in Theorems III, IV and V. As an introduction, certain previously available results about the present value function are stated and proved as Theorems I and II. A summary of the relevance of these results in capital budgeting is given in the Summary.

## 4. Portfolio Analysis in a Stable Paretian Market
### Author(s):
- Eugene F. Fama
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
Recently evidence has come forth which suggests that empirical probability distributions of returns on securities conform better to stable Paretian distributions with infinite variances than to the normal distribution. Using a generalized form of a technique proposed by Sharpe [17] in a recent issue of this journal, this article develops a portfolio analysis model for a stable Paretian market. The article also shows the range of conditions under which diversification is a meaningful economic activity, even though probability distributions of returns on individual securities have infinite variances.

## 5. Special Simplex Algorithm for Linked Problems
### Author(s):
- A. R. G. Heesterman
- J. Sandee
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
This paper describes a variant of the Simplex algorithm, applicable to matrices containing blocks of elements along and just below the diagonal. It uses the emptiness of the other blocks to save space and computation.

## 6. Scheduling with Random Arrivals and Linear Loss Functions
### Author(s):
- Dennis W. Fife
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
The problem under consideration involves scheduling of the processing of an initial queue of jobs and subsequent Poisson arrivals on a single processor. Each job to be processed incurs a loss which increases linearly with its waiting time. The scheduling algorithm is sought which minimizes the average rate of expected loss over infinite time. It is shown that if statistical equilibrium exists for the total loss of an individual arrival, the optimal schedule minimizes the expected total loss of a single arrival, and is given by the scheduling rule which applies when there are no additional arrivals.

## 7. Risk-Taking in Critical Path Analysis
### Author(s):
- William S. Jewell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
In most PERT scheduling problems, uncertainties in job duration are handeled by a “wait-and-see” formulation in which it is assumed that the samples of job duration are known at the moment of scheduling; much attention has been devoted to the distribution of minimal project time under these assumptions. In this paper, a “here-and-now” formulation is proposed in which the manager takes a risk by fixing the project event times before the job durations are known; based on the allotted time interval, and the actual duration of the job, additional effort may have to be expended to stay on schedule. Under general assumptions, it is shown that minimizing the average total additional effort needed to stay on schedule will result in a cost-time scheduling problem of the CPM type.

## 8. Decomposition of Project Networks
### Author(s):
- Shailendra C. Parikh
- William S. Jewell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
This paper considers “critical path” networks which are used for the planning and scheduling of projects that consist of well defined sequences of individual activities. When the number of activities is large, it becomes difficult to prepare a network for the project as one unit, and it may also be difficult to store the network in the high speed memory of a digital computer. Also, in the cases where there are two or more independent projects, which are weakly inter-related by common activities, the problem of efficient scheduling of all the projects becomes quite difficult.

## 9. Scheduling with Deadlines and Loss Functions on k Parallel Machines
### Author(s):
- James G. Root
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
An optimal schedule is developed for H jobs on K identical machines in single stage production. The optimal schedule minimizes ∑b[max (0, Ai − di)] where Ai is the actual completion time for job i and di is the deadline for job i. A common deadline, t0, is assumed for all jobs, i.e., di = t0, i = 1, …, H.

## 10. Sequencing Operations to Minimize In-Process Inventory Costs
### Author(s):
- William Gapp
- P. S. Mankekar
- L. G. Mitten
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
A solution is presented for the problem of determining the sequence in which a set of manufacturing operations should be carried out in order to minimize in-process inventory costs while meeting a variety of technological constraints. Both strict precedence constraints and contiguity constraints are considered, the latter dealing with the requirement that certain sets of operations be performed contiguously (but without specification of any order).

## 11. Communications to the Editor—Supplement to “The Derivation of Probabilistic Information for the Evaluation of Risky Investments”
### Author(s):
- Frederick S. Hillier
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
This note is intended to clarify an issue that has been raised regarding one section of a recent paper by this writer [Hillier, Frederick S. 1963. The derivation of probabilistic information for the evaluation of risky investments. Management Sci.9 (3, April) 443–457.]. This issue concerns the proposed method for calculating the cumulative distribution function of internal rate of return. The most relevant passages from the paper follow.

## 13. Critical Comments on “Technical Characteristics of Distribution Simulators” By Gerson and Maffei
### Author(s):
- C. Roger Glassey
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1965
### Abstract:
Since this paper by Gerson and Maffei (Gerson, M. L., R. B. Maffei. 1963. Technical characteristics of distribution simulators. Management Sci.11 (3, October) 62–69.) was selected for publication to appeal to those of practical inclination who, like myself, favor the inclusion of applied papers amongst the theoretical ones, it is open to criticism on practical as well as theoretical grounds. My main criticism is directed at the emphasis they placed on the size and complexity of their computer program that allegedly solved this admittedly large and complex problem.
