## 3. Advertising Expenditures in Coupled Markets— A Game-Theory Approach
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1965
### Abstract:
A game-theory approach to advertising expenditures is developed for a situation in which the markets for different products are coupled. By coupling we mean that advertising dollars spent in generating sales for one product have an influence on the sales of another product. Non-cooperative equilibrium solutions are obtained for the case of two competing companies each selling two products in coupled markets. An idealized example might be the case of two automobile manufacturers each of whom sells a low-priced and a high-priced car. Some special cases of the model are developed and extensions indicated.

## 4. On the Need for Improvement in Implementation of O.R.
### Author(s):
- D. G. Malcolm
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1965
### Abstract:
Two major aspects of the difficulty of implementing O.R. results are described: first, the difficulty in assessing the cost of implementation; and secondly, difficulties in successful performance of this phase. It is argued that O.R. should be approached as a continuum of effort, starting with basic research and leading up to implementation or development. This process is described as the Operations Research and Development Process. A procedure for establishing an OR&D program and criteria for initial project selection are described. It is suggested that the projects making up a program, in OR&D be packaged and scrutinized regularly for their contributions to the objectives of the organization.

## 5. Electronics in Management
### Author(s):
- David B. Hertz
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1965
### Abstract:
Since the end of World War II, the single most outstanding development in the world of business has been the economic renaissance of the Free World. From the devastation and dislocation left by 6 years of war, the Western business community has rebuilt and redirected itself in two decades of unparalleled growth and prosperity. The postwar prophets of gloom, who prognosticated postwar collapse and stagnation as in the Great Depression of the 1930s have long since been routed. And a serious economic setback appears now to be less likely than ever. Certainly the business manager of today can look back proudly on a job well done. Clearly this period has been a triumph for the free enterprise system and the traditional concepts and techniques of management.

## 6. The Researcher and The Manager: A Dialectic of Implementation
### Author(s):
- C. W. Churchman
- A. H. Schainblatt
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1965
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to review various opinions and differences of opinion which have been expressed concerning that aspect of research referred to as “implementation.” We have used the term “implementation” to refer to the manner in which the results of scientific effort may come to be used by the manager. The “problem of implementation” is the problem of determining what activities of the scientist and the manager are most appropriate to bring about an effective relationship between the two.

## 12. College News—Committee Report for the Commission on Common Body of Knowledge for CPAs of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
### Author(s):
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1965
### Abstract:
Professional competence in management services is achieved only with an understanding of both scientific techniques of analysis and human behavior. This committee therefore concludes that the accountant's education must include significant work in mathematics, statistics, electronic data processing, behavioral science, business core subjects, and accounting. At least one-half of the accountant's formal university-level study should be of a general scientific and cultural nature. This committee does not believe it possible to properly educate an accountant within the framework of a conventional four-year university-level curriculum in this country. Rather, it concludes that graduate education should constitute a minimum requirement for entrance into the accounting profession.
