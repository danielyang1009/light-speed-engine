## 1. Toward a Theory of Inter-Organizational Relations
### Author(s):
- William M. Evan
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1965
### Abstract:
Social science research has been concerned primarily with intra-organizational phenomena. The twin problems of theory and methodology have impeded research on inter-organizational phenomena. Merton's concept of the “role-set” is the point of departure for an analogous concept designated as the “organization-set.” The unit of analysis is an organization or a class of organizations, referred to as the focal organization, and its interactions are mapped with the network of organizations in its environment, i.e., with elements of its organization-set. Seven dimensions of organization-sets are discussed: input vs. output organization-sets, comparative vs. normative reference organizations; size of the organization-set; concentration of input organizational resources; overlap in membership; overlap in goals and values; and boundary personnel. With the aid of these dimensions, hypotheses are formulated concerning the variable of autonomy in decision-making of the focal organization. Similar hypotheses—several of which are set forth—are needed for various inter-organizational processes, such as coordination, cooperation, competition, conflict, and amalgamation. Two methodological tools which may prove useful in empirical research on inter-organizational relations, graph theory and input-output analysis, are considered.

## 2. Brand Switching and Mathematical Programming in Market Expansion
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1965
### Abstract:
In a number of industries, product is sold through individual outlets under control of a company through lease or franchise. If these individual outlets are independent, in that sales in one have no influence on another, then the decision to add or subtract an outlet in a marketing area rests solely on investment and cost considerations. If, on the other hand, one outlet has an influence on another in terms of sales, then the decision to expand must take this influence into account. This paper suggests a method for planning expansion systematically and consistently when this influence, which is called market share, is present. The approach taken is that of mathematical programming where the objective function is nonlinear. The solution suggested here is one of iteration which has worked well for problems studied by the authors. A theoretical model, based on brand switching, is validated by experimental evidence and these results are then employed in the development of a long-term planning model.

## 3. Stochastic Decision Trees for the Analysis of Investment Decisions
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Hespos
- Paul A. Strassmann
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1965
### Abstract:
This paper describes an improved method for investment decision making. The method, which is called the stochastic decision tree method, is particularly applicable to investments characterized by high uncertainty and requiring a sequence of related decisions to be made over a period of time. The stochastic decision tree method builds on concepts used in the risk analysis method and the decision tree method of analyzing investments. It permits the use of subjective probability estimates or empirical frequency distributions for some or all factors affecting the decision. This application makes it practicable to evaluate all or nearly all feasible combinations of decisions in the decision tree, taking account of both expected value of return and aversion to risk, thus arriving at an optimal or near optimal set of decisions. Sensitivity analysis of the model can highlight factors that are critical because of high leverage on the measure of performance, or high uncertainty, or both. The method can be applied relatively easily to a wide variety of investment situations, and is ideally suited for computer simulation.

## 4. Forest Management and Operational Research: A Linear Programming Study
### Author(s):
- P. A. Wardle
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1965
### Abstract:
In this note the technique known as linear programming is applied to a problem of allocation which involves interaction between particular choices. Many management problems are further complicated by being dynamic—that is involving interaction through time as well as between variables—or they involve uncertainty. Such problems also lend themselves to numerical analysis. Through the description of an example it is hoped to demonstrate that the information available to management is both improved and extended by such analysis.

## 5. The Potential for Office Automation in Department Stores
### Author(s):
- T. T. Kwo
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1965
### Abstract:
Potential for office automation in department stores is explored by sales volume class. This is done in terms of the present-day expenses in the clerical work area and the inventory management area typical of the stores in each volume class. Some characteristics of the “typical” stores are also briefly reviewed. The data used are those given in the Harvard Business School Survey conducted in 1963 [McNair, M. P. 1962. Operating Results of Department and Specialty Stores in 1962. Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.].
