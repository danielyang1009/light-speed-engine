## 1. Maintenance Policies for Stochastically Failing Equipment: A Survey
### Author(s):
- John J. McCall
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
This paper is a survey of scheduling policies for stochastically failing equipment. The development of these policies has relied on a variety of mathematical techniques. This reliance together with the diversity of the applications has sometimes obscured the underlying structure that is common to all these policies. The primary purpose of this survey is to identify this common structure and thereby clarify the relationships existing among the various maintenance policies. With this clarification in mind, it is hoped that the survey will provide a convenient introduction to the problems of scheduling maintenance for equipment subject to stochastic failure.

## 2. Computing Optimal (s, S) Inventory Policies

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
A complete computational approach for finding optimal (s, S) inventory policies is developed. The method is an efficient and unified approach for all values of the model parameters, including a non-negative set-up cost, a discount factor 0 ≦ α ≦ 1, and a lead time. The method is derived from renewal theory and stationary analysis, generalized to permit the unit interval range of values for α. Careful attention is given to the problem associated with specifying a starting condition (when α < 1); a resolution is found that guarantees an (s, S) policy optimal for all starting conditions is produced by the computations. New upper and lower bounds on the optimal values of both s and S are established. The special case of linear holding and penalty costs is treated in detail. In the final section, a model in which there is a minimum guaranteed demand in each period is studied, and a simplified method of solution is developed.

## 3. A Sequence of Two Servers with No Intermediate Queue
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
Customers arriving randomly are served by a queueing system consisting of a sequence of two service stations with infinite queue allowable before the first station and no queue allowable between the stations. The moment generating functions of the steady-state queueing times as well as the generating functions of the steady-state numbers of customers in the various parts of the system are obtained under assumptions of Poisson process of arrivals and arbitrarily distributed service times at both stations. The cases of regular and exponential service times are investigated in some more detail, and the results obtained are extended to include the queueing system with a sequence of two stations with a finite intermediate queue allowable between them, infinite queue allowed before the first station, Poisson process of arrivals and regular service times at both stations.

## 4. A Sequence of Service Stations with Arbitrary Input and Regular Service Times
### Author(s):
- B. Avi-Itzhak
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
In a queuing system with an ordered sequence of stations, the arrivals process is arbitrary and service times are regular at all stations. The case where each station consists of the same number of servers in parallel and the service times at all servers belonging to one station are the same is investigated and shown to possess the following properties: (a) The time spent in the system by any customer is independent of the order of the stations and of the allowable sizes of the intermediate queues; (b) The waiting time (not including service) of any customer equals the time the same customer would have been waiting in the queue of a single station system with regular service time, equaling the longest service time of the sequence (assuming the same arrivals process in both systems). These properties enable one to obtain waiting time distributions and other characteristics of such queuing processes.

## 6. Capacity Expansion with Facilities Under Technological Improvement
### Author(s):
- Hirohide Hinomoto
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
Practically all existing analyses covering the obsolescence or the improvement of productive facilities are concerned with equipment replacement. An extension of such considerations to general capital investment analysis would seem to be a natural development.

## 7. Operations Research in the USSR as Education and Research Work
### Author(s):
- Ivan M. Siroyezhin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1965
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general discussion of operations research education with special attention to the program of the Department of Mathematical Economics1 at Leningrad University. The influence of the dual aims of providing students with knowledge and professional skills and developing desirable social objectives on curricular development are traced. Some comparisons between OR educational program in the U.S.S.R. and elsewhere are made. The flavor of the program is somewhat indicated by descriptions of student research projects.
