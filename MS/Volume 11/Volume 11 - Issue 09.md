## 1. Intention and Performance: A Primer of Cybernetics of Planning
### Author(s):
- Henryk Greniewski
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
It is claimed that the object of a plan is always a relatively isolated prospective system: the goal is a certain state of the output; the means are the states of the controlled inputs; and the circumstances under which the goal is to be attained are the states of the uncontrolled inputs.

## 2. Solvable Nuclear War Models
### Author(s):
- Norman C. Dalkey
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper deals with an aggregated, two-sided war game, one of several designed to study the use of abstract models for strategic planning. A payoff function for the war game is defined making use of an assumption of increasing concern as a critical level of damage is approached. A very simple, one-weapon version of the central nuclear war game has an analytic solution, indicating the existence of a stable (equilibrium) point in pure strategies if each side has a nonnegligible counterforce capability.

## 3. Independence, Trade-Offs, and Transformations in Bivariate Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper explores several important notions relevant to modern utility theory. Restricting the discussion to the consideration of bivariate utility functions, the paper defines and examines the interrelationships between (1) independence in the utility sense, (2) trade-off or indifference curves, and (3) transformation curves (as defined herein).

## 4. Some Operations Research Applications in the Conservation of Wildland Resources
### Author(s):
- A. Broido
- R. J. McConnen
- W. G. O'Regan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper was written to indicate some of the limited O.R. work done on wildland problems and to call attention to the ever-increasing opportunity for more effort. The first example presents a beginning approach to the problem of minimizing wildland fire costs—one which shows that a sizable increase in prevention and presuppression activities can lead to considerable savings if total costs include fire losses. The second example challenges the commonly used strategy of insect pest control—in large part because of the non-Markovian nature of the problem. The third example deals with the application of linear programming to the problem of managing a wildland area as a continuing source of one or more products or services. Finally, two examples of simulation techniques—applied to forest management and forest sampling—are described briefly.

## 5. Models for Appraising Investments Yielding Stochastic Return
### Author(s):
- D. P. Gaver, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper provides models for economic enterprises or projects whose returns vary randomly in time and which are subject to termination or “ruin” provided assets or net worth fall to a prescribed level. In particular, strategies for dealing with environmental changes, innovations, and catastrophe are considered.

## 6. Non-Linear Programming with Randomization
### Author(s):
- Stan Fromovitz
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper considers non-linear programming models in which randomized solutions are allowed. That is, we consider the minimization of the expected value of a non-linear function subject to constraints on the expectation of nonlinear functions, where the expectations are taken with respect to randomized decision strategies. Saddle-point and related optimality conditions similar to those given in [Karlin, S. 1959. Mathematical Methods and Theory in Games, Programming, and Economics, Vol. 1, Chapter 7, Addison-Wesley.] and [Kuhn, H. W., A. W. Tucker. 1951. Nonlinear programming. Proceedings of the Second Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability. University of California Press, 481–492.] for convex functions are obtained with only very mild restrictions on the shape of the optimizing and constraint functions. We also consider when the optimal solution need not be randomized and how the notions of Lagrange multipliers and game theory are related to our results. We offer an economic interpretation of our solution. A few simple examples are given to illustrate the implications of randomized strategies. It is also pointed out how the results of this paper are related to the decomposition methods widely used to solve mathematical programming problems.

## 7. Mathematical Solution of Parts Requirements Problems
### Author(s):
- Bernard Giffler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
This paper describes a matrix algebraic theory and techniques for defining and solving general parts requirements problems. These include problems to check bills of materials for feasibility, to generate and up-date total requirements, to explode the gross requirements necessary to produce a given product mix, to net the gross requirements against surplus inventory and to generate the capacity and cost restraints in LP models to determine optimal product and resource mixes. The intent of the work is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate the use of matrix algebraic techniques to speed and compact the logical and numerical operations in solving parts requirements problems and (2) to develop a concise and unambiguous mathematical theory for parts requirements problems so that production engineers, mathematicians and programmers can cooperate more easily in their definition and solution.

## 8. Simple And Combined Inventory Policies, Production to Stock or to Order?
### Author(s):
- W. Popp
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
In an inventory model three strategies can be applied, where two of the strategies are simple and one is a combination of the simple strategies. Conditions for preferences between the strategies are discussed. The problem in planning inventories and production is, to decide between production to stock, production to order and production partly to stock and partly to order.

## 9. Optimal Programming of Lot Sizes, Inventory and Labor Allocations
### Author(s):
- Bernard P. Dzielinski
- Ralph E. Gomory
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
The economic lot size programming problem, as studied originally by A. S. Manne and later by B. P. Dzielinski, C. T. Baker and A. S. Manne, is the problem of making economic lot size, inventory and work force decisions in a multi-production process. When several thousand distinct items are involved, the large number of equations that result from the linear programming formulation makes computation infeasible. Also, a large number of variables are involved because of inclusion of alternative set-up sequences for each item. In this paper, the application of the Dantzig and Wolfe decomposition principle and a method for creating alternative set-up sequences as they are needed by means of a computation of the Wagner and Whitin type is described as a method for overcoming the computational difficulty.

## 10. Communications to the Editor—Note on the Problem of Lump-Sum Losses in Sales Training
### Author(s):
- Lawrence Harris
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1965
### Abstract:
Companies that organize large scale training programs for technical salesmen often find that a certain proportion of these salesmen do not complete the program. Thus, at the completion of the program the company finds itself short of the required number of trained salesmen, unless it has originally hired more technical salesmen than it requires. This note discuses a decision-theoretic approach to this problem of overhiring; that is, how many trainees should be hired in order to have the right number of trained salesmen at completion of the training program and still minimize variable training costs.
