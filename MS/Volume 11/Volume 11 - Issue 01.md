## 1. Decomposition, Pricing for Decentralization and External Economies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
The decomposition procedure for the solution of large scale linear programs is described in an elementary manner with illustrative calculations. Its economic interpretation as a procedure for decentralized decision by the multi-division firm or the multi-sector economy is explained in detail. Decomposition is shown to provide internal prices for decentralized decision making in the presence of external economies or diseconomies. However, it is demonstrated that in many cases there exist no prices which will lead divisions to make independent decisions that are optimal from the point of view of the company (or the economy) as a whole.

## 2. The Transportation Problem with Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- Wlodzimierz Szwarc
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
The transportation problem with stochastic demand is considered when penalties are paid for each oversupplied and undersupplied unit of product. The transportation plan minimizing the total transportation costs plus total expected penalty cost of both kinds is to be found. The paper presents a method of solution which is preceded by a development that replaced the original cost function with a controlled linear approximation.

## 3. Dynamic Modeling of Inventories Subject to Obsolescence
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
A class of models for optimizing inventory costs is presented which takes account of stochastic obsolescence of an inventory item. Obsolescence is defined as a demand state, in such a fashion as to permit appraisal, ex ante, of the probability of arrival of obsolescence at future times, under the assumption that there are many possible states of demand. Response to obsolescence is introduced by means of a Bayesian procedure. In the most complete model this is done by modification of the state probability vector of a Markov process. Optimization is accomplished by means of a dynamic program.

## 5. Optimal Resource Use Over Time with an Application to Ground Water
### Author(s):
- Oscar R. Burt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with optimal allocation over time of a single resource which is either fixed in supply or only partially renewable at a point in time. Some resources which fall in this category are mineral deposits, ground water, petroleum, wildlife, and fish. A functional equation is obtained from a dynamic programming formulation of the problem. This functional equation is used to derive approximate decision rules for resource use as a function of current supply. The results are applied to ground water storage control and tested empirically by comparison with a decision rule obtained by detailed numerical methods.

## 6. Allocation of Research and Development Resources in U.S. and Israel Industry
### Author(s):
- Burton V. Dean
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
This paper considers the allocation of national technological resources to different sectors of the economy. The impact of economic investments in technology is related to national, industry, and company growth. In some sectors of the economy investments in research and development (R and D) are well below the saturation level, where increasing the investment level and fraction of scientific and engineering manpower devoted to R and D may be expected to yield increased economic growth. A comparison is made of the sources and consumers of R and D funds in the U.S. and Israel, particularly as related to size of firms. Conclusions are obtained in the form of magnitude and allocation of R and D investments and utilization of scientific and engineering manpower for industrial R and D in Israel.

## 7. Economic Effects of Technological Innovations
### Author(s):
- Bela Gold
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
This paper reports on research which is both historical and analytical. The historical aspect of this study comprehends the years 1899-1939 and reports on the behavior of costs, wages, output and related physical measures in 5 basic industries plus “all manufacturing.” Generally speaking the ratios of labor and capital inputs to total output during this period do not show the kinds of “substitution effects” that might have been expected during the period covered. The data indicate that technological innovation and investment were, in fact, neutral in terms of labor-capital ratios which prevailed during this period. These are, of course, only long-run phenomena. Transient patterns generally produce changes in the physical ratios which, however, are subsequently offset in value terms. Furthermore only industry aggregates are examined. Evidently, then, any individual firm may find itself out of line with these ratios at any moment of time depending on its status as an innovator, follower, etc.

## 8. A Study of Management Behavior by Use of Competitive Business Games
### Author(s):
- Gifford H. Symonds
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
A general model has been developed for a class of business games to represent the activities of individual firms in a hypothetical oligopolistic industry. Although hypothetical, the games allow the players to transfer mentally to the real business world. The players who act as competitors build and operate their individual plants with specified technology to produce a single homogeneous product. The product is sold competitively to households, and labor supplied by the households is employed in the industry through competitive bidding of the competitors. Thus, there are two competitive markets established, with the firms competing for a limited supply of labor on the one hand, and competing for a limited sales fund on the other hand. Managerial decisions for each firm include labor employment offerings and wage rate, product sales offerings and product prices, production and inventory, plant expansion, money borrowing, sales credit, and dividends paid to stockholders. In some cases there is a market for “efficiency units” used to improve technology. The competitors may select wage rates and product prices freely, since there are no internal relationships in the model. Aggressive competition for labor results in increasing wage rates and aggressive competition for the sales fund results in low product profit. Various regulations are introduced concerning monopoly, taxation, credit, and bankruptcy. The general results of this study show that managerial behavior in an oligopoly exhibits varying strength of agressive competition producing the usual business cycle, and further that competitors will act to “stabilize” the industry by self-regulation of speculative activities. An examination of the technological input to these business games shows that competitors will invest funds to improve efficiency only when their marginal utility of money is well below that represented by the fixed interest rate.

## 9. The Generalized Stepping Stone Method for the Machine Loading Model
### Author(s):
- Kurt Eisemann
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
This paper gives a detailed description of an algorithm for the solution of a specialized Linear Programming model, to be called the Machine Loading model. It is a generalization of the Transportation Problem, in that weighting factors are applied to the individual elements which form the row and column sums.

## 10. Topology and Computation of the Generalized Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Janice R. Lourie
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
The topology of the Generalized Transportation Problem, at the end of each iteration of the stepping-stone method, is characterized by a variable number of loops to which are attached multiple branched side chains or trees. An efficient computer representation of this structure and methods for updating it are described in this paper.

## 11. On the Generalized Transportation Problem
### Author(s):

- P. L. Ivanescu
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1964
### Abstract:
The purpose of the present paper is to extend the loop-technique of the stepping-stone algorithm to the generalized transportation problem. The main result (Theorem and Corollary of §6) is, that passing from a basic feasible solution to another one may always be carried out by constructing a simple symmetrical or a double loop (as defined in §2) and computing new values for the variables only along this path. The amount of computations needed for this turns out to be substantially reduced as compared to the usual way of solving the system of equations relating the new basis to the old one.
