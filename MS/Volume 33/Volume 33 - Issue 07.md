### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper contains a new and very successful application of mathematical programming in the petroleum industry. Specifically, the paper describes the design and implementation of a model and computer system to address the complex short-term planning and operational issues associated with the supply, distribution, and marketing of refined petroleum products. This system has been successfully implemented at Citgo Petroleum Corporation. The benefits include a $116 million reduction (based on historical inventory-to-sales ratios) in product inventories resulting in a $14 million per year reduction in working capital costs and an additional $2.5 million per year estimated contribution to bottom line profits due to multiple supply, distribution, and marketing insights provided by the system.

## 2. An Integer Programming Approach and Implementation for an Electric Utility Capacity Planning Problem with Renewable Energy Sources

### Abstract:
This paper presents an integer programming model and algorithm for an electric utility capacity expansion problem which considers the option of investing in nondispatchable or renewable energy sources. A branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed for this problem in which the continuous relaxation of the subproblem associated with each node in the enumeration tree is solved via an efficient two-phase procedure. This procedure solves a deterministic approximation of the problem in the first phase in order to determine a quick near-optimal solution. The resulting solution is subsequently refined in a second phase using more accurate techniques to represent the negative load due to the renewable sources, and to perform the probabilistic production costing. This technique conserves about 80% of the effort which would be required without the deterministic phase. An implementation of this approach is described for the Tijuana-Mexicali subsystem of the Mexican utility, which is not connected to the rest of the Mexican electric system, and which faces a very high summer peak load and a comparatively low winter load. The results suggest that along with a prescribed capacity expansion of conventional equipments, the utility should invest in some solar cooling systems, and, more pertinently, should involve itself intensely in conservation measures in homes of individual customers.

## 3. Multiperiod Financial Planning
### Author(s):
- David P. Brown
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1987
### Abstract:
A new algorithm for asset allocation is developed. The algorithm provides consistent approximations to the optimal savings allocations which are dependent upon personal characteristics such as age and income. Numerical analysis is used to solve an individual's lifetime consumption-investment problem on an annual basis within a context of complete markets and nonmarketable income. The investment opportunity set approximates that which was available (expost) during the 19261981 period. Relative risk aversion in wealth is highest for the elderly, lowest for the middle aged (less than  of that of the elderly) with young adults in the midrange despite the imposition of additive isoelastic utility of consumption. Moreover, the sensitivity of optimal portfolio proportions to changes in the opportunity set is greatest for the middle aged.

## 4. Performance Evaluation of State-Owned Enterprises in Theory and Practice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1987
### Abstract:
This study explores the goal orientation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with a view to develop a behavioral theory of SOEs. It is set in India, where as in many other countries the government expects SOEs to promote the public interest rather than maximize profits.

## 5. Minimizing Mean Squared Deviation of Completion Times About a Common Due Date

### Abstract:
This paper addresses a nonpreemptive single machine scheduling problem where all jobs have a common due date and have zero ready time. The scheduling objective is to minimize mean squared deviation (MSD) of job completion times about the due date. This nonregular measure of performance is appropriate when earliness and tardiness are both penalized, and when large deviations of completion time from the due date are undesirable. A special case of the MSD problem, referred to as the unconstrained MSD problem, is shown to be equivalent to the completion time variance problem (CTV) studied by Merten and Muller (Merten, A. G., M. E. Muller. 1972. Variance minimization in single machine sequencing problems. Management Sci.18(September) 518528.) and Schrage (Schrage, L. 1975. Minimizing the time-in-system variance for a finite jobset. Management Sci.21(May) 540543.). Strong results for this latter problem are combined with several new propositions to develop a reasonably efficient procedure for solving the unconstrained MSD problem. This enables us to improve the existing procedures for the CTV problem. We also propose a branching procedure for the constrained MSD problem and present computational results.

## 6. A Heuristic Procedure for the Layout of a Large Number of Facilities
### Author(s):
- Zvi Drezner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1987
### Abstract:
A new approach to the solution of the facilities layout problem on the plane is presented in this paper. A simple procedure that can replace the dispersion phase of DISCON is constructed. The result of the new method is a scatter diagram of the facilities on the plane that can be used by practitioners as guidelines for planning the layout. Since the method is simple and effective, large layout problems can be solved efficiently by it.

## 7. Discounted and Per Unit Costs of Product Warranty
### Author(s):
- John W. Mamer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1987
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a detailed model of the costs and benefits to producers and consumers of product warranty. Three common types of product warranty contract are considered. In addition, we explicitly allow for randomness in consumer repurchase behavior and for the possibility of an independent damage process acting on products sold under warranty. The cost criteria considered are discounted costs (profits) and per unit costs (and profits). The model is used to analyze the trade-off between warranty and quality control, and to illustrate the sensitivity of warranty costs to environmental variables.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1987
### Abstract:
The overflow process from a G/M/N/K queueing system with a stationary counting arrival process, Markovian service times, N parallel homogeneous servers, and K waiting spaces, is asymptotically approximated by a two parameter method. Numerical results are presented and approximation outcomes are compared against those from a simulation study.
