## 1. A Diffusion Theory Model of Adoption and Substitution for Successive Generations of High-Technology Products
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
This study deals with the dynamic sales behavior of successive generations of high-technology products. New technologies diffuse through a population of potential buyers over time. Therefore, diffusion theory models are related to this demand growth. Furthermore, successive generations of a technology compete with earlier ones, and that behavior is the subject of models of technological substitution. Building upon the Bass (Bass, F. M. 1969. A new-product growth model for consumer durables. Management Sci.15(January) 215227.) diffusion model, we develop a model which encompasses both diffusion and substitution. We demonstrate the forecasting properties of the model by estimating parameters over part of the data and projecting shipments for later periods.

## 2. Risk and the Relationship Among Strategy, Organizational Processes, and Performance
### Author(s):
- David B. Jemison
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Performance is an important variable in strategic management research. But, although managers must deal with performance on two dimensions, its level (return) and the variation in that level (risk), performance has traditionally been studied only in terms of return. This paper reports the results of a study of business strategy content and processes where performance was operationalized as both return and risk.

## 3. Strategic Group Formation and Performance: The Case of the U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry, 19631982
### Author(s):
- Karel O. Cool
- Dan Schendel
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
The focus of this paper is on three major questions: (1) what is the theoretical rationale for the strategic group concept?; (2) does strategic group membership have performance implications?; and (3) are strategic groups and membership in strategic groups stable characteristics of industries? A statistical procedure is proposed to longitudinally identify strategic groups. The empirical setting is the U.S. pharmaceutical industry over the period 196382. While performance differences are found in terms of market share, profitability differences between groups are not observed. Neither are differences found in terms of risk and risk-adjusted performance. These results are attributed to the existence of performance variation within each strategic group. A dynamic model of competitive repositioning is proposed which helps integrate the findings from the study.

## 4. Simultaneous Determination of Production Cycle and Inspection Schedules in a Production System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Classical Economic Manufacturing Quantity (EMQ) models have usually ignored the possibility of process deterioration and the existence of defective items in the production lot. Moreover, the use of machine inspection for maintenance and restoration purposes has not been considered. On the other hand, past studies on maintenance models do not consider the length of a production run to be a decision variable. This paper addresses the problem of joint control of production cycles or manufacturing quantities and maintenance by inspection. A simple relationship has been developed to determine the effectiveness of maintenance by inspection. Furthermore, when maintenance by inspection is adopted, it is shown that the optimal inspection intervals are equally-spaced. The problem of simultaneous determination of EMQ and the inspection schedules is solved by using an approximation to the cost function. The resulting EMQ is found to be an adjustment to the classical EMQ. Finally, the relationships between different parameter values and the magnitudes of the cost penalty for using the classical EMQ are examined.

## 5. Freezing the Master Production Schedule Under Rolling Planning Horizons
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
The stability of the Master Production Schedule (MPS) is a critical issue in managing production operations with a Material Requirements Planning System. One method of achieving stability is to freeze some portion or all of the MPS. While freezing the MPS can limit the number of schedule changes, it can also produce an increase in production and inventory costs. This paper examines three decision variables in freezing the MPS: the freezing method, the freeze interval length, and the planning horizon length. Simulation experiment results are reported which suggest that freezing up to 50% of the planning horizon has a marginal effect on production and inventory cost under a wide range of operating conditions. These results also suggest that an order based freezing method produces superior results in comparison with a period based method.

## 6. Eliminating Inventory in a Series Facility Production System
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Zero inventory (ZI) and the related concepts of Just in Time and Kanban are innovative and powerful means to improve production efficiency. This paper applies these concepts to a series facility production system and, in particular, identifies which facilities will never hold inventory irrespective of product demand. Pinpointing beforehand that certain facilities will have no inventory can simplify such strategic decisions as facility design, site location, and space utilization, plus it eases production scheduling. Next, a procedure is developed which increases the number of facilities that will never hold inventory. This procedure implements the ZI philosophy of cutting set up costs to increase efficiency.

## 7. Reducing the Congestion in a Class of Job Shops
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Consider a job shop that is modelled as an open queueing network of the Jackson (Jackson, J. R. 1957. Networks of waiting lines. Oper. Res.5 518521.) type. All work stations in the shop have the same number of parallel servers. Two problems are studied: the loading of stations and the assignment of servers, which are represented by loading and assignment vectors, respectively. Majorization and arrangement orderings are established to order, respectively, the loading and the assignment vectors. It is shown that reducing the loading vector under majorization or increasing the assignment vector under arrangement ordering will reduce the congestion in the shop in terms of reducing the total number of jobs (in the sense of likelihood ratio ordering), the maximum queue length (in the sense of stochastic ordering), and the queue-length vector (in the sense of stochastic majorization). The results can be used to support production planning in certain job shops, and to aid the design of storage capacity.

## 8. Optimal Server Allocation in a System of Multi-Server Stations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Consider a closed queueing network (Gordon and Newell [Gordon, W. J., G. F. Newell. 1967. Closed queueing networks with exponential servers. Oper. Res.15 252267.]) with a set of stations. The service rate at each station is an increasing concave function of the number of jobs at that station. Suppose there also exists a station that has c (1) parallel servers, each of which has a fixed service rate. We show that the throughput of this network is an increasing concave function with respect to c. This result is then applied to solve the optimal server allocation problem in a system of multi-server stations with a fixed buffer capacity (for the total number of jobs) at each station. For a single-station system, the simultaneous optimal allocation of both servers and buffer capacity is also studied.

## 9. Developing Competitive Strategies for Buyer-Supplier Negotiations
### Author(s):
- Jonathan F. Bard
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Using differential game theory, a model is developed to analyze the dynamics accompanying buyer-supplier negotiations. Two cases are examined: the first supposes that the players bargain cooperatively and try to reach Pareto-optimal solutions; the second assumes a noncooperative atmosphere and seeks out Nash equilibria. Although the latter are not necessarily efficient, they do provide a measure of stability, and hence may be considered a conservative strategy. In either case, the buyer and supplier are bargaining over n issues with a view toward minimizing their individual costs. These costs are represented by a linear combination of the terminal offer or bid, and the cumulative losses incurred during the negotiating process. In the analysis, closed form solutions are obtained for a variety of structural and behavioral assumptions. For certain Nash equilibria it is shown that agreement is reached on all issues simultaneously. The results can be used to evaluate the performance of different strategies, as well as check for suboptimality.

## 10. Simulating GI/G/k Queues in Heavy Traffic
### Author(s):
- Do Le Minh
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new consistent estimator for the expected waiting time in queue in the simulation of a multiserver queueing system. This estimator is called the error estimator because it estimates only the error involved in the use of Kingman's heavy traffic approximation. Not only does this estimator retain all the advantages of the regenerative method, but it also reduces the variance of the estimator substantially when the traffic becomes heavy.

## 11. A Study of Graphical and Tabular Displays and Their Interaction with Environmental Complexity
### Author(s):
- William Remus
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1987
### Abstract:
Since most interactive systems use either graphical or tabular displays, this experiment contrasts the effectiveness of the two displays in making the production scheduling decision in low and intermediate levels of environmental complexity. The study concludes that tabular aids outperform the graphical aids in environments with low complexity, replicating an earlier study. In intermediate complexity environments, the graphical aids outperform the tabular aids. These findings may resolve many conflicts in the literature on data displays.
