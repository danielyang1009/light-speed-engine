## 1. Counting Your Customers: Who-Are They and What Will They Do Next?
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This article is concerned with counting and identifying those customers who are still active. The issue is important in at least three settings: monitoring the size and growth rate of a firm's ongoing customer base, evaluating a new product's success based on the pattern of trial and repeat purchases, and targeting a subgroup of customers for advertising and promotions. We develop a model based on the number and timing of the customers' previous transactions. This approach allows computation of the probability that any particular customer is still active. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate applications of the model.

## 2. Cash Transfer Scheduling for Concentrating Noncentral Receipts
### Author(s):
- M. Anvari
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
Cash concentration is a routine cash management activity that concerns transfer of funds from bank accounts in remote locations to the firm's central bank accounts. Substantial savings can accrue to the company as a result of properly scheduling these transfers, i.e. determining the optimal timing and amount of cash transfers. In this paper an easy to implement model is developed to aid management in this activity. The transfer policy is shown to be a day-specific (s, S) policy which is amenable to efficient computerization. This result is shown to hold under a set of realistic assumptions regarding deposit patterns, various cost functions, and institutional arrangements.

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
There has been a great deal of interest recently in the Japanese approach to manufacturing, growing out of a concern for finding ways to reduce inventories and increase productivity. At this project's inception, its objective was to assess whether the kanban system could perform well in the manufacturing environments found in this country. Based on observations from managers visiting Japan, the project was enlarged to also assess which factors in a production environment have the biggest impact on performanceregardless of the system in use.

## 4. An Algorithm for Technology Choice in Local Area Network Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
Technological advances in both the manufacturing and office sectors have emphasized the need to link processors and communications equipment into Local Area Networks (LANs) to facilitate communication and promote resource sharing. Interviews with designers and users of LANs revealed that a primary problem in the acquisition of a LAN is making technology choices in a cost effective manner when the available technologies and their costs are constantly changing. Since no standards for technology choice currently exist and user demand is expected to increase, system flexibility is also an important concern. The problem of technology choice is formulated as a dynamic integer program. Because of the numerous combinations of technology and network configuration pairings, the Sweeney-Tatham reduction method is utilized to reduce the problem to a computationally tractable size. Finally, the formation is applied to the actual case of an institutional user seeking to network 29 buildings. The resulting reduced problem can be solved on a microcomputer as a shortest path problem.

## 5. A Methodology for Determining a Hospital's Expected Costs for Changes in Patient Load and Service Mix
### Author(s):
- Peter Duchessi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
This paper describes a methodology that demonstrates how specific types of patient/cost data can be used to construct a model that predicts the expected increase or decrease in costs associated with a change in patient load, expansion of an existing patient service department, closure of an existing patient service department, or installation of a specific patient service department. Data from a group of New York State hospitals are used to illustrate the development of the model's components that produce cost estimates. A computer-based model is used to demonstrate the methodology's application to a specific hospital. Additionally, a number of program runs that simulate the cost impact of patient load and/or service mix changes are presented. Finally, the methodology's potential management and regulatory applications are discussed.

## 6. The Multilocation Multiperiod Inventory Problem: Bounds and Approximations
### Author(s):
- Uday S. Karmarkar
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
The multilocation inventory problem can be thought of naturally as an extension of the single location newsboy problem to multiple locations with transshipment possible between locations. Previous work has established the form of optimal policies; however, computational results have been limited to the one-period case or to special structures. This paper develops lower- and upper-bounds for the general multiperiod problem. These also suggest approximations to the optimal solution. Computational methods are discussed and tested on small problems.

## 7. Setting Planned Leadtimes in Serial Production Systems with Tardiness Costs
### Author(s):
- Candace Arai Yano
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
We investigate the problem of determining optimal planned leadtimes in serial production systems in which the actual procurement and processing times may be stochastic. The objective is to minimize the sum of inventory holding costs and job tardiness costs given a customer specified due-date. We present a general solution procedure for two stage serial systems, which for most cost structures and leadtime distributions is a single-pass algorithm. We also indicate how the procedure can be extended to N-stage systems. We present computational results which provide some insight into the characteristics of optimal safety time policies.

## 8. Adaptive Coordination of a Learning Team
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
Contemporary research on organizations has cast doubt on the extent to which organizations can be expected to adapt to their environments through rational, anticipatory action. Incremental experiential learning has been suggested as an alternative form of organizational intelligence, less demanding cognitively yet capable of considerable power. This paper examines such learning in the context of a model of a team involving two learning members, each of whom modifies beliefs about the other on the basis of experience, and an adaptive coordinator who adjusts a coordination control variable. It is shown that although learning is a powerful mechanism for improving organizational performance, it can often be confounded by the effects of attributional biases on the part of members, by the interactions of simultaneous learning by the members and the coordinator, and by errors in perceiving or interpreting experience. These complications lead to consideration of possible heuristics to overcome such learning liabilities. It is suggested that the effectiveness of incremental learning can often be improved by slowing the rate of learning and adaptation, by reducing the simultaneity of behavioral changes, and by scaling the size of the changes.

## 9. Price Indexes for R and D Inputs, 19691983
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1987
### Abstract:
This paper presents the first R and D price indexes based largely on actual prices and expenditures reported by firms. The results, based on a carefully designed sample of about 100 firms, show that the GNP deflator, which is used in the official government R and D statistics, has tended to underestimate the rate of inflation in R and D. For managerial and economic purposes, such as R and D budgeting and productivity studies, these indexes should be of widespread use.

The Dynamic Programming algorithm proposed by Rosenblatt and Kaspi (Rosenblatt, M. J., M. Kaspi. 1985. A dynamic programming algorithm for joint replenishment under general order cost functions. Management Sci.31(March) 369373.) for an optimum partition problem is shown to be incorrect. An alternative Dynamic Programming algorithm is presented for this problem.

### Published:

### Abstract:
Rosenblatt and Kaspi (Rosenblatt, M. J., M. Kaspi. 1985. A dynamic programming algorithm for joint replenishment under general order cost functions. Management Sci.31 (March) 369373.) suggested a dynamic programming algorithm for partitioning a number of items ordered from a single supplier. It was assumed that items belonging to a group have a fixed common ordering cycle. Queyranne (Queyranne, M. 1987. Comment on a dynamic programming algorithm for joint replenishment under general order cost. Management Sci.33 (1, January) 131133.) in his comments on Rosenblatt and Kaspi described the correct dynamic programming algorithm for this optional partitioning problem.
