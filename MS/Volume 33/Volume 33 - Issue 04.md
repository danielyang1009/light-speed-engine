## 1. A Mathematical Programming Approach to a Deterministic Kanban System
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- Li Chang
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we present a mathematical programming model for the Kanban system in a deterministic multi-stage capacitated assembly-tree-structure production setting. We discuss solution procedures to the problem and address three special cases of practical interest.

## 2. Comparing Hierarchical and Nonhierarchical Weighting Methods for Eliciting Multiattribute Value Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
A value tree relating general values and concerns to specific value relevant attributes was constructed to compare three energy options: nuclear, coal, and a combined geothermal and conservation package. Thirty-seven nonexpert subjects provided judgments of the relative importance of attributes in the tree using both hierarchical and nonhierarchical weighting procedures, and they rated the energy options on all attributes and all levels of the tree. From these importance weights and ratings several additive multiattribute value models were constructed and compared with holistic rankings and ratings of the three options.

## 3. Diffusion and Advertising: The German Telephone Campaign
### Author(s):

- Karl-Heinz Sebastian
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
The goal of the present paper is to investigate the influence of advertising on the diffusion of new telephones in West Germany. Several alternative ways of integrating advertising into the well-known Bass-diffusion-model are suggested and empirically tested.

## 4. A Game-Theoretic Model of Corporate Takeovers by Major Stockholders
### Author(s):
- Imelda Yeung Powers
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
This paper models the exchange between cash and decision power among all stockholders in a company with two major stockholders. It investigates the feasibility and profitability of corporate takeovers, and shows the existence, under some conditions, of pairs of Nash equilibrium strategies that result in one major stockholder taking control of the company. Finally, it solves for threat-resistant strategies (takeover offers that will not be outbid) for both major players, and concludes with a threat-resistant Nash equilibrium solution to the model.

## 5. A Stochastic Dynamic Nash Game Analysis of Policies for Managing the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of Consuming Nations
### Author(s):

- Howard J. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we present a Nash dynamic game model of interactions among oil inventory and tariff policies for oil importing countries. The inventory policies consist of the rates for building up and drawing down strategic oil reserves, while the tariff policies consist of setting tariffs as a function of the state of the world oil market. The model represents a stochastic game in which countries are grouped into two players, where each player in the game chooses its individual policies to maximize expected social welfare. We use the model to present empirical results about the sizes of the stockpiles as a function of disruption probabilities, tariff policies and cooperation versus noncooperation between nations. In addition to results regarding the build-up and draw down rates as a function of the amount of disruption or probability of future disruption our central conclusion is that build-up and drawdown policies are essentially the same with or without international cooperation, due to the current inventory limits on U.S. and Foreign Strategic Petroleum Reserves.

## 6. A Sequential Model of R&D Investment Over an Unbounded Time Horizon
### Author(s):
- Wallace J. Hopp
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
A Markov model of sequential R&D investment, where successful firms are assumed to have an advantage in related follow-on R&D, is formulated and a solution approach is given. Under this assumption, profit maximizing firms must consider the effect of R&D investments on their future market position as well as the direct monetary returns from innovation.

## 7. Manufacturing Strategy, Environmental Uncertainty and Performance: A Path Analytic Model
### Author(s):
- Paul M. Swamidass
- William T. Newell
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
In recent years, researchers and practitioners are paying increasing attention to the phenomenon of manufacturing strategy. However, there exists no formal theory of manufacturing strategy to explain the phenomenon. There is a real need for empirical studies for the development of such a theory. This study takes a step in that direction by clarifying, organizing and integrating terms and concepts relevant to manufacturing strategy in the process of conducting an empirical investigation of key manufacturing strategy variables.

## 8. An Approach for Confirmatory Measurement and Structural Equation Modeling of Organizational Properties
### Author(s):
- James C. Anderson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1987
### Abstract:
A crucial undertaking in research on organizations is to obtain valid estimates of the organization-level constructs and their relationships to one another. One organizational research methodology has multiple individuals within each firm act as informants and report their perceptions of these constructs. Drawing upon past work, a comprehensive, confirmatory measurement approach is presented that enables delineation of the organizational constructs of interest from potential sources of measurement error in multiple informant reports.

## 9. NotesDiscovering Personal Probabilities When Utility Functions are Unknown
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Standard scoring rules require knowledge of the expert's utility function. This note shows how basic reference lottery tickets can be used to develop scoring rules which do not require this information.
