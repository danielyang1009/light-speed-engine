## 1. Lottery Dependent Utility
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we propose a model for decision making under risk that is capable of predicting empirically observed preference patterns that have been found to be incompatible with the expected utility model. The model departs from the classical expected utility model by allowing utilities to depend on the lottery. The dependence of utilities on the lottery being evaluated is achieved by restricting the utility measure to a convenient parametric family of functions. The idea then is to use each lottery to determine a specific parameter value thus characterizing the utility function for each particular lottery. The expected value of this lottery dependent utility function provides the overall measure of preference. The model retains the properties of transitivity, stochastic dominance, and continuity. It also permits types of analyses, such as exploitation of basic attitudes toward risk through risk aversion properties, that have been found useful in decision theory.

## 2. The Theory of Ratio Scale Estimation: Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process
### Author(s):
- Patrick T. Harker
- Luis G. Vargas
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
The Analytic Hierarchy Process developed by Saaty (Saaty, T. L. 1980. The Analytic Hierarchy Process. McGraw-Hill, New York.) has proven to be an extremely useful method for decision making and planning. However, some researchers in these areas have raised concerns over the theoretical basis underlying this process. This paper addresses currently debated issues concerning the theoretical foundations of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. We also illustrate through proof and through examples the validity or fallaciousness of these criticisms.

## 3. Managerial Perspectives on Risk and Risk Taking
### Author(s):

- Zur Shapira
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
This paper explores the relation between decision theoretic conceptions of risk and the conceptions held by executives. It considers recent studies of risk attitudes and behavior among managers against the background of conceptions of risk derived from theories of choice. We conclude that managers take risks and exhibit risk preferences, but the processes that generate those observables are somewhat removed from the classical processes of choosing from among alternative actions in terms of the mean (expected value) and variance (risk) of the probability distributions over possible outcomes. We identify three major ways in which the conceptions of risk and risk taking held by these managers lead to orientations to risk that are different from what might be expected from a decision theory perspective: Managers are quite insensitive to estimates of the probabilities of possible outcomes; their decisions are particularly affected by the way their attention is focused on critical performance targets; and they make a sharp distinction between taking risks and gambling. These differences, along with closely related observations drawn from other studies of individual and organizational choice, indicate that the behavioral phenomenon of risk taking in organizational settings will be imperfectly understood within a classical conception of risk.

## 4. R&D Management and Corporate Financial Policy
### Author(s):
- John B. Guerard, Jr.
- Alden S. Bean
- Steven Andrews
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
The hypothesis that firms simultaneously determine their research and development, investment, dividend, and new debt policies generally is substantiated in the financial literature. The determinants of research and development, dividend, investment and financing decisions of 140 firms are estimated econometrically during the 19781982 period. Management gains insights into the interactions of pursuing research and development expenditures, paying dividends, and undertaking investments.

## 5. Efficient Market Adjustment of Odds Prices to Reflect Track Biases
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
Biases that reflect the economic worth of uncertain contingent claims occur in many financial markets. Parimutuel betting at racetracks is one such market with ample data to investigate such biases. The total wagering market is about $10 billion per year in North America. The configuration of racetracks leads to an advantage for horses breaking from post positions near the rail, especially for tracks with small circumferences. Can the bettor make profits with knowledge of this bias? To investigate, we utilize data from 3,345 races involving over $300 million in wagers from 1982, 1983 and 1984 on win and exotic bets at Exhibition Park in Vancouver where this bias should be strong. The results indicate that the bias exists but the prices adjust to fully negate the potential gains from the bias.

## 6. Optimal Group Maintenance Policies with Continuous and Periodic Inspections
### Author(s):
- David Assaf
- J. George Shanthikumar
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
Optimum group maintenance policies for a set of N machines subjected to stochastic failures under continuous and periodic inspections are considered. Under very general conditions it is shown that a control limit policy minimizes the expected cost per unit time over an infinite horizon, when costs are incurred due to loss of production and repair only. It is also shown how to explicitly compute this control limit. When additional costs are incurred due to inspection, a characterization of an optimal periodic inspection/repair policy that minimizes the expected cost per unit time over an infinite horizon is given.

## 7. A Network Decomposition Approach for Approximating the Steady-State Behavior of Markovian Multi-Echelon Reparable Item Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Donald Gross
- Leonidas C. Kioussis
- Douglas R. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
We develop a method for obtaining approximate steady-state probabilities for large multi-echelon reparable item inventory systems modeled as non-Jacksonian Markovian networks with finite state space. The approximation involves decomposing the network model into smaller overlapping local subnetwork models, solving them in isolation and iterating back and forth among the subnetwork models until convergence is obtained. Numerical results show that the method is quite accurate and efficient for this application.

## 8. Design and Operation of a Multicommodity Production/Distribution System Using Primal Goal Decomposition
### Author(s):
- Gerald G. Brown
- Glenn W. Graves
- Maria D. Honczarenko
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
An optimization-based decision support system has been developed and used by NABISCO to manage complex problems involving facility selection, equipment location and utilization, and manufacture and distribution of products such as the familiar Ritz Crackers, Oreo Cookies, Fig Newtons, etc. (all product names trademarks of NABISCO). A mixed-integer, multi-commodity model is presented for the problems at hand, and a new class of goal decompositions is introduced to yield pure network subproblems for each commodity; the associated master problems have several notable properties which contribute to the effectiveness of the algorithm. Excellent quality solutions for problems with more than 40,000 variables (including several hundred binary variables with fixed charges) and in excess of 20,000 constraints require only 0.6 megabytes region and less than one compute minute on a time-shared IBM 3033 computer; average problems (with fewer binary variables) require only a second or two. The solution method has more to recommend it than sheer efficiency: new insights are given for the fundamental convergence properties of formal decomposition techniques. Several applications of this powerful interactive tool are discussed.

## 9. On Optimal Competitive Contracting
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
We present an example of risk neutral bid-taker and bidders in which the bid-taker obtains a greater expected revenue from auctioning an inefficient contract than from auctioning an efficient contract. This occurs because in going from the efficient contract to an inefficient (but almost efficient) contract, the winning bidder's expected profit decreases faster than the value of the output produced under the contract (net of production costs) decreases. Therefore, the bid-taker's expected revenuethe value of the output less the winning bidder's expected profitincreases.

## 10. Competitive Procurement Under Demand Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Kofi O. Nti
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
Stockpilers of commodities in short supply must frequently contend with game-theoretic ramifications arising from the fact that unit purchasing cost increases with aggregate requirements. In this paper, a competitive inventory procurement model for countries facing uncertain demand is analyzed as a game of strategy. Noncooperative and cooperative aspects of the problem are examined. There are significant incentives for cooperating. Some implications of this analysis for strategic petroleum stockpiling models are discussed.

## 11. NoteAnalyzing Total Factor Productivity with ROI as a Criterion
### Author(s):
- David M. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1987
### Abstract:
This research note concerns total factor productivity measurement at the firm level. Specifically the purpose of the note is to describe a means for incorporating return on investment (ROI) as the improvement criterion in profit-linked total factor productivity measurement procedures. The expressions presented here provide a mechanism to explain changes in profits due to productivity performance beyond the level associated with an ROI goal. This is an extension of existing measurement procedures that utilize gross profit margin rather than ROI as the improvement criterion. The formulation presented here is more appropriate than the margin approach when ROI is the primary financial yardstick of the firm. In presenting this formulation, the ROI based expressions for calculating the type of information derived in a profit-linked total factor productivity measurement procedure will first be given. Then the use of these expressions will be illustrated through a case study.
