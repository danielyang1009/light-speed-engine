## 2. A Heuristic Approach to Product Design
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
A dynamic-programming heuristic is described to find approximate solutions to the problem of identifying a new, multi-attribute product profile associated with the highest share-of-choices in a competitive market. The input data consist of idiosyncratic multi-attribute preference functions estimated using conjoint or hybrid-conjoint analysis. An individual is assumed to choose a new product profile if he/she associates a higher utility with it than with a status-quo alternative. Importance weights are assigned to individuals to account for differences in their purchase and/or usage rates and the performance of a new product profile is evaluated after taking into account its cannibalization of a seller's existing brands. In a simulation with real-sized problems, the proposed heuristic strictly dominates an alternative lagrangian-relaxation heuristic in terms of both computational time and approximation of the optimal solution. Across 192 simulated problems, the dynamic-programming heuristic identifies product profiles whose share-of-choices, on average, are 98.2% of the share-of-choices of the optimal product profile, suggesting that it closely approximates the optimal solution.

### Published:

### Abstract:
We introduce an integrative tool, called a strategy map, for describing the nature of a given competitive environment. The approach can also suggest specific courses of actions for competing businesses in those environments. The strength of the method is its ability to capture and communicate visually through a map the complex relations among competitive strategy variables and performance simultaneously. This article focuses on theory from the strategy field to develop a basic model that ties together the key elements in the development of any competitive strategy map. This theoretical development is followed with an examination of some of the important methodological developments in the field. The article then goes into the statistical development of the methodology. Then the maps are developed through a methodology which captures the simultaneous, multidimensional, and interrelated nature of business strategy and performance for a group of businesses within an industry. Specifically, we (a) present a multidimensional scaling methodology for describing the competitive nature of a given industry, (b) examine the necessary tradeoffs that a competitor must make in targeting its performance goals, and (c) explore the relative importance the different strategy variables have for achieving these performance goals in the given competitive environment. An empirical application using PIMS data is presentedstrategy maps are derived for a mature, industrial supplier to illustrate how the method can be employed as a descriptive tool in competitive strategy. The findings are then validated for a randomly selected business.

## 4. Tests of the Efficiency of Racetrack Betting Using Bookmaker Odds
### Author(s):

- Michael McCrae
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
The objective of this study is to evaluate the informational efficiency of the market for betting on horse races. Whereas the price data used in previous studies have been drawn largely from totalizator (parimutuel) odds, the data used in this study are derived from bookmaker odds. The availability of a series of prices throughout betting facilitates the use of filter tests to evaluate market efficiency. We conclude that this gambling market is efficient in the use of information supplied via both the movements in odds during the course of betting and the selections of newspaper tipsters. However, there is evidence to suggest that those with access to private information can earn positive returns from gambling.

## 5. Dynamic Patent Races with Risky Choices
### Author(s):
- Jaesun Park
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
This paper investigates equilibrium R&D investment strategies of firms endowed with different innovation potentials. To address this issue, this paper permits two stages of innovation and develops a simple stochastic game model involving two firms. It is shown that in equilibrium, a leader in the multiple stage innovation game invests more than a follower; firms compete more vigorously in the later stages of innovation than in the earlier stages; and a follower is more likely to choose a riskier innovation path than one requiring, on average, equivalent effort. It provides an explanation of how the expected benefits, the cost of R&D, and interactions between competing firms combine to determine dynamic R&D strategies over time.

## 6. Testing Behavioral Simulation Models by Direct Experiment
### Author(s):
- John D. Sterman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
The decision rules in simulation models of human behavior purport to describe decision-making behavior as it is and not as it should optimally be. Without the criterion of optimality to judge the appropriateness of a decision rule, simulation modelers must rely on empirical confirmation of the structure of their models. In models of small organizations, traditional social science methods may be used. But these methods are infeasible in models of larger systems such as industries or the macroeconomy. This paper shows how direct experiment can be used to confirm or disconfirm the decision rules in simulation models. Direct experiment uses interactive gaming in which people play a role in the system being modeled. Subjects play the game in an institutional context corresponding to that of the model to be tested, and are given the same information set, but are free to make decisions any way they wish. The behavior of subjects can then be directly compared against the behavior produced by the assumed decision rules of the model. Differences between experiments to test simulation models and experiments in psychology and economics are discussed. The decision rule for capital investment in a simple macroeconomic model is tested as an example of the experimental approach. The model considers interactions between the multiplier and accelerator, a well-known structure underlying popular theories of business fluctuations, but one which has not been tested experimentally. Through their investment decisions, subjects attempt to balance demand and supply over time. The results strongly support the decision rule of the original model. Both model and subjects produce dysfunctional oscillations. The behavior of the subjects is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of the original model. Explanations for the bounded rationality of the subjects' behavior are considered, and the correspondence of the experiment to reality is discussed. The results demonstrate the promise of experimental methods as a complementary approach to econometrics in testing simulation models.

## 7. A Bicriteria Mathematical Programming Model for Nutrition Planning in Developing Nations
### Author(s):
- Harold P. Benson
- Thomas L. Morin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
Mathematical programming models for nutrition planning in developing nations typically involve the optimization of a single criterion function subject to resource and nutritional constraints. The nutritional constraints specify that the amount available of each nutrient for human consumption should meet or exceed some prechosen nutrient requirement level. However, fixed nutrient requirement levels are difficult to prespecify. In this paper, a bicriteria mathematical programming model is proposed which does not require planners to prespecify nutrient requirement levels for several key nutrients. Instead, the model generates an entire set of efficient nutrition plans which supply various amounts of these nutrients. To demonstrate the use and potential benefits of this model, an illustrative application to Colombia, South America is included.

## 8. The Optimal Treatment StrategyA Patient's Perspective
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we present a general model that enables us to better understand the decision of a patient whether or not to participate in a treatment, and, if so, the optimal timing for the treatment, from his point of view. The model takes into account both objective information which represents medical technology as well as subjective information which represents the patient's preference. By doing so it is attuned to the school of thought that medical care is not required for its own sake but for the sake of its effect on health as perceived by the patient himself. The framework presented is used to analyze the optimal decision for the individual for several different cases: One disease-one treatment; one disease-several alternative treatments; many diseases-many treatments; direct payment vs. full insurance; and the effect of the possible future introduction of a better treatment. The optimal decision of treatment for the individual is also analyzed under different assumptions in relation to the parameters. For example, both quality of life in a state of disease and the probability of success of the treatment are constant versus the case where both decrease over time; the comparison between the use of population and individual mortality rates by individuals for decision making; and treatment affecting only quality of life vs. treatment which also affects the individual's life span. The most common decision that results from our model (especially when treatment affects only quality of life) is a bang-bang solution. That is, the optimal timing of a treatment is now or never.

## 9. Multi-Item, One-Warehouse, Multi-Retailer Distribution Systems
### Author(s):

- Robin O. Roundy
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the problem of coordinating the purchase and shipment of I items in a one-warehouse, N-retailer inventory system. The model includes positive echelon holding costs, fixed costs for ordering and shipping each item, and a fixed joint item order cost at each retailer. Demand for each item at each retailer is assumed to occur at a constant and continuous rate. A mathematical model is developed based on these assumptions and the assumption that a stationary nested policy is followed. An efficient algorithm is presented based on the problem's structure that involves only sorting and runs in O(NI log NI) time. The cost of the policy computed is proven to be within 6% of the cost of an optimal nested policy. An example is presented to illustrate the problem structure and the proposed algorithm.

## 10. Optimal Use and the Value of Water Resources in Electricity Generation
### Author(s):
- Prodromos G. Efthymoglou
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
Econometric and dynamic programming analysis is used to derive optimal operating rules for water resources used in electricity generation. The methodology is applied to an actual mixed power system with interconnected thermal and hydro plants. Results obtained are compared with the electricity utility's operating practices. Short-run marginal costs and water values are also derived. The implications of these to efficient pricing of both electricity and water supply are discussed and net effective costs for new generating plants are derived. These costs are important in determining the optimal plant mix.

## 11. NoteComment on: A Generalized Quantity Discount Pricing Model to Increase Supplier's Profits
### Author(s):
- S. K. Goyal
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1987
### Abstract:
Lee and Rosenblatt (Lee, H. L., M. J. Rosenblatt. 1986. A generalized quantity discount pricing model to increase supplier's profits. Management Sci.32 (9) 11771185.) considered the joint problem of ordering and offering discount by a supplier to his sole buyer, the objective of the supplier being to induce the buyer to alter his order quantities in order to increase the supplier's yearly profit. They determined the optimal ordering and pricing policy for the supplier under the constraint on the amount of discount offered to the purchaser. This restriction on the amount of price discount seems unreasonable when the objective of the supplier, in all likelihood, is to increase his own profits. It is possible that higher discounts in purchase price may lead to greater economies for the supplier. In this note, a much simpler approach is being offered for determining the optimal ordering and pricing policy for the supplier.
