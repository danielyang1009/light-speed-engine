## 1. From EOQ Towards ZI
### Author(s):
- Willard I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
Zero Inventory (ZI) is a new and powerful concept to improve production efficiency. Underpinning ZI is set up reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when set up costs are cut. The folklore is that set up reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing set up costs need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering set up costs need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. Set up cost reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of set up cost reduction is provided.

## 2. NoteResponse to Use of Sample Information in Stochastic Recourse and Chance-Constrained Programming Models: On the Bayesability of CCP's
### Author(s):
- Irving H. LaValle
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
Jagannathan's (Jagannathan, R. 1985. Use of sample information in stochastic recourse and chance-constrained programming models. Management Sci.31 96108.) invocation of a utility function for a chance-constrained programming problem [CCPP] produces a Bayesian utility maximation problem [BUMP] which is not equivalent to the given CCPP. Therefore, the nonanomalous behavior shown to characterize information value in the BUMP does not refute examples such as Blau's (Blau, R. A. 1974. Stochastic programming and decision analysis: An apparent dilemma. Management Sci.21 271276.).

## 3. NoteResponse
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
LaValle (LaValle, I. H. 1987. Response to Use of sample information in stochastic recourse and chance-constrained programming models: On the Bayesability of CCP's. Management Sci.33 12241228.) claims that the utility function U(z, F1, , Fn) I have assumed in Jagannathan (Jagannathan, R. 1985. Use of sample information in stochastic recourse and chance-constrained programming models. Management Sci.31 96108.) must be linear in F1, and consequently my results pertaining to chance-constrained programming are not valid. In this note, I show through a simple counterexample that LaValle's claim is based on an erroneously stated result.

## 4. NoteBlau's Dilemma Revisited
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Nau
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
The issue of equivalence between chance-constrained programming problems (CCPP's) and Bayesian utility-maximization problems (BUMP's), and the anomalous evaluation of information in CCPP's, are re-examined in light of a recent paper by Jagannathan and the ensuing exchange between Jagannathan and LaValle. Difficulties in explaining value of information within the framework of chance-constrained programming are illustrated in a numerical example due to Jagannathan.

## 5. Portfolio Analysis with Partial Information: The Case of Grouped Data
### Author(s):
- Edwin J. Elton
- Martin J. Gruber
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
Almost all of the literature in finance analyzing the selection of optimum portfolios assumes that the agent making the decision has a full set of estimates of the expected return for each security and the variance covariance matrix between securities. In actual practice most decision makers simply receive a list of stocks with ranking on each stock and perhaps some partial risk information. The purpose of this paper is to determine what we can learn from portfolio theory about optimum decisions if all the investor knows is the grouping of stocks plus at best the average characteristics of the stocks in a group. This analysis is important because these are the data most investors utilize to make their portfolio decisions.

## 6. Pricing Policies for Quantity Discounts
### Author(s):
- Maqbool Dada
- K. N. Srikanth
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we analyze the seller's decision to offer quantity discounts to the buyer. We build on an existing model as follows. We first characterize the range of order sizes and prices which reduce costs for the buyer and seller, and develop related pricing schemes. The model is then extended to allow inventory carrying costs to be a function of price.

## 7. A Model for Relating Advertising Media Exposures to Purchase Incidence Behavior Patterns
### Author(s):
- Fred S. Zufryden
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
A stochastic model is proposed to study the effect of advertising on consumer purchase dynamics by specifically relating the distribution of exposures, from a brand's media schedule, to brand purchase incidence behavior patterns over time. The approach is based on underlying individual consumer behavior assumptions that reflect the dynamics of exposures to advertising and brand purchase behavior, conditional on the level of advertising exposure received. Moreover, a population-based model is derived by aggregating over individual consumers who may be heterogeneous with respect to exposure probability, purchase rate, and sensitivity to advertising.

## 8. An Empirical Evaluation of Alternative Forecasting Combinations
### Author(s):
- Thomas D. Russell
- Everett E. Adam, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
Combining naive forecasting models as an alternative to using any one model has shown promise for improving forecasting accuracy at reasonable additional cost. This study extends previous combination modeling by selectively including models in combination rather than using all individual models in a set, evaluating six new model combinations and comparing them to three previously investigated model combinations, investigating the impact of forecasting time horizon, and investigating alternative error measures to mean square error (MSE). Results support using a model-combination that (1) selects the best 3 to 5 models from the 10 models studied and (2) weights the selected models based upon the inverse proportion of their individual accuracy as measured by MSE.

## 9. Warnings of Malfunction: The Decision to Inspect and Maintain Production Processes on Schedule or on Demand
### Author(s):
- M. E. Pat-Cornell
- H. L. Lee
- G. Tagaras
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we study different maintenance policies for the control of production systems that are subject to deterioration over time. A Markov model is used to characterize the deterioration process. Two types of basic maintenance policies are considered: scheduled preventive maintenance and maintenance on demand. The former deals with scheduled maintenance procedures performed on the process at fixed intervals, regardless of its status. In the latter, maintenance procedures are performed in response to signals observed from the production process, and are thus a function of the condition of the process over time. For both approaches the policies can be further classified, based on the mode of observation: the process itself or the outputs of the process. Thus we can have preventive maintenance of the process, scheduled inspection of the outputs of the process, maintenance in response to signals given by the process, and maintenance in response to signals as indicated by the quality of the outputs. We analyze the performances of these four policies, and derive their long-run disutilities. Numerical examples show that, by monitoring the process with the appropriate optimal maintenance policy, significant savings can be achieved.

## 10. Setup Reduction and Increased Effective Capacity
### Author(s):
- Anne M. Spence
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
Setup reduction is an important aspect of the Just-In-Time (JIT) and Zero Inventory (ZI) concepts. This paper looks at the increased effective capacity that results from setup reduction. A certain amount of time, as well as expense, is required for each setup within a multiproduct firm. By reducing the time required for setups, less time is required to carry out those setups. That time can either be used to reduce lot sizes or to reduce overtime. We use an EOQ-like setting with stationary deterministic demand rates for each product. This simple model allows explicit solutions to be derived, not only for optimal setup time reduction, but for optimal overtime as well. Numerical examples illustrate the results.

## 11. A Multi-Echelon Inventory Model for Repairable Items with Emergency Lateral Transshipments
### Author(s):
- Hau L. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
In multi-echelon inventory systems that cover extensive geographical regions, emergency lateral transshipment between bases is commonly practiced to provide improved service support for products. In these systems, since neighboring bases are at shorter distances than to the depot, the base may seek stock from them to satisfy its demands when it is out of stock. In this paper we develop a continuous-review multi-echelon model for repairable items when emergency lateral transshipments between identical bases are allowed. Approximations are derived and tested for the expected level of backorders and the quantity of emergency lateral transshipments in cases where fairly high service levels are required. These approximations are used to determine the optimal stocking levels in such a system. A procedure to find these stocking levels is given. Numerical examples illustrate the application of the procedure and the tradeoffs involved in emergency lateral transshipment.

## 12. Modeling Coordination in Organizations and Markets
### Author(s):
- Thomas W. Malone
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simple set of coordination structures that model certain kinds of information processing involved in organizations and markets. Four generic coordination structures are defined: product hierarchies, functional hierarchies, centralized markets, and decentralized markets. Then tradeoffs among these structures are analyzed in terms of production costs, coordination costs, and vulnerability costs. This model is unusual in that it includes detailed definitions of the structures at a micro-level and mathematical derivations of comparisons among them at a macro-level. In the final section of the paper, several connections are made between these formal results and previous work on organizational design.

## 13. A Dynamic Planning Technique for Continuous Activities Under Multiple Resource Constraints
### Author(s):
- Mufit Ozden
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
The solution technique developed in this paper integrates the simplex search algorithm into the recursive calculations of dynamic programming in order to mitigate the curse-of-dimensionality. Since differentiation is not required as a means of optimization procedure, it is expected that this technique will have an important impact on planning problems, such as the multiple resource allocation problems which involve nondifferentiable and/or highly nonlinear performance functions. Applications of the technique to very complex problems seem to confirm the anticipated polynomial average performance.

## 14. Consumer Protection Laws: Violator Detection and Enforcement Strategy
### Author(s):
- Priscilla A. Labarbera
- Edward L. Melnick
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
A methodology is proposed for both the assessment and enforcement of consumer protection laws and regulations. An assessment model is presented to determine the effect of a law (e.g., violation rate, characteristics and/or profile of violators) and then a cost efficient law enforcement strategy is described that is aimed at the violator population identified by the assessment model. This methodology consists of a short enforcement campaign, directed mainly against the violators, and is then followed by an inexpensive maintenance program.

## 17. NoteThe Bierman-Hausman Credit Granting Model: A Note
### Author(s):
- Venkat Srinivasan
- Yong H. Kim
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1987
### Abstract:
To date, the Bierman-Hausman (Bierman, H., Jr., W. H. Hausman. 1970. The credit granting decision. Management Sci.16 B519B532.) model remains the most rigorous normative effort in credit granting. This note points out that the procedure suggested by Bierman and Hausman for considering the time value effect is valid only under the extremely unrealistic assumption of a firm being able to simultaneously collect its receivables and make payments to its suppliers. A simple modification is presented to incorporate more realistic cash flow timing assumptions.
