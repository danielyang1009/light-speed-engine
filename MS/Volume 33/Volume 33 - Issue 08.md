## 1. A Model for Predicting Frequencies of Random Events
### Author(s):
- Donald Rosenfield
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new technique for forecasting frequencies of events over time for individuals. The technique bases future occurrences on an estimation procedure based on historical data. The estimation procedure incorporates two types of uncertainty: population variation and individual propensity to change. An example is presented.

## 2. A Class of Utility Functions Containing all the Common Utility Functions
### Author(s):
- Patrick L. Brockett
- Linda L. Golden
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
This paper presents a class of utility functions (class A) that contains all of the utility functions commonly used for mathematical modeling: the class consisting of those utility functions whose derivatives alternate in sign. A simple representation via mixtures of exponential utilities is provided for this class which is both mathematically convenient and conducive to functional operations. A connection with Laplace transforms and the resultant implications for preference relations, aggregation and utility assessment are discussed.

## 3. Estimating Utility Functions in the Presence of Response Error
### Author(s):
- Kathryn Blackmond Laskey
- Gregory W. Fischer
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
This paper explores the nature and extent of response error when direct multiattribute utility assessment procedures are used as a basis for modeling preferences for risky multiattribute alternatives. The analysis is based on an experimental study of preferences for alternative air pollution control policies whose consequences were characterized by three value attributes: cost to consumers, level of pollution related illness, and level of pollution related mortality. The study generated the following findings: (i) direct assessments of preferences for outcomes were quite reliable and stable over a two-week time period; (ii) parameter estimates for additive utility functions fitted to direct utility assessments were both precise and stable over a two-week time period; (iii) statistically fitted additive utility models provided very accurate predictions of directly assessed preferences two weeks later (or earlier); (iv) ranking outcomes before assigning utilities to them resulted in high levels of serial correlation of errors in direct assessments; and (v) using a parameter estimation procedure that adjusted for serial correlation of errors had little effect on the accuracy of the model's predictions of preferences in a different time period.

## 4. Marketing-Production Decisions in an Industrial Channel of Distribution
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
- Richard Steinberg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model that considers the interface between marketing and production decisions in a channel of distribution of industrial goods comprised of a manufacturer and a distributor. The key issue investigated is the nature of the coordination within the channel in light of an unstable pattern of seasonal demand. The investigation, which focuses on dynamic issues, considers production activities such as product delivery and inventory policy, and their link to marketing strategies such as pricing policies.

## 5. Parallel Machine Scheduling: Processing Rates Dependent on Number of Jobs in Operation
### Author(s):

- Jan Karel Lenstra
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
We treat the class of n job  m machine scheduling problems with job processing times dependent on the number of jobs being simultaneously processed in the system at any point in time. Such systems occur when jobs are assigned to multiple parallel processors driven by a common power source. In situations typical of hydraulic and pneumatic power sources the level of power delivered to each processor is inversely proportional to the number of processors simultaneously at work. Aside from the variable processing rate assumptions, the remaining assumptions on the structure of the system conform to those of the standard identical parallel processor problem without job preemption. Although the standard n job  m machine problem is NP-hard with respect to a makespan measure, this is not the case when our seemingly complicating variable processing rate function, typical of hydraulic power sources, is included.

## 6. An Optimal Design Problem for Limited Processor Sharing Systems
### Author(s):
- Genji Yamazaki
- Hirotaka Sakasegawa
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
An optimal design problem is considered for processor-sharing service systems, where the number of customers served simultaneously is limited to a fixed finite number (called multiplicity). The decision variable is the multiplicity and the optimal criterion is to minimize the mean number of customers in the system, or, alternatively, to minimize the mean sojourn time for a customer. It is proved that the processor-sharing discipline with any multiplicity ameliorates the system performance if a service-requirement distribution is an NWU (new worse than used) type and deteriorates the performance if the distribution type is Erlangian. Moreover, it is conjectured through numerical results that the limited processor-sharing system will ameliorate (deteriorate) the performance if the coefficient of variation of the service-requirement distribution is larger (smaller) than 1.

## 7. A Layout Planning System with Multiple Criteria and a Variable Domain Representation
### Author(s):
- F. Robert Jacobs
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
This paper describes a new system capable of solving detailed facility layout problems. The system allows the consideration of multiple objectives on the layout solution. Criteria related to weighted distance between interacting layout elements, the structure of the final layout design, the use of circulation space in the layout and the satisfaction of special adjacency requirements, are included in the formulation. The paper includes a comparison of this new procedure to existing procedures using problems selected from the literature.

## 8. Priority Rules for Job Shops with Weighted Tardiness Costs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
Mainstream research in priority dispatching has considered jobs with equal delay penalties, thereby ruling out strategic differentiation of customer orders. We develop and test efficient dispatching rules for the weighted tardiness problem with job-specific due dates and delay penalties. Our approach builds on previous greedy heuristics which assign the priority on the basis of the expected tardiness cost per immediate processing requirements. In multi-machine applications, estimates of the remaining leadtime are needed to determine local operation due dates and to evaluate the adequacy of the job's slack. Two slightly different look-ahead features are identified, and the corresponding priority rules are tested in job shop experiments with a variety of load conditions. The results indicate that the new rules are not only superior to competing rules for minimizing weighted tardiness penalties but are also robust for several other criteria, such as the number of tardy jobs and the costs of in-process inventories.

## 9. Asymmetric Players and Bargaining for Profit Shares in Natural Resource Development
### Author(s):
- G. Anandalingam
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we study how natural resource development contracts depend on the level of bargaining power of Trans National Corporations (Agents) and host country governments (Principal). We concentrate on share contracts where a portion of the net firm income from resource development is transferred to the government, and show that (i) as the number of agents increase, the principal receives a greater share; (ii) if either player is able to threaten the other, the threatening player receives a greater share; and (iii) if the principal shares in production costs, he obtains a greater share. These results would generally be invariant if the principal was less risk averse than the agent.

## 10. Does Cheaper, Faster, or Better Imply Sooner in the Timing of Innovation Decisions?
### Author(s):
- Steven A. Lippman
- Kevin F. McCardle
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1987
### Abstract:
A common myth/conception, based upon the notion of increasing returns to scale in R&D activity, is that large firms account for a disproportionate share of innovations. In this paper we consider three types of informational returns to scale (cheaper, faster, and better) and examine the impact of each on the timing of the firm's innovation decision. Contrary to popular conception, the decision is made later when information is cheaper, and the change in timing is unsignable in the case of faster arrival of information. Only more accurate (better) information leads to earlier decisions.
