## 1. Planning System Success: A Conceptualization and an Operational Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
Research on strategic planning has been handicapped by lack of an appropriate operationalizing scheme for measuring the success of planning systems. In this paper, an operational model for measuring planning system success is developed in terms of two interrelated dimensionsimprovements in the capabilities of the planning system and extent of fulfillment of key planning objectives. Multiple items reflecting these dimensions are proposed. Construct validity of the two dimensions are evaluated by applying Jreskog's analysis of covariance structures approach on data on the planning practices of 202 strategic planning units. Validated measurement schemes for the two model dimensions are offered for use in future research efforts on strategic planning effectiveness.

## 2. Entry and Learning
### Author(s):
- Timothy M. Devinney
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
This paper shows the difficulties associated with discerning the impact of learning and pressures of competitive entry on the price and cost of production in commodity markets. It shows that the patterns of price and cost movements over time will be dramatically affected by the entry of new competitors. If firms possess U-shaped average cost curves, entry alone can generate price and cost declines which look like learning induced reductions. Alternatively, cost increases may occur even when learning is quite strong.

## 3. Consensus Forecasts of Corporate Earnings: Analysts' Forecasts and Time Series Methods
### Author(s):

- Robert Harris
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
An alternative to using a single forecasting method is to average the forecasts made by various methods. In this paper we examine empirically combinations of financial analysts' forecasts and forecasts from time series methods in order to predict corporate earnings per share. We conclude that, on average, the primary forecasting advantages of analysts over time series methods based on annual data appear to occur over short forecast horizons (less than a year). Neither analysts nor other time series methods substantially outperform a random walk prediction of no change when forecasts are made near the beginning of the fiscal year. For predictions in the first half of the fiscal year, there is evidence of forecasting benefits from combining time series and analysts' forecasts, especially if there are few analysts' forecasts.

## 4. A Predictive Method of Teacher's Structure in China's University (19852000)
### Author(s):

- Pen Guozhong
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper, a predictive model is designed to provide the Educational Department of China with the information necessary to draw up the program (19852000) for education development. This model contains two submodels, that is, the predictive model to the annual teacher's number of each title and the fuzzy predictive model to the annual teacher's number of each age. The first submodel is a Markov Chain model and the second submodel is a fuzzy predictive model. Before establishing the second submodel, the fuzzy set of judging indices for the promotion of teachers and the reasonable age's regions for the promotion of teachers for each title were stated and the fuzzy membership functions for every judging index were established by using the fuzzy statistical method. In this paper, a method is presented for establishing models. The predictive models are widely useful. Not only can the models be used in the educational departments, but they can also be used for making promotion policy in other administrative departments.

## 5. The Optimality of (s, S) Policies for a Stochastic Inventory Problem with Proportional and Lump-Sum Penalty Cost
### Author(s):
- Yash Aneja
- A. Hamid Noori
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a single product multi-period inventory problem for which the penalty cost consists of two parts, a lump-sum portion which is independent of the size of the shortage and a portion which is linear in the size of the shortage. We show that for all nonincreasing demand density functions, the expected total cost function is K-convex and hence, there is an optimal policy for the n-period problem that is (s, S).

## 6. Inventory Policies Under Various Optimizing Criteria and Variable Markup Rates
### Author(s):
- F. J. Arcelus
- G. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
This paper extends the deterministic EOQ model to reflect various optimizing criteria and alternative demand and price structures. Its primary purpose is to develop decision rules for the management of finished goods inventories, especially in retailing, where inventories are evaluated in the same way as any other investment, namely on their ability to generate profits, rather than on the traditional least-cost basis. To that effect, the models developed here consider demand to be a function of price, with price defined as a markup of unit cost. The decision variables are the order quantity and the markup rate. Possible optimizing objectives include profits, return on investment, or residual income, the three most widely used evaluators of short-term investment performance. Optimal solutions for each case are obtained and the resulting inventory policies evaluated.

## 7. On Optimal Reservation Prices in Auctions
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
The theory of auction design examines how various factors affect the outcome of an auction. Most of the existing literature focuses on how varying the amount of information available to each bidder affects the bid-taker's expected revenue when all other factors remain constant. This paper studies how the bid-taker's expected revenue varies with changes in the auction format when such changes affect the number of bidders, and, in turn, the bidders' maximum value for the object being sold. Specifically, we examine how varying the reservation price or screening level affects the bid-taker's expected revenue though its effect on the number of bidders. For two simple examples, the losses associated with a reduced number of bidders outweighs any benefits that nontrivial reservation prices might have had in models with an exogonously set number of bidders.

## 8. A Mathematical Model of Dental Caries Used to Evaluate the Benefits of Alternative Frequencies of Bitewing Radiographs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
This paper describes the development of a mathematical model that can provide the basis for a decision support system to aid dentists (or patients) in making decisions about how often to perform (or receive) bitewing radiographs. The model, which describes the initiation and progression of approximal dental caries, is developed from an analysis of 4 to 13 sets of serial bitewing radiograph exams taken on over 700 individuals. Caries incidence is modeled as follows: (1) there is an underlying gamma distribution representing variation in an individual's expected annual number of new lesions; (2) an individual's distribution of new lesions in a year follows a Poisson process with expected value that can be thought of as having been randomly selected from the gamma distribution. Progression is modeled by assuming duration of carious lesions in each half of the dental enamel can be approximated by a piecewise exponential distribution. Using this model, we determine the relationship between when the next set of bitewing radiographs is performed and the probability carious lesions are detected before any lesions reach the inner half of the dentin. For high risk individuals with no unrestored enamel lesions from their last set of radiographs, bitewings should be scheduled yearly; for low risk individuals with no unrestored enamel lesions, bitewings could be scheduled every 2.5 to 3 years, though both of these conclusions depend on the patient's and/or dentist's attitude toward risk.

## 9. Batching to Minimize Flow Times on One Machine
### Author(s):
- Gregory Dobson
- Uday S. Karmarkar
- Jeffrey L. Rummel
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
Machine sequencing formulations typically assume that the characteristics of the job set to be processed are given. However, in many applications, jobs can be batched in different ways. Two types of minimum flow-time sequencing problems with lot sizing are formulated. The item-flow formulation is solved giving an index rule for ordering items. The batch-flow formulation is solved for the single product case showing that processing is done in unequal batches ordered in decreasing size. Heuristics and bounds are provided for the multiproduct case.

## 10. A Constrained Capital Budgeting Problem with Applications to Repair Kit Selection
### Author(s):
- John W. Mamer
- Andrew W. Shogan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
We consider a capital budgeting problem in which each potential project requires the performance of a known set of activities. In general, these sets of activities are not mutually exclusive. However, when a particular activity is common to the requirements of multiple projects, a single performance of the activity simultaneously satisfies the requirements of the multiple projects. Associated with the performance of each activity are two quantities: a known fixed cost and a consumption of a known amount of a scarce resource. Because the sets of activities required by the projects are not mutually exclusive, we cannot apportion an activity's fixed cost or resource consumption to a single project. In this paper, we formulate this capital budgeting problem (and a slight variant) as a maximal network flow problem with a side constraint, and we report computational experience using Lagrangian relaxation to find an optimal solution. We also discuss an application to the selection of parts and tools to include in a field repair kit used to fix a variety of types of breakdowns.

## 11. NoteDoes Rolling Back Decision Trees Really Require the Independence Axiom?
### Author(s):
- Gordon B. Hazen
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1987
### Abstract:
In a recent article, LaValle and Wapman argue that the recursion analysis of decision trees in extensive form requires the Herstein-Milnor independence axiom. I claim that most extensive form analyses are perfectly proper in the absence of independence, but that the transformation from extensive to normal form is impermissible.
