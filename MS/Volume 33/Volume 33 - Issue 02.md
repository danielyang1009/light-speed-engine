## 1. Cognitive Process as a Basis for MIS and DSS Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
Cognitive process research can provide specific, operational guidelines for MIS/DSS design by delineating the specific influences on managers' cognitive processes in sensing, formulating, and solving problems. The paper integrates some of the considerable body of literature on these processes in the framework of Piaget's model to illustrate the type of guidelines cognitive process research can provide. It also delineates three topical areas for future research: (a) Choice of Logico-Mathematical-Structures (LMSs), (b) Development of LMSs, and (c) Application/Attribution of LMSs to sense, formulate and solve problems, and describes how research in these areas can help improve the effectiveness of MIS/DSS.

## 2. A Semi-Markov Model for Primary Health Care Manpower Supply Prediction
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a semi-Markov formulation for modelling transitions of physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants between different settings and locations within a geographic area. The model predicts the supply of primary care providers over a planning horizon. We then compare the model predictions with estimates of future demand and need for primary care for a community. Statistical tests for validation and sensitivity analysis of the model are also performed to establish the appropriateness of the semi-Markov approach. With the likelihood of an oversupply of physicians during this decade, the model offers a useful tool for health planners, administrators, legislators, and regulators, for objective decision making.

## 3. Uncertainty, Competition, and the Adoption of New Technology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
Faced with the decision of whether or not to adopt a new technology whose economic value cannot be gauged with certainty, the manager of the firm may elect to decrease the uncertainty by sequentially gathering information (at a unit cost of c > 0), updating his prior beliefs in a Bayesian manner. Uncertainty regarding the actions of a competitor, however, cannot be reduced. Our model allows a manager to account for potential competition, either substitute or complementary, by inclusion of strategic considerations modelled in a game theoretic setting. We show that the firm's best response mapping satisfies a dynamic programming recursion (even when the one period reward function is unbounded) providing management with a familiar tool to solve its problem. Best response behavior is characterized by a monotone sequence of pairs of threshold numbers which give rise to a cone-shaped continuation region. The continuation region is shown to shift up (down) with increases in the expected level of substitute (complementary) competition making the firm less (more) likely to adopt the innovation. Finally, the existence of a Nash equilibrium in cone-shaped strategies is established.

## 4. The Effect of Business Interdependencies on Product R&D-Intensive Business Performance
### Author(s):
- Mel Horwitch
- Raymond A. Thietart
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
One of the major decisions that firms face regarding R&D-intensive businesses is a structural one: establishing the appropriate level of internal strategic interdependency within and among business units. The current discussion over the effectiveness of creating small, independent, and entrepreneurial venture units in multi-business corporations is part of this larger structural concern.

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
A proxy attribute is an indirect measure of an ultimate decision objective. Keeney and Raiffa (Keeney, R. L., H. Raiffa. 1976. Decisions with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value Tradeoffs. John Wiley, New York.) argued that assessing utility functions over proxy attributes requires complex inferences that may exceed the human capacity for consistent judgment, thus biasing utility assessments. This hypothesis was tested in an experimental study of preferences for pollution control alternatives. Each decision maker made two sets of utility assessments: the first regarding outcomes described by the fundamental attributes pollution control cost and pollution related illness; the second regarding outcomes described by the fundamental attribute pollution control cost and the proxy attribute pollution emissions level (which served as an indirect measure of illness). The subjects displayed a near universal bias to overweight the proxy attribute relative to the prescriptions of expected utility theory. The bias was large, resulting in a substantial loss of expected utility in a simulated policy decision making scenario. To account for this bias, we developed three heuristic models of preferences for proxy attributes: the best guess, worst case, and relative importance models. The results strongly favored the relative importance model, according to which decision makers assess scaling constants by relying on general attitudes regarding the relative importance of different decision objectives rather than on well-articulated preferences for rates of substitution between pairs of attributes.

## 6. Analysis of a Two-Echelon Inventory Control System with Complete Redistribution
### Author(s):
- H. Jnsson
- E. A. Silver
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
This paper examines a two-level distribution system consisting of a central warehouse (CW) supplying several branch warehouses (BW's), which, in turn, supply normally-distributed customer demands in a periodic-review environment. The CW replenishes system inventory using a base-stock replenishment policy and a predetermined order cycle of H time periods; i.e., every H periods, the CW orders enough from an outside supplier to bring the systemwide inventory position to a certain level (to be determined) based on a given minimum level of customer service. Upon receipt of this order, the CW allocates it entirely to the BW's so as to minimize the expected total units short at the BW's. This simple allocation scheme, may, of course, lead to out-of-balance BW inventories towards the end of the CW's order cycle. Hence, redistribution during the cycle should be considered. The redistribution treated here is a complete redistribution of all BW inventories one period before the end of the order cycle. Approximate formulas are derived which allow for a comparison of the system-wide inventories appropriate to each of two allocation schemes: (1) the simple allocation scheme only; and (2) the simple allocation scheme with total redistribution one period before the end of the order cycle. Limited computational tests indicate the magnitude of the improvements possible with total redistribution, and the sensitivities of these improvements to model parameters.

## 7. The Structure of Equilibria in Market Share Attraction Models
### Author(s):
- George E. Monahan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
A market share attraction model of competitive effort allocation by two firms is formulated as a constant sum, two-person game. The dependence of optimal competitive effort allocations on factors such as gross profit margins, relative effectiveness of effort, and attraction elasticity of effort is studied. Two versions of the model are developed. In the first version, effort budgets of both competitors are exogenously fixed. In the second, the competitors each choose both budget levels and allocations. In each version of the model, an important function of the parameters, called the competitive advantage ratio, indicates when it is optimal to either increase or decrease effort allocated in a market in response to changes in various measures of effectiveness. Implications of differences in the cost associated with each competitor's budget on equilibrium allocations are derived.

## 8. Institutionalization of a Management Science Innovation in Police Departments
### Author(s):
- Michael W. Lawless
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
The adoption of management science models has typically been studied in time frames of less than two years. Recommendations of government decisionmakers for improving the likelihood of successful model development, diffusion, and adoption have been based on these studies. Yet some factors important to the use of models do not emerge in the short term. This study examines model use over a longer time frame, and draws some policy implications. A survey was taken of 17 police departments live years after they implemented PCAM, the Patrol Car Allocation Model. Utilization (extent of use) and institutionalization (extent of organizational adaptation) were evaluated. Overall, there were few signs that use of PCAM had a major impact on the state of police patrol allocation. PCAM was found to be operational in six departments, and fully institutionalized in two. Based on patterns of use and nonuse, recommendations are made to enhance the long-term impact of future modeling projects. Among them are to survey user needs and give them a larger role in model development, to design models capable of an expanded range of tasks and of running on personal computers, and to include performance evaluation and feedback in all model-building projects. A structured approach to development is suggested to anticipate implementation and institutionalization problems, and to produce integrated solutions.

## 9. Application of Game Theoretic Analysis to a Problem in Demography
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Owen
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
Governments in certain countries have tried over the last two decades to draw most industry to the largest cities. The effect has generally been a large increase in both the population and land area of the cities, as the nearby rural areas are taken out of agricultural production and urbanized. Where the land is especially fertile, this can represent a definite loss to the country's agricultural capabilities.

## 10. Strategy, Strategy Making, and PerformanceAn Empirical Investigation
### Author(s):
- Eli Segev
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the relationships between strategic type and strategy-making mode on organizational performance. Two important typologies were used in this study, one stressing strategic type, the other, strategy-making mode. Hypotheses were stated on strategy fit of specific strategy type with strategy-making modes, where strategic fit contributes to organizational performance. As part of a larger study of strategy formulation, the two top executives in each of 126 kibbutz-owned industrial enterprises evaluated their organization's strategic type as Defender. Prospector, Analyzer, or Reactor, and its strategy-making mode as Entrepreneurial, Adaptive and Planning. The executives typed their organizations using textual descriptions of strategies. The findings clearly indicate links between the two typologies, i.e., associations between strategic types and strategy-making modes, and that certain combinations are more conducive to enhancing organizational performance than others. When nonoptimal stragies are adopted they result in lower levels of performance. The paper also relates the primary discussion on the relationship between the strategy type and strategy-making mode typologies to the content-process dilemma on which it sheds some light.

## 11. Simulating the Response of a Small Open Politico-Economic System to International Crises: The Case of Switzerland
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
This paper applies some traditional management science tools to the study of Switzerlanda small country characterized by the openness of its politico-economic system to the outside world. Despite its apparent vulnerability to external influences, Switzerland has been able to maintain a remarkable degree of stability throughout the political and economic difficulties of the 1970s and 1980s. In order to help understand the main elements of this ability to absorb major international fluctuations as well as provide decision-makers with ways to analyze them and to investigate the impact of other possible developments, a simulation model of Switzerland has been constructed. This model (SIMSWISS) is based on a representation of the most important sectors of the Swiss politico-economic system, with special emphasis on their connections to the outside. SIMSWISS is constructed via a combination of dynamic simulation and optimization techniques which allow its user to check its accuracy as a representation of reality and to engage in the analysis of possible scenarios and alternative policies. An energy crisis scenario is used to illustrate how the model works and how it can be used to understand the functioning of the Swiss politico-economic system. We hope that this model will serve as the basis for a broader use of management science techniques in the study of other politico-economic systems.

## 12. NoteA Re-Examination of the Results of Hogarth and Makridakis' The Value of Decision Making in a Complex Environment: An Experimental Approach
### Author(s):
- William T. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1987
### Abstract:
This note raises questions about two of the results of Hogarth and Makridakis (Hogarth, R. M., S. Makridakis. 1981. The value of decision making in a complex environment: An experimental approach. Management Sci.27 93107.) based on a lack of statistical support and inadequate consideration of the effect of team starting position on performance. Using bootstrapping simulation and regression analyses which specifically consider team starting position, we find (1) support for Hogarth and Makridakis' finding that a consistent strategy outperforms a random one, and (2) statistical disconfirmation for their second finding, that consistently managed arbitrary teams perform quite well in comparison with human management teams.
