## 1. The Efficiency of the Simplex Method: A Survey
### Author(s):
- Ron Shamir
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
The Linear Programming Problem is by far the most widely used optimization model. Its impact on economic and government modeling is immense. The Simplex Method for solving the Linear Programming (LP) Problem, due to George Dantzig, has been an extremely efficient computational tool for almost four decades. The method has been the subject of intense investigations for many years, but some major aspects of its behavior are not fully understood yet.

## 2. Scheduling Ocean Transportation of Crude Oil

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
A crude oil tanker scheduling problem faced by a major oil company is presented and solved using an elastic set partitioning model. The model takes into account all fleet cost components, including the opportunity cost of ship time, port and canal charges, and demurrage and bunker fuel. The model determines optimal speeds for the ships and the best routing of ballast (empty) legs, as well as which cargos to load on controlled ships and which to spot charter. All feasible schedules are generated, the cost of each is accurately determined and the best set of schedules is selected. For the problems encountered, optimal integer solutions to set partitioning problems with thousands of binary variables have been achieved in less than a minute.

## 3. On the Evaluation of Compound Options
### Author(s):

- Stewart D. Hodges
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
Compound option valuation formulae give rise to the summation of a series of multinormal distribution functions. This paper presents an identity on sums of nested multinormal distributions of arbitrary dimension. We show that this identity generalizes some well-known low order identities for the multinormal distribution. We present three applications of the new identity to contingent claims valuation problems. The first and second applications show that by reducing significantly the number of integrals to be evaluated, faster and more accurate algorithms can be developed for implementing the Geske-Johnson American put valuation formula and the Roll-Geske-Whaley American call formula; the third gives new economic insights into the valuation of disaggregated coupon bonds.

## 4. Combination of Forecasts: An Extension
### Author(s):
- Sunil Gupta
- Peter C. Wilton
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
Existing approaches to combining multiple forecasts generally offer either theoretical richness or empirical robustness, but not both together. In this paper, we propose a new method for combining forecasts which attempts to overcome this imbalance. The method allows easy inclusion of relevant subjective and empirical information about the forecasts, while providing weights which are: (i) intuitively meaningful, and (ii) not dependent upon large numbers of observations of prior forecast accuracy. Results of a simulation experiment show the method to be highly robust, and significantly superior to existing approaches under many conditions.

## 5. Combining Overlapping Information
### Author(s):
- Robert T. Clemen
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
A decision maker trying to learn about an uncertain quantity may obtain divergent information from a number of sources (e.g., experts). In this paper we study the decision maker's problem of aggregating this information to form his posterior distribution when he believes that the experts' opinions are dependent due to shared information. Examples in both normal and Bernoulli frameworks lead to some surprising general insights regarding the impact of the dependence on the posterior distribution. The study has implications for practitioners who face real-world information-aggregation problems and for groups of experts who seek a consensus.

## 6. The Financing Threshold Effect on Success and Failure of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Start-Ups
### Author(s):
- Edward B. Roberts
- Oscar Hauptman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
The theories of technological innovation are examined in the context of the formation and growth of biomedical and pharmaceutical firms. Analyses are based on detailed data gathered from 26 firms, founded between 1968 and 1975 in Massachusetts, supplemented by a three-member expert panel evaluation of the risk associated with use of each firm's products.

## 7. Analyzing Tenant Assignment Policies
### Author(s):
- Edward H. Kaplan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
This paper discusses two popular policies used by housing authorities to assign applicants to housing projects: first available unit and priority assignment policies. The policies are compared according to their abilities to integrate housing projects, applicant assignment probabilities, and mean waiting times. Our results show that priority policies can successfully integrate public housing projects while first available unit policies can exacerbate segregation. These results support the reported empirical performance of these policies. We briefly consider the time necessary to reach steady state for these policies; this is one point of departure for further research.

## 8. Lot Sizes, Lead Times and In-Process Inventories
### Author(s):
- Uday S. Karmarkar
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
In many manufacturing problems, the total lead time taken to manufacture a product is an important consideration. Long lead times impose costs due to higher work-in-process inventory, increased uncertainty about requirements, larger safety stocks and poorer performance to due dates. Traditional lot sizing models ignore lead time related costs, although there are systematic relationships between lot sizes and lead times. This paper examines these relationships and their implications for lot sizing and work-in-process inventories, for batch manufacturing shops with queues.

## 9. NoteLot-Sizing and Sequencing Delays
### Author(s):
- Uday S. Karmarkar
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1987
### Abstract:
In production scheduling, time performance is usually taken to be the province of sequencing models which take task processing times to be given. However, in practice, processing times can often be controlled by the choice of lot sizes which thus have a major impact on makespan, waiting times, flow times and other measures. Here the interface between lot sizing and sequencing is introduced and the effect of lot sizes on makespan and flow times is qualitatively analyzed.
