## 1. Universal Education for the Management Sciences
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
As we move toward more complex ways of controlling production and distribution of a greater variety of goods and services through ever more complicated technology, it is perhaps natural that some should entertain the illusion that automation will ultimately take the place of human effort in supplying our needs. We hear daily that this or that management group will soon be replaced by the computer.

## 2. Industrial Dynamics and the Design of Management Control Systems
### Author(s):
- Edward B. Roberts
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
The usual approaches to management control system design often fail to be effective, sometimes creating problems more significant that those they resolve. Such failures result from lack of total system understanding, from use of subsystem constraints, and from inadequate or improper treatment of the human decision-making elements of the system. Examples drawn from Industrial Dynamics research studies illustrate these problems and provide some pointers for remedying the difficulties.

## 3. Reducing Fixed and Variable Costs of Distribution
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Hammond
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
This article describes a problem in which most of the warehouses in a distribution system were owned by the Company and a significant reduction in the number of warehouses was being considered. A model of the distribution system was used to determine, through a series of approximations, a system in which total costs—including the fixed costs—were minimized by eliminating the most costly warehouses and changing the locations and sizes of others. The development of the model and the interpretation of the results in terms of management action are discussed.

## 4. An Application of the Critical Path Method to Job Shop Scheduling—A Case Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
Small and medium-sized job shops are often run with little or no production scheduling. As the number and complexity of jobs increases, management finds it increasingly difficult to control costs and still maintain delivery dates. In order to provide management with the needed control, some practical scheduling system is needed. This case study describes the installation, in a medium-sized tool shop, of such a system based on CPM and operated manually. Emphasis is placed on the problems of converting CPM into a continuing, working system under the manual operation of shop scheduling personnel. Much of the value of CPM in the final system is its use as a “one-shot” analytical tool to aid in the production of a shop schedule. An unusual feature of the system is that it provides a method for the routine scheduling of two critical manpower resources in a multiple-network situation.

## 5. A Management Control Systems Simulation Model
### Author(s):
- John Kagdis
- Michael R. Lackner
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
This paper describes a digital simulation model of a hypothetical business system and discusses problems pertinent to the construction and use of the model. Constructed in the course of a management control systems research project, the model exemplifies many problems of control and management of a large system, emphasizing information flow, its control, and its use in decision procedures. The model's modular nature permits a variety of experimental uses.

## 6. Simulation as an Aid to Staffing a Customer Service Function
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Hespos
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of simulation to solve a variation of the repairman problem too complex to be handled by analytical means. It describes the operation of a model simulating a service activity and the use of the model to provide data for management decisions.

## 7. GREMEX—A Research and Development Management Simulation Exercise
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1963
### Abstract:
In planning and managing one of today's scientific development programs, the project manager must chart a course of action from seemingly innumerable alternatives. In addition to the quantity of decisions, his planning and management tasks are usually further complicated by a required compression of the time schedule for the project and by the knowledge that Performance, Cost and Time estimates, from which he must base his decisions, are biased and have an unknown amount of uncertainty built into them.
