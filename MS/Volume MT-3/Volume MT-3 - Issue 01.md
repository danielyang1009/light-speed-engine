## 1. The Development of a Factory Simulation System Using Actual Operating Data
### Author(s):
- Earl LeGrande
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
A Simulation Process was developed at the El Segundo Division of Hughes Aircraft company whereby actual shop operating data contained in an existing data processing system is used as input to an IBM 7090 computer for simulation of the El Segundo Fabrication Shop. The Simulation Process was used as a study tool to evaluate the effects of various management decisions on the operation of the Fabrication Shop.

## 2. Even-Flow, A Scheduling Method for Reducing Lateness in Job Shops
### Author(s):
- Sanford S. Ackerman
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
The development of the Even-Flow system was initiated by Mr. Gregory M. Boni, who observed that the elapsed time to complete a job in job shops was often a function of the number of operations performed rather than the time spent actually performing the operations, and that the time between operations was relatively constant. When this is true, the job shop can be thought of as an assembly line in which the machines are the stations, and the work to be done at each station consists of all of the operations which must be performed if the jobs are to flow evenly from machine to machine through the shop.

## 3. Toward a Universally Viable Philosophy of Management
### Author(s):
- Richard F. Ericson
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
Management, itself, has come to accept, to an increasing extent, a new definition of its functions. Perhaps, in this evolution is to be found the hope of the future, based upon managerial acceptance of new concepts, new interpretations, and rejection of some old concepts—economic, political, sociological, and ethical. (Epigraph by George Fillipetti, Industrial Management in Transition, p. 328.)

## 4. An Evaluation of a Decision Simulation as a Learning Environment
### Author(s):
- James L. McKenney
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
This paper presents the conclusions of a series of experiments to evaluate the use of a decision simulation game in a graduate business school curriculum. A brief description of the simulation model is followed by a discussion of how the game was first utilized. The first formal evaluation experiment and conclusions are then presented. The second and third decision simulation game sessions are then described to illustrate the evolution of curriculum design which includes a simulation decision game. The next section deals with the experiments planned to evaluate these game sessions. The final part presents the overall conclusions and describes the decision simulation game to be utilized in 1963.

## 5. The Combination of Alternative Research Techniques in Logistics Systems Analysis
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
- Wilbur A. Steger
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
A multiplicity of techniques must be used in systems analysis in order to answer the variety of questions that arise in research on management systems. A research organization devoted to solving management science problems will inevitably use mixtures of these techniques.

## 6. The Contribution of Systems Research to Long-Range Planning in the Defense Industry
### Author(s):
- Harold Tombach
### Published:
- 1 May 1963
### Abstract:
Industrial long-range planning requires forecasts of market requirements, business environments and corporate (or divisional) capabilities. This article concerns itself with the problem of forecasting weapon markets. The needs for such forecasts are discussed and it is shown that mere reliance on official military plans, programs, statements, and “requirements” is a poor guide for long-range planning in the defense industry. It is further shown how system research studies can improve the forecasts sought. The proper conduct of such long-range-planning-oriented studies is outlined in some detail.
