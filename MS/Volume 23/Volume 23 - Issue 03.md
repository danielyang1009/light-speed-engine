## 1. Snow and Ice Removal in an Urban Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
Although important answers regarding the efficient removal of snow and ice reside in the domain of good planning and the behavioral sciences, the primary thesis of this paper is that cities can significantly improve their snow and ice removal operations by improving the routing of salt spreader trucks. A dynamic routing heuristic totally different from the static routing in general use was developed. The value of this heuristic was demonstrated to the satisfaction of city officials using a discrete simulation model of a large midwestern city. In addition, the simulator was used to answer questions of salt pile location and equipment configuration and location. Although applied to only one city, this routing heuristic, together with the simulation approach, is of potential value to all city governments that experience snow and ice emergencies.

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
A four-equation working version system based on elements of a buyer behavior model was used to organize an analysis of a five-wave consumer panel tracking the introduction of a new brand of subcompact automobile. Parameters of endogenous model variables are remarkably stable over time, alternative brands, parameter estimation methods and specially-defined subgroups of the panel, while parameters of exogenous model variables vary systematically. The model behaves reasonably in a systems sense when tested with extreme values of endogenous and exogenous variables.

## 3. A Dynamic Equilibrium Model for University Budget Planning
### Author(s):
- William F. Massy
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
A difference equation model of a university budget system is proposed and analyzed. The conditions for first and second-order dynamic equilibrium are determined, and it is shown that first-order equilibrium provides a useful criterion for financial health. Two sets of first-order solutions are examined: (1) those involving total expenditures, operating income, and the endowment payout rate; and (2) those involving tradeoffs between the net budget increase factor and tuition. The endowment payout rate emerges as a key policy variable that should be set on the basis of budget variables and total return on the endowment, rather than as the result of endowment yield. A region of instability in the solution space is defined; this region should be avoided. Stationary equilibrium, in which the fraction of the budget supported by endowment remains constant over time, simplifies the model and has other desirable properties.

## 4. Optimal Wage Rates and Force Composition in Military Manpower Planning
### Author(s):
- D. L. Jaquette
- G. R. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
A mathematical model of a military manpower system is presented which seeks to determine the optimal steady state wage rate and force distribution by length of service. Accessions and retention are the transition parameters of a steady state manpower model and these are assumed to be a function of wages. A productivity function is introduced to measure effectiveness of each force structure. Gradient search is used to find the compensation plan that will produce a long-run force with maximum effectiveness within a given limited annual budget.

## 5. Optimal Location of Plants
### Author(s):
- Alain Alcouffe
- Gilles Muratet
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of a firm that searches the optimal location of plants under the following conditions: (1) Transport costs for delivery are incurred by the firm; transport costs between a plant and a customer are linear. (2) The customers' demands are known and have to be met; customers are scattered. (3) The possible plant locations are known. (4) The production cost, at each possible plant, may be divided into two parts: (a) a fixed charge supported only if there is some production; (b) a linear unit cost. The rigorous treatment of the problem involves the production and transport costs' being minimized for each combination of plant locations. This paper presents an algorithm using the special features of the problem that reduces the number of combinations of plant locations to study. A heuristic method based on market simulation is also shown to work pretty well.

## 6. Proximal Decision Analysis with Imperfect Information
### Author(s):
- Carson E. Agnew
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
In proximal decision analysis the value of a decision depends on a vector of state variables s and a vector of decision variables d in a quadratic fashion. Suppose some data, represented by a vector x, can be obtained. This paper describes a technique for using the data and develops an expression for the value of the information conveyed by the data. Because the value model is quadratic the data processing procedure uses a linear minimum-variance estimate of the conditional mean of s which depends only on the prior moments of the state vector and the noise associated with the measurement.

## 7. A Comparison of the Bad as Old and Superimposed Renewal Models
### Author(s):
- Saul Blumenthal
- A. Greenwood
- L. H. Herbach
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
For the bad as old (BAO) model for system reliability, asymptotic distributions for time between failures and time of rth failure are obtained. For series systems, inequalities are obtained for the BAO and superimposed renewal (SR) models for distributions of number of failures and time between failures. Approximations for the distribution of number of failures are obtained for the BAO model for new, large series systems. Consideration is given to the use of BAO probabilities as approximations to SR probabilities for series systems.

## 8. Solution of a Multi-Product Manufacturing and Distribution Problem
### Author(s):
- Michael Folie
- John Tiffin
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
An actual multi-product production and distribution problem is described and an optimizing algorithm is developed. The problem, which is an example of a multi-commodity capacitated trans-shipment problem, is solved by the technique suggested by Ford and Fulkerson [Ford, L. R., D. R. Fulkerson. 1958. A suggested computation for maximal multi-commodity network flows. Management Sci.3 (1) 97101.]. Due to the size of the problem and computational constraints, the usefulness of this technique is improved by incorporating the Generalized Upper Bound algorithm of Dantzig and Van Slyke [Dantzig, G. B., R. M. Van Slyke. 1967. Generalized upper bounding technique. J. Comput. System Sci.1 213226.]. The modified technique requires manipulation of a relatively small matrix whose order is N by N where N is the number of capacitated links in the network. The traditional node-arc formulation solved by linear programming, the original arc-chain technique and the modified arc-chain algorithm are each compared in terms of computer storage requirements and solution times, resulting in considerable time efficiencies, of the order of fifty to one, for the modified Ford-Fulkerson method.

## 9. A Homogeneous Distribution Problem with Applications to Finance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of determining the cumulative distribution function and/or moments of the optimal solution value of a nonlinear program dependent upon a single random variable. This problem is difficult computationally because one must in effect determine the optimal solution to an infinite number of nonlinear programs. Bereanu [Bereanu, B., G. Peeters. 1970. A Wait-and-See problem in stochastic linear programming. An experimental computer code. Cashiers Centre Etudes Rech. Oper.12 (3) 133148.] has provided an algorithm to solve the distribution problem in the linear case based on extensions of the methods of parametric linear programming. (See also [Bereanu, B. 1967. On stochastic linear programming, distribution problems: stochastic technology matrix. Z. f. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie u. oerw. Gerbieter8 148152; Bereanu, B. 1971. The distribution problem in stochastic linear programming: the Cartesian integration method. Center of Mathematical Statistics of the Academy of RSR, Bucharest, 71103 (mimeographed); Bereanu, B. 1970. Renewal processes and some stochastic programming problems in economics. SIAM J. Appl. Math.19 308322; Bereanu, B. 1973. The Cartesian integration method in stochastic linear programming. L. Collatz, W. Wetterlink, eds. Numerische Methoden bei Optimierungsaufgaben. Springer-Verlag Publishing Co., Inc., Basel; Prekopa, A. 1966. On the probability distribution of the optimum of a random linear program. SIAM J. Control4 211222.] for the analysis of more general linear programs.) This paper presents an extremely simple algorithm to solve the problem in the special case when all functions in the nonlinear program are homogeneous. In this instance the infinite class of optimal solutions are known linear homogeneous transformations of the optimal solution to a single nonlinear program. The distribution function may then be determined by substitution of an easily calculated variable into the distribution function of the random variable. The results are useful in the solution and analysis of a number of financial optimization problems. Problems from the analysis of optimal capital accumulation and portfolio separation are treated in some detail.

## 10. Multiple Objective Linear Programming with Interval Criterion Weights
### Author(s):
- Ralph E. Steuer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
The purpose of this research is to develop a computer applicable methodology for analyzing multiple objective linear programming problems when interval, rather than fixed, weights are assigned to each of the objectives. Rather than obtaining a single efficient extreme point as one would normally expect with fixed weights, a cluster of efficient extreme points is typically generated when interval weights are specified. Then, from the subset of solutions generated, it is contemplated, that the decision-maker will be able to qualitatively identify his efficient extreme point of greatest utility (which should either be the decision-maker's optimal point or be close enough to it to terminate the decision process).

## 11. An Application of Z-Matrices to a Class of Resource Allocation Problems
### Author(s):
- Arie Tamir
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
This study focuses on allocation problems that have some of their constraints defined in terms of Leontief input-output matrices, known as Z-matrices. A few properties of these matrices are discussed and then applied to achieve a possible reduction in the dimensionality of the resource allocation models. An allocation problem of the above nature is the subject of the recent work of Luss and Gupta [Luss, M., S. K. Gupta. 1974. Allocation of marketing effort among P substitutional products in N territories. Oper. Res. Quart.25 7788.], who were concerned about optimal allocation of marketing efforts among substitutional products distributed in different sales territories. The reduction procedure is then applied to their model to yield several extensions.

## 14. NoteOn the Optimality of Sub-Batch Sizes for a Multi-Stage EPQ ModelA Rejoinder
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1976
### Abstract:
Goyal [Goyal, S. K. 1976. Note on Manufacturing cycle time determination for a multi-stage economic production quantity model. Management Sci.23 (3, November) 332333.] suggests an extension of the EPQ model described in [Szendrovits, A. Z. 1975. Manufacturing cycle time determination for a multi-stage economic production quantity model. Management Sci.22 (3, November) 298308.]. His simultaneous optimization of both the lot size (Q) and the number of sub-batches (b) is valid provided that the transportation cost of sub-batches through all stages can be established and that the transportation cost function is of the form he suggests. We should, however, examine the basic nature of transportation costs in a plant and their usual allocation. In practice, any system of transportation equipment and personnel must be designed to cope flexibly with unscheduled activities. The timing of transport operations and the variability in loading the equipment have a great influence on costs. In addition, this transportation system must handle a whole spectrum of products, and it is difficult to allocate the costs of the system to particular product lots. As a consequence, transportation costs in a plant are usually regarded as sunk costs and are treated accordingly in most of the multi-stage inventory models.
