## 1. The Substitution of Communication for TransportationA Case Study
### Author(s):
- David A. Lopez
- Paul Gray
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
The possibilities of substituting communications for transportation in urban settings is investigated in a case study of an insurance company. An optimization model is developed for determining the number and location of sites to be selected, and the results of the optimization are used as part of a cost/benefit analysis. It is concluded that such substitution is economically, operationally, and technically feasible for the firm studied and that such substitution would be of benefit to many firms in the information industries. The model, the analysis and the implementation of the results are discussed.

## 2. A Model for Planning the Transition to Equilibrium of a University Budget
### Author(s):
- David S. P. Hopkins
- William F. Massy
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
Five-year projections of university expense and income items are incorporated into a model requiring long-run financial equilibrium (LRFE) at the end of the planning period. LRFE means that both budget levels and growth rates are in balance. The transition to equilibrium model consists of a set of simultaneous linear equations that are solved for an estimate of the amount of budget base reductions needed to achieve LRFE five years later. The model was applied at Stanford University, the resulting $10.2 million budget adjustment target was accepted, and now (two years later) more than 85 percent of the needed changes have been implemented.

## 3. How Often Will the Firemen Get their Sleep?
### Author(s):
- John D. Finnerty
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
We calculate the expected additional fire protection cost to a city implied by the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under the amendments, if a city chooses not to pay its men who are on duty for more than 24 hours at a time for sleep and meal time, it may exclude up to eight hours of sleep time, but must compensate them at overtime rates for the entire sleep period if one or more alarms prevent them from obtaining at least five uninterrupted hours of sleep in that period. Interalarm times are modeled as a Poisson process, and both point and interval estimates of the additional annual overtime cost are computed for the city of Monterey by estimating the annual number of interrupted sleep periods. A model that permits the rate at which alarms are received and the length of die designated sleep period to be varied is developed for computing the proportion of nights in the year during which the firemen get five uninterrupted hours of sleep. A procedure for adjusting the model to allow for the time spent in response to an alarm is also described.

- David G. Dannenbring
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents computational experience with eleven flow shop sequencing heuristics. Included in the study are three previously unreported heuristics, one of which turns out to be superior to the other ten heuristics tested. The comparisons were made on a variety of problem sizes, up to fifty jobs and fifty operations.

## 5. An Algorithm for Deriving the Capital Market Line
### Author(s):
- Gordon J. Alexander
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
This paper examines the problem of deriving the tangent (or market) portfolio from a given set of risky assets and a specified risk-free borrowing and lending rate. Deriving the tangent portfolio involves solving a mathematical programming problem which can be specified as the minimization of a quadratic objective function with linear constraints. The complementary pivot algorithm has previously been shown to be capable of deriving the optimal solution to certain quadratic programming problems, subject to a nonnegativity constraint. This paper demonstrates that the algorithm can be used to derive the tangent portfolio and that the nonnegativity constraint does not pose any serious handicap. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithm can efficiently solve large-scale problems of this nature.

## 6. Multilocation Plant Sizing and Timing
### Author(s):
- Ram C. Rao
- David P. Rutenberg
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
In this paper we solve a dynamic multilocation problem. Time is continuous, and demands can grow at varying rates in different markets and at different times. There are economies of scale in building plant capacity. To solve such a problem conditional on a prescribed sequence, we show how to use recent insights into the transportation problem to develop constructive algorithms that are computationally viable and attractive even for large problems. With plant sizes held constant, transportation cost is optimized through continuous time so as to set plant timings. We then treat the plant sizes (and some timings) as continuous variables in a feasible directions procedure to move towards a local optimum.

## 7. Optimizing Claims Fluctuation Reserves
### Author(s):
- Christoph Haehling von Lanzenauer
- Don D. Wright
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
Many group insurance programs are characterized by experience rating features which imply that a surplus resulting from favorable experience belongs to the group, while the administering insurance company is to be reimbursed for a deficit resulting from unfavorable experience. Due to the volatile nature of claims, a claims fluctuation reserve is frequently established in order to reduce frequent rebates or premium adjustments resulting from surplus or deficit positions. A model is presented for resolving the rebate question and determining the design parameters of a claims fluctuation reserve. The model is formulated for non-stationary conditions and uses the first passage time concept as part of a chance constraint criterion. Results of an actual application are reported.

## 8. Geometric Approaches to Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem
### Author(s):
- John P. Norback
- Robert F. Love
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
Two geometric approaches to solving sequencing problems are described and tested. Both methods have yielded optimal or near optimal solutions in problems where the optimal is known. Further, these methods have the advantage of being programmable, with execution in relatively short computation times, even for large problems. (The largest tested was composed of 318 cities.) One of these methods (the largest angle method) can be used to generate tours without any computation, if the number of cities is less than 25 or so, giving the practitioner an effective back of the envelope method of finding solutions. The results include applications to problems previously reported in the literature as well as several original large problems. The tours, their costs and computation times are presented.

## 9. Incorporating Thresholds of Indifference in Probabilistic Choice Models
### Author(s):
- K. S. Krishnan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
Probabilistic choice models are often based on utility concepts which call for assessments by decision makers of available alternatives. These models assume that distinct utilities can be derived from the decision maker's expressed preferences. Such an assumption is generally valid if the decision maker can recognize arbitrarily small utility differences. If the decision maker is indifferent between the alternatives the corresponding utilities are expected to be similar. In this paper, the concept of minimum perceivable difference is introduced into the conventional binary logit model. It is postulated that two alternatives are perceived as different only if the absolute difference in their utilities exceeds a positive constant. For estimating the parameters of the new model a maximum likelihood technique is employed, and an empirical test of the model is conducted using data on travelers' choice of mode for accessing commuter rail service from Lindenwold (New Jersey) to downtown Philadelphia. The model predicts individuals' choices in a holdout sample significantly better than the conventional logit model.

## 10. An Investment Strategy with Overshoot Rebates which Minimizes the Time to Attain a Specified Goal
### Author(s):
- Donald C. Aucamp
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
A strategy is developed which minimizes the expected time (or plays) to reach a given financial goal when time rebates are given if the goal is more than attained in the last investment period. It is shown that the optimal strategy is the one which maximizes the expected logarithm of the investment relative (for discrete distributions this is equivalent to maximizing the geometric mean). This strategy is optimal for all goals and levels of capital. When no time rebates are given, however, the proposed strategy will generally not be optimal. In this case the theory shows the strategy is uniformly good. Further, at least in a limited sense, the true optimal will generally differ significantly only in endgame play.

## 14. NoteA Computational Refinement for Discrete-Valued Dynamic Programs with Convex Functions
### Author(s):
- Don R. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
A search procedure is presented for discrete-valued dynamic programming problems with the objective of minimising the sum of convex functions. This procedure may be more efficient than available methods if the sum is to be minimized over a uniform grid of values of the state variable. Furthermore, the procedure can be used to reduce the computational effort if only some of the return functions have a special structure.

## 15. CommunicationA Comprehensive Model for Long Range Academic Strategies
### Author(s):
- Paul Gray
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1977
### Abstract:
The interest in using management science models for higher education manpower planning in recent years has led to the application of Markov chains, networks, goal programming, and other familiar modeling techniques. Goal programming appears intuitively appealing because educational objectives often involve satisficing rather than optimizing. It must be assumed that the purpose of the Walters, Mangold, Haran paper (Walters, A., J. Mangold, E. G. P. Haran. 1976. A comprehensive planning model for long-range academic strategies. Management Sci.22 (7) 727738.) was not simply to demonstrate that goal programming is of interest for this planning problem, since Schroeder (Schroeder, R. G. 1974. Resource planning in university management by goal programming. Oper. Res.22 (JulyAugust) 700710.) published such a demonstration two years previously.
