### Abstract:
The number of days required to clear a check drawn on a bank in city j depends on the city i in which the check is cashed. Thus, to maximize its available funds, a company that pays bills to numerous clients in various locations may find it advantageous to maintain accounts in several strategically located banks. We will discuss the problem of optimally locating bank accounts to maximize clearing times. The importance of this problem depends in part on its mathematical equivalence to the well-known uncapacitated plant location problem. We present a Lagrangian dual for obtaining an upper bound and heuristics for obtaining a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution. Our main results are analytical worst-case analyses of these bounds. In particular we show that the relative error of the dual bound and a greedy heuristic never exceeds [(K  1)/K]k < 1/e for a problem in which at most K locations are to be chosen. Two other heuristics are shown to have worst-case relative errors of at least (k  1)/(2K  1) < 1/2. Examples are given showing that all these bounds can be achieved. We present extensive computational results for these approximations.

## 2. Tolls: Efficiency and Equity Issues for Inland Waterways
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
Transportation requires large amounts of capital in fixed facilities such as roads, tracks, or canals. Inland waterway transport is unique among modes, since it neither owns its right-of-way nor pays taxes to support its construction and maintenance. Although user charges are widely employed to recover the costs of publicly provided investments, proper theoretical foundation has not been made for their application to inland waterway transport. In this paper we shall provide this foundation focusing on efficiency of allocation of resources, on equity of taxation, and on administration simplicity of each toll scheme. Section 1 of this paper presents the criteria to be used in evaluating waterway user charges. Section 2 appraises possible alternative tolls and estimates the rates that would be needed to recover current expenditures. A combination of toll schemes (segment tolls, locking fees, and congestion tolls) are argued to be economically and politically feasible and to dominate fuel taxes and license fees. The Appendix presents an example of the benefits and costs of waterway expansion and a test of the predictive power of the queueing model.

## 3. Cognitive and Personality Tests for the Design of Management Information Systems
### Author(s):
- M. L. Bariff
- E. J. Lusk
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
Presently observation and interviews are used in gathering information to facilitate organizational acceptance of MIS modifications. The authors propose that the measurement and evaluation of users' cognitive styles and related personality traits may provide an effective means for attaining successful MIS modifications. The authors suggest that two aspects of cognitive and personality traits are relevant to user adaptive behavior: (1) cognitive style and (2) implementation apprehension, e.g., resistance to change, defense mechanisms and stress tolerance. These design aspects are incorporated in a field study.

## 4. Time-Cost Tradeoffs: Elasticity Estimates and Determinants for International Technology Transfer Projects
### Author(s):
- David Teece
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
This paper postulates and tests for a time-cost tradeoff during the establishment of manufacturing plants abroad based on U.S. technology. Data on twenty international projects are used to estimate negatively sloped tradeoff functions for which time-cost elasticities are subsequently calculated. The determinants of these elasticities are then analyzed and shown to bear some similarities with the determinants of time-cost tradeoffs in technological innovation. The elasticity measurements were higher for projects where the technology had not been previously commercialized, for large-scale projects, and for projects carried out by the larger firms.

### Author(s):
- Robert R. Trippi
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
This article develops an empirical model for estimating the relationship between selling price and length of time on market for a unique, large-ticket item. The model provides valuable information in the form of probability statements concerning the length of time to sale at any given price for a capital asset having a well-defined set of characteristics.

## 6. A Markov Quality Control Process Subject to Partial Observation
### Author(s):
- Chelsea C. White
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
This paper studies the problem of optimally controlling a discrete-time production process with countable state space which is subject to one of three control settings at each time interval: produce, inspect while producing, or repair (revise) the process. The cost of the item produced and the inspection and repair costs are assumed dependent on the state of the production process. It is assumed that the inspector-decisionmaker receives imperfect on-line observations of the production process at both times of production and inspection. Bounds on optimal cost are obtained. For the two-state case, several results associated with observation quality are determined which are sufficient for particularly simple characterizations of an optimal policy. Generalizations of several results due to Ross are also presented.

## 8. The Generalized Slack Variable Linear Program
### Author(s):
- T. H. Mattheiss

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
The dilemma of when to cease analysis of a subproblem and go on to the next subproblem in convex programming is an especially difficult one. This paper views convex programming as an extension of linear programming and focuses attention on the analysis of a given subproblem. Specifically, if K = {xAx  b} is bounded with a nonempty interior and represents a residual unsearched region in some convex programming algorithm, what is (are) the best trial point(s) which can be selected? The generalized slack variable linear program (GSVLP) provides a mechanism for implementing trial point selection based on many strategies. Several implications of the L2 norm are revealed which are especially important in constraint deletion and rate of reduction of the hypervolume of the residual search region K.

## 9. A Methodology for Assigning Minimum Cost Due-Dates
### Author(s):
- James K. Weeks
- John S. Fryer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents and illustrates a methodology for estimating minimum cost due-dates in a job shop production system. Simulation of a hypothetical dual-constrained job shop is used to derive response measures of shop performance for various dispatching, labor assignment and due-date assignment rules. Multiple linear and nonlinear regression is used to estimate the relationship between the response measures and the value of K, the multiple of total processing time employed in assigning due-dates, for various dispatching-labor assignment operating policies. Five response measures are used as dependent variables for the regression models. They are mean job flow-time cost, mean job lateness cost, mean job earliness cost, mean job due-date cost, and mean labor transfer cost. The coefficients of the regression analysis are employed to predict shop performance in terms of the five component cost measures for varying levels of K given the dispatching-labor assignment operating policy. The estimated relationships between the component cost measures and the decision roles are combined to form a total cost function. The total cost function is then searched to find the minimum cost due-date multiple for each of the various dispatching-labor assignment policies. Graphical results indicate that the minimum cost multiple K employed to assign due-dates and the sensitivity of costs to deviations from this minimum cost multiple may depend on the cost structure and dispatching-labor assignment operating policy considered. Further, the results suggest that regression analysis of simulation results can be used to estimate due-dates and select dispatching and labor assignment rules for desired performance effects.

## 10. Scheduling a Project to Maximize Its Present Value: A Zero-One Programming Approach
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Doersch
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
A zero-one integer programming formulation of the project scheduling problem is reported which maximizes the discounted value of cash flows in a project when progress payments and cash outflows are made upon the completion of certain activities. While this problem has been treated previously, it has not been addressed in a manner which allows for the type of constraints treated in this paper. And while cash can be treated as any other resource in the noncash flow, resource-constrained version of this problem, the effects of cash inflows and outflows and the time sequencing alternatives for them allow for a different treatment of cash resources than has been previously reported.

## 11. Discounting, Ergodicity and Convergence for Markov Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Morton
- William E. Wecker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
The rate at which Markov decision processes converge as the horizon length increases can be important for computations and judging the appropriateness of models. The convergence rate is commonly associated with the discount factor . For example, the total value function for a broad set of problems is known to converge 0(n), i.e., geometrically with the discount factor. But the rate at which the finite horizon optimal policies converge depends on the convergence of the relative value function. (Relative value at a given state is the difference between total value at that state and total value at some fixed reference state.) Relative value convergence in turn depends both on the discount factor and on ergodic properties of the underlying nonhomogeneous Markov chains. We show in particular that for the stationary finite state space compact action space Markov decision problem, the relative value function converges 0(()n) for all  > r(P), the argument of the subdominant eigenvalue of the optimal infinite horizon policy (assumed unique). Easily obtained bounds for r(P) are also given which are related to those of A. Brauer. Under additional restrictions, policy convergence is shown to be of the same order as relative value convergence, generalizing work of Shapiro, Schweitzer, and Odoni. The same result gives convergence properties for the undiscounted problem and for the case  > 1. If r(P) > 1 the problem does not converge. As a by-product of the analysis, necessary conditions are given for the relative value function to converge 0(()n), 0 <  < 1, for the nonstationary problem.

## 12. NoteA Simplified Expression for the Efficient Frontier in Mean-Variance Portfolio Analysis
### Author(s):
- Stephen A. Buser
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
The identification of an important but previously overlooked technical property of minimum-variance portfolios greatly simplifies both the derivation of and the expression for the efficient frontier in mean-variance portfolio analysis. These simplifications permit a corresponding reduction in the analytics required to examine and to interpret essential properties of the model including comparative-static results and mutual-fund theorems.

## 13. NoteOn the Use of Fictitious Bounds in Tree Search Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Mokhtar S. Bazaraa
- Alwalid N. Elshafei
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1977
### Abstract:
One of the strategies used by many tree search algorithms is to follow down one path in the tree until either a feasible solution is found or else fathoming occurs. For a minimization problem, the lower bounds calculated at various tree nodes tend to be well below the optimal value of the objective function, let alone the values of the successively improving upper bounds. As a result fathoming usually occurs only deep in the tree, and consequently, the search becomes rather lengthy. The purpose of this note is to describe a procedure for using and updating fictitious upper bounds in a systematic way so that optimal and suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational effort. The procedure is illustrated by two examples: the traveling salesman problem and the quadratic assignment problem.

### Abstract:
This is in reference to the article, A Survey of Users of Corporate Planning Models, by Mr. Naylor and Mr. Schauland, Management Science, May 1976. While I would like to compliment the authors on their excellent work, I have to disagree with them strongly when they say that: Corporate models which have been written in scientific programming languages like FORTRAN and APL do not tend to be very user-oriented.
