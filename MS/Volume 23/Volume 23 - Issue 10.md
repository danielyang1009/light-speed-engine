## 1. An Empirical Analysis of the Optimal Advertising Policy
### Author(s):
- Dan Horsky
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper determines an optimal policy for investment in advertising for a firm that wishes to maximize its discounted profits. To that end, an integrated approach consisting of model formulation, empirical investigation, and optimization is carried out. A model of market share response to advertising is formulated as a first-order Markov process, with nonstationary transition probabilities. These probabilities are assumed to be a function of the advertising goodwill accumulated by the firm and its competitors. The model as specified is nonlinear in its parameters, and nonlinear regression techniques are applied to estimate them. It is shown that this nonlinear form offers, via likelihood ratio tests, a unique opportunity for testing the model, and in a resulting empirical test, the model is found to be consistent with the data. Given these empirical findings, an optimal advertising policy is derived by the use of optimal control theory. The managerial implications of the recommended multi-period policy are examined, and the policy's sensitivity to managerial inputs and economic conditions is analyzed and illustrated.

## 2. Implications of Resource Directive Allocation Models for Organizational Design
### Author(s):

- Jeffrey H. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper develops theoretical results, for a class of coordination mechanisms for resource allocation in decentralized firms, using as a model the decomposition of linear programs. Of the two pure decentralized allocation mechanisms (price-directive and resource-directive), resource-directive mechanisms, based in concept upon rationing or budgeting procedures, have received less attention in the literature. This paper focuses on these mechanisms and reports that under rather mild conditions the use of the plausible and economically appealing rule of allocating a global resource so as to equalize its marginal value over alternate uses is almost surely doomed to failure. In particular it is found that (1) resource-directive decompositions induce a kind of structural degeneracy in the decentralized divisions; (2) the amount of degeneracy increases with the number of divisions and the number of scarce global resources; and (3) degeneracy seeks its own level in that degeneracies spread over the divisions. The implication of these results for those interested in organizational design is that caution should be observed in utilizing such a rule as equalizing marginal values, and that more complicated and costly procedures for effecting resource allocation may be required. Finally, some symmetries between price-directive and resource-directive mechanisms are summarized.

## 3. Determination of the Product Mix and the Business Policy of an Insurance CompanyA Portfolio Approach
### Author(s):
- Yehuda Kahane
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper sets out a model which simultaneously determines the optimal composition of the insurance and investment portfolios of an insurance company using Sharpe's Single-Index Technique. This technique can be explained for management as follows: different product lines that a multi-product firm offers have different rates of return and different risks associated with those rates of return. Taking into account both risks and rates of return, what is the best mix of product lines for a firm to offer in the marketplace? This approach is especially suitable for insurance because of data limitations. This type of analysis can make a useful contribution in shaping the firm's product mix and marketing policy.

## 4. Lot Sizing and Sequencing for N Products on One Facility
### Author(s):
- Christian M. Delporte
- L. Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
The problem of determining both lot sizes and repeating sequences for N products on one facility is difficult due to the combinatorial and continuous nature of the problem. The work that has been done on the problem has made various assumptions (zero-switch rule or equal lot size, for example) to simplify the problem. Several heuristics have been suggested that come fairly close to a computable lower bound on cost.

## 5. Simultaneous Investment and Allocation Decisions Applied to Water Planning
### Author(s):
- Ronald D. Armstrong
- Cleve E. Willis
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper develops models for water planning that simultaneously consider investment and allocation decisions. The framework is demonstrated for a region which includes the counties of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara in California. The quadratic discontinuous mathematical programming problems-resulting from such models are solved optimally by using generalized Benders decomposition. Benders decomposition is a method for breaking a larger problem into a series of manageable subproblems which yield feasible solutions to the overall system. In this case the decomposition is used to incorporate a quadratic programming allocation subproblem with an integer programming investment sequencing problem.

## 6. A Stochastic Model of Demand Forecasting for Technical Manpower Planning
### Author(s):
- N. K. Kwak
- Walter A. Garrett, Jr.
- Sam Barone
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents a stochastic technique for short-term demand forecasting of manpower requirements for a particular functional skin group. The demand model is adaptable to any organization in which the demand for services from a skill group is derived from several projects or activities. Working from these multi-project demands for skill group services, Bayesian decision analysis is used to produce a composite forecast of total skill group manpower demand. Options in the model provide for selectively varying the number and level of detail of the multi-project demand curves. The output of the model is useful for further manpower planning.

## 7. The Design of Problem-Solving Systems
### Author(s):
- Werner Ulrich
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
Problem solving, from a systems point of view, is to be considered as a complex, cognitive-affective process of formation and reorganization of conceptual systems. Conceptualization of problem-solving systems includes the development of a problem solver's possible points of view, their naming by explicitly introduced terms, and finally elaboration of ideal-typical formal design models. This paper suggests a taxonomic framework that elaborates and interconnects six design viewpoints, in order to give the problem solver (comprehended as a systems designer) better conceptual support than the general systems concept which is still mechanistically employed. These viewpoints furnish corresponding formal design ideals for the design and improvement of problem-solving processes. They must be completed by both normative premises and behavioral science concepts.

## 8. Decision Models for Individual Scientists Involved in Basic Research
### Author(s):
- Jerold L. Zimmerman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
Management science has not produced useful (operational) models for managers of basic research. This paper attempts to model the decision process of individual scientists. A number of models are developed and their applicability discussed, including their ability to generate insights and testable hypotheses. In order to increase the model's applicability, an alternative specification of behavior is recommendeda behavioral conceptualization of die scientist as a REMM (a Resourceful, Evaluative, Maximizing Man).

## 9. A Strategy Which Maximizes the Geometric Mean Return on Portfolio Investments
### Author(s):
- James H. Vander Weide
- David W. Peterson
- Steven F. Maier
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
A common formulation of the portfolio selection problem leads to the prescription of a strategy which maximizes the geometric mean return on investments. In this paper we examine conditions under which solutions exist for the case where the returns distribution is discrete. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist and give a computationally convenient and exact method for finding a solution in circumstances where (i) a solution exists and (ii) the number of securities equals or exceeds the number of values in the returns distribution.

## 10. Policies for Reducing Blood Wastage in Hospital Blood Banks
### Author(s):
- M. Barry Dumas
- Manus Rabinowitz
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents new operational policies for reducing wastage (due to blood exceeding its transfusable age limit) without adversely affecting shortages (stockouts). One policy, called double-crossmatching, tests the same unit of blood for compatibility with two potential recipients (so that it is available for use by either) and also insures that blood is available for both. Another policy involves using Rh-negative blood for Rh-positive patients under certain blood-age conditions, when medically feasible. The simultaneous use of both policies is also investigated. The performance of these policies is measured by wastage-cost effectiveness over a range of demand levels and by blood type. Operational procedures for using these policies are also discussed.

## 11. The m-Center Problem: Minimax Facility Location
### Author(s):
- R. S. Garfinkel
- A. W. Neebe
- M. R. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
The m-Center Problem is to locate a given number of (emergency) facilities anywhere along a road network so as to minimize the maximum distance between these facilities and fixed demand locations assigned to them. Fundamental properties of the m-Center Problem are examined. The problem is modeled using integer programming, and is successfully attacked using a binary search technique and a combination of exact tests and heuristics. Computational results are given.

### Author(s):
- Thom J. Hodgson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1977
### Abstract:
It is shown that Lawler's efficient (order n2) algorithm for the n-job, one-machine scheduling problem (where the objective is to minimize the maximum deferral cost subject to arbitrary precedence relationships) also applies when the processing times are random variables and the objective is to minimize the maximum expected deferral cost. Several special cases are explored.
