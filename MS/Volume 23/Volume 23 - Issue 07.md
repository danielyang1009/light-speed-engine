## 1. Allocating Selling Effort Via Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Charles A. Beswick
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This article presents a model for allocating selling effort and setting sales force size which explicitly considers interactions with territorial design, forecasting, and performance evaluation. An extremely fast, dynamic programming algorithm for the allocation of selhng time to control units is presented, and a proof of the optimality of this solution under specified conditions is provided. This algorithm also generates the optimum sales force size and provides output which is a basis for designing sales territories. The allocation algorithm can accommodate a large class of multivariate response functions. The model also incorporates subjective judgment into the decision process. Interaction with sales management of a test firm has shown that the model is highly useful in pinpointing problem areas, in evaluating salesmen, and in designing territories which can, to a large degree, achieve the benefits of the optimum allocation generated by the model.

## 2. Combining Expert Judgments: A Bayesian Approach
### Author(s):
- Peter A. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new approach to the problem of expert resolution. The proposed analytic structure provides a mechanism by which a decision maker can incorporate the possibly conflicting probability assessments of a group of experts. The approach is based upon the Bayesian inferential framework presented in [Morris, P. A. 1974. Decision analysis expert use. Management Sci.20 (9, May)].

## 3. Capacity Expansion with Imports and Inventories
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
Models for planning capacity expansion typically have excluded the possibility of using inventories to delay expansion decisions. In this paper some properties are derived for an optimal expansion plan allowing inventories, and a dynamic programming model is formulated for determination of optimal expansion, inventory, and import decisions under an assumption of linearly growing demand. Some computational results for the capacity expansion of India's aluminum industry indicate the roles for inventory and import decisions in an expansion plan, and the sensitivity of these decisions to changes in relative costs.

## 4. Multi-Criteria School Busing Models
### Author(s):
- Sang M. Lee
- Laurence J. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents multi-criteria school busing models. More specifically, it reports on the application of goal programming to the school busing problem in order to achieve multiple, conflicting objectives. The models attempt to derive optimal solutions in order to reflect such goals as providing educational opportunity to children, striving for a racial balance, balancing overcrowding among schools, permitting the community school concept, and minimizing total transportation costs. The study offers practical applications of the approach to the complex social issue of busing.

## 5. The Value of Information Given Decision Flexibility
### Author(s):
- M. W. Merkhofer
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This paper explores the effect of decision flexibility on the value of information. The usefulness of calculating the value of information under various assumptions concerning decision flexibility is illustrated with a simple economic example. An upper limit to the value of information given some level of flexibility is the expected value of perfect information given undiminished flexibility (EVPIGUF). By approximating an arbitrary smooth value function with a quadratic equation, first order characteristics of the EVPIGUF are identified. Finally, it is shown that sensitivity analysis can be used as a basis for obtaining simplified approximations for EVPIGUF's.

## 6. Horizon Effects in Aggregate Production Planning with Seasonal Demand
### Author(s):
- John O. McClain
- Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
When a demand pattern is dominated by a seasonal effect, the concept of a steady state solution can be used in two ways in aggregate production planning. First, general policy recommendations can be made concerning the use of seasonal workforce changes versus overtime and seasonal inventory. Second, the results can be used to provide ending conditions in an intermediate range planning algorithm with a moving horizon. These ideas are explored using a linear programming model, making use of known planning horizon properties. A simulation experiment tests the efficacy of short horizon deterministic models in a stochastic environment, and demonstrates that ending conditions, derived from the steady state model, improve decisions under a variety of conditions on costs and horizon length.

## 7. Finding Equivalent Network Formulations for Constrained Network Problems
### Author(s):
- Darwin Klingman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes a procedure for determining if constrained network problems (i.e., network problems with additional linear constraints) can be transformed into equivalent pure network problems by a linear transformation involving the node constraints and the extra constraints. These results extend procedures for problems in which the extra constraints consist of bounding certain partial sums of variables. This has proved to be an effective managerial technique for a major automobile manufacturer and a major energy modeling company.

## 8. A Time Series Approach to Queueing Systems with Applications for Modeling Job-Shop In-Process Inventories
### Author(s):
- Harold J. Steudel
- S. M. Wu
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
The behavior of a uniformly sampled queueing system is characterized and interpreted using a time series approach. The advantages of employing time series to obtain a model of the queue's behavior are shown to be simplicity, flexibility and reliability. An analysis of actual queue data shows that the queue behavior of a uniformly sampled queueing system with a single server and Poisson-exponential activities is adequately described by a first order autoregressive model. The autocorrelation function is used to relate queueing theory and the time series model to obtain the commonly required parameters for a queueing system, in a manner independent of the mean level of the queue.

## 9. A Discrete Time, Single Server Queue from a Finite Population
### Author(s):
- Do Le Minh
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
One of the standard assumptions in queueing theory is that the system operates for an indefinite period of time. This assumption, however, is not valid for many practical situations where there is only a finite number of customers and each customer requires service only once. This paper studies such a finite queueing system in which all customers have the same time-dependent arrival probability function.

## 10. Kalman Filtering Applied to Statistical Forecasting
### Author(s):
- G. W. Morrison
- D. H. Pike
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of the Kalman Filter in a certain ciass of forecasting problems. The time series is assumed to be modeled as a time varying mean with additive noise. The mean of the time series is assumed to be a linear combination of known functions. The coefficients appearing in the linear combination are unknown. Under such assumptions, the time series can be described as a linear system with the state vector of the system being the unknown parameters and present value of the mean of the process. The Kalman Filter can be used under these circumstances to obtain an optimal estimate of the state vector. One of the distinct advantages of the Kalman Filter is that time varying coefficients can be permitted in the model. Examples using the Kalman Filter in forecasting are presented.

## 11. The T-Policy for the M/G/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- Daniel P. Heyman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
We consider situations where the server cannot continuously monitor its queue to sense customer arrivals. For this situation we introduce the T-policy which activates the server T time units after the end of the last busy period. We consider in detail an M/G/1 queue with linear customer holding costs and a fixed charge for activating the server. For the minimum cost-rate criterion we obtain the optimal value of T and the optimal cost rate. We show that the optimal cost rate is larger than the one achieved by the comparable optimal N-policy which activates the server when N customers are in the queue. We also show that under the optimal T-policy, the expected number of customers present when the server is activated is the optimal value of N.

## 12. Mathematical Programming of Admissible Portfolios
### Author(s):
- Vijay S. Bawa
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1977
### Abstract:
It is well known that when the distribution of portfolio returns is normal, the admissible set of portfolios for risk-averse investors with increasing and concave utility functions is the Markowtiz-Tobin mean-minimum variance admissible boundary: The admissible set is obtained by minimizing a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints and can be obtained efficiently using Markowitz-Sharpe critical line algorithm. We show that the admissible set of portfolios for all investors (with increasing utility functions, including risk-averters, risk-seekers, risk-neutral and Friedman-Savage-type individuals) is the Markowitz-Tobin boundary plus a portion of the mean-maximum variance boundary. We propose a simple algorithm to obtain the mean-maximum variance boundary. Thus, our algorithm plus Markowitz-Sharpe algorithm obtains the admissible set of portfiolios for all investors.
