## 1. Managing the Incidence of Sickle Cell Anemia Through Genetic Counseling
### Author(s):
- Jack Meredith
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
Genetic counseling has long held promise as a means for controlling Tay-Sachs disease, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and a host of other untreatable genetic illnesses. This paper reports a study to investigate the long-term viability of genetic counseling as an alternative to searching for a cure for sickle cell anemia. The paper includes consideration of the relative lack of fitness of individuals with sickle cell anemia, the effect of mutation from normal to sickle hemoglobin, and the effect of interbreeding between the black and white races as well as the result of counseling specific proportions of the population with high risk rather than counseling everyone. The results project the theoretical rate of sickle cell anemia in the U.S. black population over the next 800 years, and are viewed qualitatively rather than as firm projections due to the preliminary nature of the counseling data and the simplifying assumptions of the model. They suggest that counseling programs can play a very large role in reducing the incidence of sickle cell anemia, even in the near future.

## 2. Procedures for Estimating Optimal Solution Values for Large Combinatorial Problems
### Author(s):
- David G. Dannenbring
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
This study focuses attention on methods for generating useful solution standards for large combinatorial problems. In particular, several procedures that provide point estimates of the value of the optimum solution are suggested and tested. These concepts are applied to a representative combinatorial problem: flow shop sequencing. Detailed computational results are presented.

## 3. Determining Sample Size for Pretesting Comparative Effectiveness of Advertising Copies
### Author(s):
- Siddhartha R. Dalal
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of determining optimal sample sizes in advertising pretests, where two or more copies are compared for their relative advertising effectiveness measured on a dichotomous (0 or 1) scale. As the sample size is increased, sampling variations decrease so that the pretest has a better chance of identifying the truly best ad. Consequently, increasing the sample size decreases the opportunity costs of not selecting the best ad which, however, have to be balanced against the increased sampling costs. Taking these two considerations into account, three approaches (indifference zone, minimizing maximum loss and Bayesian) for determining sample size are discussed. The minimizing maximum loss approach seems to offer the best compromise in terms of realistic modelling and practical implementability. Extensions of the approaches to the case where advertising effectiveness is measured on an interval scale are outlined.

### Author(s):
- William L. Berry
- Myles Marcus
- J. Greg Williams
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of Biased Sampling to solve an inventory planning problem at a firm which produces plastic coated steel products. In this application, the Biased Sampling solutions provided an estimate of the inventory investment savings to be obtained from a major capital investment proposal. The problem structure, the development of biasing procedures to guide the solution process, and the computational results are presented.

## 5. Generalized Programming by Linear Approximation of the Dual Gradient: Convex Programming Case
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Wagner
- J. Franklin Sharp
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
A modified version of Generalized Programming is presented for solving convex programming problems. The procedure uses convenient linear approximations of the gradient of the dual in order to approximate the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the dual. Solution points of these approximate Kuhn-Tucker conditions are then used for column generation. Computational results are reported.

## 6. A Model of a Multi-Product Two-Stage Inventory System with Limited Intermediate Bulk Storage Capacity
### Author(s):
- Hans G. Daellenbach
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
A firm has a limited number of bulk storage tanks available for intermediate storage. A joint decision as to the assignment of products to tanks and the inventory stocking and replenishing policy for each product has to be made. It is shown that for a given inventory policy the minimization of the total cost expression can be transformed into a nested optimization problem involving three phases. These can be optimized sequentially starting with the innermost phase. The last phase turns out to be a transportation problem. The solution for an example involving 18 products and 10 tanks is presented and discussed.

## 7. Production Runs for Multiple Products: The Two-Product Heuristic
### Author(s):
- Alan L. Saipe
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
The optimal solution is presented for the problem of determining production run sizes for two products which must be produced on the same machine. This solution forms the basis for a heuristic solution to the N product problem. This heuristic provides uniformly better results than the complete-cycle heuristic for this problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the method.

## 8. An Order-Level-Scheduling-Period System with Lost Sales
### Author(s):
- Israel Pressman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
An order-level-scheduling-period system with lost sales is considered. The zero leadtime case is analyzed first and a method for computing the total average cost is presented. The nonzero leadtime case is then treated for a scheduling period of one time unit. The average cost for this case depends on the distribution of the inventory available on hand. This random variable, on-hand inventory, is denoted by Q and its distribution is given by g(Q). Methodologies are presented for finding this distribution for any leadtime L. A comparison of the Markov chain approach and the direct solution approach for finding g(Q) is also given.

## 9. The Effects of Communication and Information Availability in an Experimental Study of a Three-Person Game
### Author(s):
- J. Keith Murnighan
- Alvin E. Roth
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of six communication/information conditions on the outcomes reached by three-person groups playing a characteristic function game. The game was played by a monopolist and two weaker players. The conditions consisted of six combinations which varied the amount of information available to the players and their ability to communicate with one another. The investigation focused on the effects of the independent variables and the relationship between the data and several game theoretic solution concepts. The results indicated that the monopolist's payoffs depended to a large extent on the communication/information conditions. Announcement of the payoff division and the availability of messages tended to reduce his payoffs. In conditions where no messages were allowed, the monopolist's payoffs increased over time. Although the data diverged significantly from the core, the situations which contributed to greater competition resulted in outcomes closer to the core. A comparison between von Neumann-Morgenstern solutions and the more general class of subsolutions indicated that subsolutions were more reflective of the behavior observed. In addition, the results over the entire set of conditions closely approximated the Shapley value, which has recently been shown to be a risk neutral player's expected utility for playing the game. Directions for future research were suggested.

## 10. The Markovian Queue with Bounded Waiting time
### Author(s):
- Bezalel Gavish
- Paul J. Schweitzer
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
The single-server queueing system is studied where arrivals are rejected if their waiting plus service times would exceed a fixed amount K. Applications of this model include equipment repair facilities and buffered communication devices with constant discharge rate receiving messages from a high-speed data channel. A procedure for computing the equilibrium behavior is described for the case of random arrivals and arbitrary service time requirements. Detailed analytic results and graphs are given for the case of exponentially distributed service time requirements, including the server utilization, rejection probability, mean time in system, mean server busy period, and the mean and probability density function of the virtual waiting time.

## 11. NoteA Note on Critical Ratio Scheduling: An Experimental Analysis
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
A recent journal article [Berry, W. L., Rao, V. 1975. Critical ratio scheduling: an experimental analysis. Management Sci.22 (2, October) 192201.] by Berry and Rao on job shop scheduling reported some counterintuitive results concerning the use of dynamic operating information in making priority scheduling decisions. The results of the article, based on a simulation experiment, indicate that dynamic information on queue waiting time at individual machines and on the inventory status of individual items fails to improve the performance of the production system. In fact, the reported performance of the dynamic rule was inferior to the static rules in five out of six cases. The purpose of this note is to call attention to the possibility that it is Berry and Rao's construction and/or use of this information, and not the value of the information itself, which is in question.

## 13. NoteA Comment on Keeney's Group Utility Axioms
### Author(s):
- John O. McClain
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1977
### Abstract:
Keeney has described a set of axioms which allows one to merge individual utility functions using a linear combination [Keeney, Ralph L. 1976. A group preference axiomatization with cardinal utility. Management Sci.23 140145]. This is a very handy result, especially because the linear combination is probably the most easily studied of all possible methods. This comment is intended to call attention to three concepts which aid in determining and interpreting the weights obtained and studying the structure of the group's preferences. These concepts have been illustrated in [McClain, John O., Vithala R. Rao. 1974. Tradeoffs and conflicts in evaluation of health system alternatives: methodology for analysis. Health Services Res. (Spring) 3552].
