### Abstract:
The use of computer based information-decision systems to support decision making in organizations has increased significantly in the last decade. Very little effort has been devoted, however, to determine what relationships exist between the structure of information presented for decision making and the ensuing effectiveness of the decision. This article summarizes a series of experiments. The Minnesota Experiments, which were conducted to examine the significance of various information system characteristics on decision activity. Several research programs administered in the period 19701975 are discussed in this paper. By varying the manner in which information was provided to participants in each experiment, the impact of various information system characteristics and individual differences on decision effectiveness was investigated. Analysis of the results shows that, in many cases, the decisions/decision-making process of the participants was affected by the information system structure and/or attributes of individual decision makers. The results suggest guidelines for the designers of information systems and fruitful avenues for continued research.

## 2. Storage-Retrieval Interleaving in Automatic Warehousing Systems
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves

- Leroy B. Schwarz
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
This paper extends work previously reported on storage assignment rules for automatic warehousing systems to include interleaving; that is, the sequencing of storage and retrieve requests. Using both continuous analytical models and discrete evaluation procedures, this paper compares the operating performance of several storage assignment/interleaving policies. The results indicate that significant reductions in crane travel time (and distance) are obtainable in some real-world and/or previously modeled situations via the proposed storage assignment/interleaving policies. These reductions may be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems. The storage assignment/interleaving policies may also be used to improve the design of proposed systems to achieve a more desirable balance between throughput and storage capacity. Although the system examined is a high-rise automatic warehouse, the results presented have implications for the warehousing function in general.

## 3. Planning Electric Power Generation: A Nonlinear Mixed Integer Model Employing Benders Decomposition
### Author(s):
- F. Noonan
- R. J. Giglio
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes the development and application of an optimization program that is used to help electric utilities plan investments for power generation. For each year over a planning horizon the program determines what types and sizes of generating plants should be constructed, so as to minimize total discounted cost while meeting reliably the system's forecasted demands for electricity. The problem is formulated as a large-scale, chance constrained, mixed integer program. The solution algorithm employs Benders' Partitioning Principle, a mixed integer linear programming code, and a successive linearization procedure. Computation costs are low and, in the important area of sensitivity analysis, the program offers special economies which make it attractive to power system planners. Computational results are presented for a full sized generation planning problem for the six New England states where the algorithm is currently being used for planning generating facilities.

## 4. The Effect of Uncertainty in Input Quantities on the Optimal Expected Input Combination
### Author(s):
- Yakov Amihud
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
The problem faced here by a firm whose input quantities are fluctuating is to choose the optimal combination of average input quantities so as to maximize expected revenue under a cost constraint. We show that for the prevailing production functions, the firm might find it optimal to increase the average use of the stochastic factor (even when such an increase will further increase uncertainty) at the expense of other, possibly certain factors. This holds even when increased uncertainty in input reduces total expected revenue. The solution is shown to depend on characteristics of the production function which are generally ignored in the classical theory of the firm. The model may be used in general maximization problems with underlying stochastic variables.

## 5. Work Stretch Properties for the Scheduling of Continuous Operations Under Alternative Labor Policies
### Author(s):
- James M. Lowerre
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
For a seven-day's-a-week operation in which N employees are needed on each weekday and n on each weekend day, with N at least as large as n, the work stretch is developed for each of several different rest policies. The work stretch is the number of consecutive work days between rest days. Additionally, work force size formulas are developed for policies not previously covered in the literature.

## 6. On a Fleet Sizing and Allocation Problem
### Author(s):
- S. C. Parikh
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
This paper deals with a practical application of queueing theory. In particular, an approximate but quick method is developed for solving a fleet sizing and allocation problem. The problem concerns an optimal allocation of the total available transport vehicle units to many fleets in such a way that all fleets provide (as nearly as possible) a uniform level of service. The level of service is measured in terms of the fraction of arriving orders for shipment delayed due to the lack of immediate availability of a transport vehicle unit. The method employs some new results in queueing theory for approximating the delay probability and the service facility size in multi-server systems. An illustrative example is included to demonstrate a way of applying the method.

## 7. Electric Power System Planning with Explicit Stochastic Reserves Constraint
### Author(s):
- Charles R. Scherer
- Leland Joe
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
The problem of optimal planning of an electric power system is formulated as a cost minimizing mixed-integer mathematical program. The model emphasizes system reliability, requiring reserve generating capacity such that a Loss of Load Probability criterion of one day in ten years is met. Integer variables are used in the model to express system reliability explicitly as a constraint on the system model. Results are given for several plant outage rates and demand levels. The results show that the reliability and rule-of-thumb approaches to system reserve planning can yield substantially different optimal system costs and configurations.

## 9. An Effective Subgradient Procedure for Minimal Cost Multicommodity Flow Problems
### Author(s):
- Jeff Kennington
- Mohamed Shalaby
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents a heuristic technique for obtaining good solutions to large multicommodity network flow problems. The general approach is to allocate the arc capacities among the individual commodities and hence decompose the problem into a set of one-commodity problems. The one-commodity problems are solved and the combined solution is compared to a lower bound. If the solution is within an acceptable deviation from the lower bound, the procedure terminates. Otherwise, the arc capacities are reallocated and the subprograms are resolved. The reallocation is based on a subgradient optimization approach. Hence, the heuristic technique involves no matrix operations which may lead to round-off errors, the storage requirements are modest, and almost all operations are carried out directly on one-commodity networks. The technique has been coded and the initial computational experience is encouraging.

## 10. NoteOn a Simultaneous Decision Model for Marketing, Production and Finance
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
A previous study attempting to evaluate the benefits of coordination of marketing, production and finance decisions by Damon and Schramm is examined. It is noted that because of a flaw in the formulation of the marketing sector, the numerical results reported in this study are difficult to interpret. General issues in the design of experiments for evaluating functional coordination are also addressed.

## 11. On a Simultaneous Decision Model for Marketing, Production and Finance: A Rejoinder
### Author(s):
- William W. Damon
- Richard Schramm
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
The primary focus of Welam's comment [Welam, Ulf Peter. 1977. On a simultaneous decision model for marketing, production and finance. Management Sci.23 (9, May) 10051009.] is the criticism of the specific form of the demand function used to Damon and Schramm [Damon, William W., Richard Schramm. 1972. A simultaneous decision model for production, marketing and finance. Management Sci.19 (October) 161172, (13)]. His criterion for evaluating the model appears to be the degree to which individual equations faithfully represent the modelled phenomena for all possible values of the endogenous variables. This test of model validity would reject the quadratic approximations of production costs in the Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon study [Holt, Charles C. et al. 1960. Planning Production, Inventories, and Work Force. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs.], and would reject the use of quadratic utility functions, since at some level of income or wealth marginal utility becomes negative.

### Author(s):
- W. Townsend
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
Each of n jobs is to be sequenced on m machines, with each job having a due date, and we wish to minimise the maximum tardiness of any job. The problem has been solved by Smith [Smith, W. E. 1956. Various optimizers for single-state production. Naval Research Logistics Quarterly3 5966] for the case of one machine. This note develops a branch-and-bound method for the general case.

## 15. NoteNested Decomposition of a Dynamic Energy Model
### Author(s):
- James K. Ho
### Published:
- 1 May 1977
### Abstract:
This paper reports computational experience in using a nested decomposition (staircase) algorithm to solve a version of Manne's linear programming model of U. S. energy options. Nested decomposition is found to be 28% to 52% faster than a direct simplex approach for our test problems. Effects of various computational strategies are also investigated. Our results indicate the applicability of nested decomposition to the important class of staircase linear programs arising from dynamic energy models.
