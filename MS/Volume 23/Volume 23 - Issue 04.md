## 1. Decomposition of a Multi-Period Media Scheduling Model in Terms of Single Period Equivalents
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
This paper develops a method for choosing advertising media plans for the next T-periods in order to maximize net discounted profits. Using the discrete maximum principle of Optimal Control Theory, it is shown that under certain conditions a T-period media model can be decomposed into a sequence of T one-period models together with the determination of the corresponding carry-over effects using an iterative procedure. The single period models with their objective functions modified to include the carry-over effects can be solved by conventional methods. Although the conditions for decomposition are not always satisfied, the heuristic solution procedure defined by the decomposition approach has been found to give close to optimal solutions in randomly generated test problems. The solutions obtained in these tests are usually better than the corresponding solutions obtained by the Little and Lodish type of heuristic applied to the present model. Finally, the T-period model is specialized to derive a steady-state formulation of an infinite horizon media planning problem.

## 2. Equity and Selective Pollution Abatement Procedures
### Author(s):
- R. Carbone

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
This paper centers on issues of equity which are related to least cost air pollution abatement strategies. Motivation is provided by a hypothetical example based on Knox County, Tennessee data. In this example substantial loss in economic efficiency occurs when all polluters are required to reduce emissions by the same rate, which is a popular kind of equity notion termed a benchmark solution. This notion of equity is shown to be equivalent to another which is related to the requirement that each polluter reduce by the proportion that he contributes to total controllable pollutant concentration at points in the region.

## 3. Evaluating Security Performance Forecasts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
The value of information is used to evaluate the worth of a forecast to the recipient. The basic concepts of information economics are augmented by modern Bayesian statistical methods to provide a means of learning about the true, but unknown, information structure and distribution of state probabilities. The value of information measure appears in this context to be useful in detecting temporal changes in the information structure, in a fashion somewhat analogous to the use of control limits.

## 4. Management of Program Storage in Computers

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
Computer systems play an increasingly important role in modern enterprises. Such systems represent a major investment, and their performance has major effects on profitability, utilization and user satisfaction. Much effort is therefore directed at the efficient management of these systems, and this paper is a step in this direction. Specifically, we consider the optimal allocation of programs and data to various storage devices in order to minimize the expected operational costs, subject to capacity and timing constraints. This problem is one of the many optimization problems that the system management faces, and its solution, though suboptimal for the whole system, might contribute considerably to the overall system's performance and costs. An effective procedure for the optimal (storage) allocation is presented, whose application to an actual large-scale operating system resulted in high (relative) savings. This procedure, with minor modifications, might be applied to many allocation problems which face users and management of computer systems.

## 5. Information Overload in Mechanical Processes
### Author(s):
- William V. Gehrlein

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
Information overload usually refers to a situation in which a decision-maker's performance is harmed by too much input information. Experiments have shown that better decisions can occur when selected information is withheld from the decision-maker. This paper suggests that the notion of information overload can apply also to purely mechanical processes. It is presumed that a paired-comparison measurement procedure which attempts to detect as many ordered pairs as possible in a set which is linearly ordered by some unidimensional attribute can identify only part of the underlying linear order L. This part is in the form of a partial order P which is a subset of L. An algorithm can then be applied to P in an attempt to identify ordered pairs in L which are not in P. Simulation experiments have shown that significantly more than 50 percent of the ordered pairs added to P by the construction process of the algorithm agree with their orders in L. However, it has also been discovered that the construction process is expected to yield better results (in a sense specified precisely in the paper) when its input is taken to be a subset of P which is obtained by removing selected ordered pairs from P. Thus, by withholding certain known and correct information from the input to the construction process, a better output is expected.

## 6. Optimal System Allocations with Penalty Costs
### Author(s):
- C. Derman
- G. J. Lieberman
- S. M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
We have N stages to sequentially construct I successful components. At each stage, we allocate a certain amount of money for the construction of a component. If y is the amount allocated, then the component constructed will be a success with probability P(y), where P is a continuous nondecreasing function satisfying P(0) = 0. After each component is constructed, we are informed as to whether or not it is successful. If, at the end of the N stages, we are i components short, then a final penalty cost C(i) is incurred. The problem is to determine at each stage how much money to allocate so as to minimize the total expected cost (construction cost plus penalty cost) incurred. The major result is that if C(i + 1)  C(i)  C(i + 2)  C(i + 1), and if yn(i) denotes the optimal value to allocate when i components are needed with n stages remaining, then yn(i) is nondecreasing in i and nonincreasing in n.

## 7. Economic Design of np Charts for Processes Subject to a Multiplicity of Assignable Causes
### Author(s):
- W. K. Chiu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
A model is developed for production processes which have an in-control state and may jump to one of several out-of-control states in course of time, each such state being associated with an assignable cause. The quality characteristic is an attribute so that an np-chart control scheme is applied. Various cost and time elements are included in the derivation of the loss-cost function. By minimizing this function with respect to the three control variables, namely, the sampling interval, the sample size and the acceptance number, the economically optimal control plan can be obtained. A numerical example is given using a new prior distribution. The results compare favourably with those derived from a matched single cause model.

## 8. Heuristic Scheduling of Activities under Resource and Precedence Restrictions
### Author(s):
- Arne Thesen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
This paper extends the field of heuristic algorithms for resource constrained scheduling problems in three important areas. First, an algorithm is introduced where the role of the heuristic scheduling urgency factor is expanded from one of solely determining the order in which activities are considered for scheduling at a given instant, to one of determining the combination of activities to be scheduled at this instant. Second, a new hybrid scheduling urgency factor capitalizing on the fact that this algorithm is sensitive to the absolute value rather than relative sequence of the urgency factors is introduced. Finally, a systematic approach to the evaluation of such algorithms is introduced. This includes the identification of relevant problem attributes and the adoption of evaluative concepts such as computational efficiency and analytic and systems effectiveness.

## 9. A Dual Concept and Associated Algorithm in Mean-Variance Portfolio Analysis
### Author(s):
- Roger J. Bowden
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
We consider in this paper the problem of allocation by an investor of his funds between a set of risky assets and a single safe asset, under conditions in which the separation theorem holds. Focussing in particular on the computationally more difficult case where no short sales are permitted, we exhibit a dual problem which arises naturally out of the saddle-point property implied in the Kuhn-Tucker optimising conditions. By showing how to solve this dual we derive a computationally straightforward method of solution for the optimum portfolio proportions and obtain a condition for every security to be held. We show briefly how the treatment can be extended to general homogeneous restrictions on portfolio proportions.

## 10. Capital Budgeting in the Decentralized Firm
### Author(s):
- Steven F. Maier
- James H. Vander Weide
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
In this paper we analyze the capital budgeting problem of an organization which contains a central headquarters and K divisions. The headquarters serves as the planner-coordinator of the capital budgeting process and is the only member of the organization which has access to the external capital markets. The K divisions make decisions regarding the set of capital projects each wants to accept. The capital budgeting problem of this decentralized organization is solved and analyzed with the aid of an algorithm based on mathematical decomposition. It is shown that (i) the decomposition algorithm does indeed converge to an optimal corporate solution, (ii) under reasonable assumptions, the marginal rate of return on the last dollar spent is the same for each division and is equal to the corporate headquarters' cost of capital, (iii) in some circumstances, the decomposition model will only select integral projects, and (iv) the optimal choice of projects for the firm is made independently by the divisions, each acting in its own self-interest. This last feature of the capital budgeting model suggests that the firm may be able to achieve the informational economies usually associated with a decentralized organization structure.

## 11. Due-Dates and Instantaneous Load in the One-Machine Shop
### Author(s):
- E. L. Heard
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1976
### Abstract:
The due-date assignment problem occurs when due-dates are assigned within, rather than outside, a job shop. This study explores the importance of instantaneous and future shop loads in setting due-dates in shops operating under due-date dependent queue discipline. The assignment of due-dates to arriving jobs in an m-machine shop is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming problem in the first part of this study. A computational experiment using dynamic programming is performed in the second part and due-dates are developed for specific instantaneous load conditions in a simulated one-machine shop. The importance of instantaneous and future shop loads for assigning due-dates in a one-machine shop, with constant interarrivals and exponential service times, is shown.
