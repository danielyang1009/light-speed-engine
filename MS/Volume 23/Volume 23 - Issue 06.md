### Abstract:
Alternative ways to alleviate the shortage of anesthesiologists in obstetric services have been investigated in three study stages. These were (1) a survey and detailed analysis of the existing situation in one metropolitan region of the United States, (2) the construction and validation of a computer simulation model to study the consequences of alternative practice modes with speed, with economy and requiring no human experimentation, and (3) the establishment of a methodology for selecting an optimal anesthesia team configuration. This in turn should aid administrators in establishing future manpower needs and enable more efficient allocations of existing staff. The methodology, incorporating the simulation model, provides team design charts which enable decision makers to arrive at a basis for enlightened tradeoffs between personnel-associated costs and quality of service. Service quality is measured in terms of temporary unavailability of anesthesia personnel with the proper skills for performing certain tasks when needed. This article documents the overall project mission, the data base, the methodologies used, and the study results.

## 2. Minimising Waiting Time Variance in the Single Machine Problem
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
- I. G. Chowdhury
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
The paper considers the problem of n given jobs to be processed on a single machine where it is desirable to minimise the variance of job waiting times. A theorem is presented to the effect that the optimal sequence must be V-shaped (i.e., the jobs must be arranged in descending order of processing times if they are placed before the shortest job, but in ascending order of processing times if placed after it), and an algorithm for determining the optimal solution is given. A heuristic method is proposed for solving the problem where n is large; this method requires very little computing and was found to produce very good results for a sample of problems of varying size. The concept of the efficient set is examined and heuristic methods for generating this set are given.

## 3. Quadratic Approximations of the Portfolio Selection Problem When the Means and Variances of Returns are Infinite
### Author(s):
- James A. Ohlson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
This paper derives quadratic approximations of the standard one-period portfolio selection model under the assumption that means and variances of returns are infinite. Samuelson [Samuelson, P. A. 1970. The fundamental approximation theorem of portfolio analysis in terms of means, variances, and higher moments. Rev. Econom. Stud.37 (October).], among others, has derived mean-variance approximations when moments are finite; hence, this paper weakens conditions sufficient to obtain quadratic approximations.

## 4. An Efficient Branch and Bound Algorithm for the Capacitated Warehouse Location Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes an efficient solution procedure for the warehouse location problem in which limitations on the amount of goods which can be handled are also imposed. The proposed branch-and-bound solution method is made efficient by developing dominance, lower and upper bounding procedures and branch and node selection rules utilizing the special structure of this problem. Computational results are provided for large sized problems.

## 5. Effectiveness of Nominal and Interacting Group Decision Processes for Integrating R&D and Marketing
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
Because R&D and marketing are dependent upon each other for new product development, it is imperative that they achieve consensus and organizational integration (a team spirit of collaboration and joint commitment). But, consensus and integration are often inhibited by the differing viewpoints of R&D and marketing, which are a natural consequence of their specialized organizational roles and cultures. There is a need for a process that will bridge these dissonant viewpoints and cultures, while otherwise preserving the specialized orientations of the two parties. The bridging properties of three group decision making processesnominal, interacting, and combined nominal-interactingwere tested by nine strategic planning teams, each composed of R&D and marketing personnel. The combined nominal-interacting process yielded very high levels of statistical consensus and group integration. The nominal process produced statistical consensus but it did not yield high levels of integration. The interacting process did not produce either consensus or integration. The results here and elsewhere indicate that consensus and collaboration problems between R&D and marketing may be alleviated by replacing the interacting decision making process, which is typically used by many organizations, with a combined nominal-interacting process.

## 6. The Just Noticeable Difference in Complexity of Jobs
### Author(s):
- Shlomo Globerson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the magnitude of Nonrepetitive Time (NRT) change that will be subjectively perceived as significant. NRT is a previously developed index of job complexity and NRT change can be identified with the Just Noticeable Difference of job complexity. Together, they enable the job designer to evaluate the nature of the jobs and to compare the complexity of one job to another. The results indicate that two jobs would be subjectively considered to be significantly different one from the other in terms of their complexity, if the NRT index of one of them is larger by approximately 100 percent than the other.

## 7. Dynamic Programming for a Stochastic Markovian Process with an Application to the Mean Variance Models
### Author(s):
- Juval Goldwerger
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents a fresh perspective on the Markov reward process. In order to bring Howard's [Howard, R. A. 1969. Dynamic Programing and Markov-Process. The M.I.T. Press, 5th printing.] model closer to practical applicability, two very important aspects of the model are restated: (a) We make the rewards random variables instead of known constants, and (b) we allow for any decision rule over the moment set of the portfolio distribution, rather than assuming maximization of the expected value of the portfolio outcome. These modifications provide a natural setting for the rewards to be normally distributed, and thus, applying the mean variance models becomes possible. An algorithm for solution is presented, and a special case: the mean-variability models decision rule of maximizing (/) is worked out in detail.

## 9. A Flow Augmentation Approach to the Network with Gains Minimum Cost Flow Problem
### Author(s):
- P. A. Jensen
- Gora Bhaumik
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
A network with gains has branches in which the ratio between the flow leaving a branch and the flow entering a branch is a positive constant called the gain. Branch gains may be greater or less than one. Such networks arise in water resources and electrical power planning problems, among others. This paper presents a dual method of finding the minimum cost flows in such a network. Computerized versions of the procedure have been tested on networks with up to 7,000 branches.

## 10. Optimal Engineering Design Under Uncertainty by Geometric Programming
### Author(s):
- Rolf D. Wiebking
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents an application of stochastic (posynomial) geometric programming to an optimal engineering design problem. A theory developed by Avriel and Wilde for calculating and bounding the expected value of the objective function is summarized. Moreover, a method known as the statistical error propagation method is used to calculate approximate confidence intervals for the cost function. Stochastic geometric programming is applied to the design of a conventional once-through condensing system for a steam power plant in the presence of uncertainty (e.g., fuel costs can vary with market conditions). It is shown how the design engineer can extract a considerable amount of information from the solution of merely one small optimization problem. If tighter bounds on the expected cost value are desired, knowledge of discrete probability distributions for the individual random parameters is required and additional optimization problems must be solved.

## 11. A Row Generation Scheme for Finding a Multi-Commodity Minimum Disconnecting Set
### Author(s):
- Yash P. Aneja
- R. R. Vemuganti
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
The multi-commodity minimum disconnecting set in a given network is of considerable interest in military operations. The present known methods of finding the multi-commodity minimum disconnecting set consist of implicit enumeration techniques or techniques which involve the solution of several specially structured linear integer programs known as set-covering problems. In this paper we present an efficient method of finding the multi-commodity minimum disconnecting set by solving a single set-covering problem. Extensions and computational experience are also discussed.

## 12. NoteA Note on Shwimer's Theorem A
### Author(s):
- Werner Dinkelbach
- Otto Rosenberg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1977
### Abstract:
In 1972 Joel Shwimer published some interesting research on the n-job, one-machine, sequence-independent scheduling problem with tardiness penalties  where the goal is to minimize the total penalty costs resulting from the tardiness of the jobs (Shwimer, J. 1972. On the n-job, one-machine, sequence-independent scheduling problem with tardiness penalties: a branch-bound solution. Management Sci.18 (6) B-301B313.). The proposed algorithm is essentially based on his Theorem A. Unfortunately the given proof of Theorem A contains an inconsistency. In this note we present a different proof of the mentioned theorem.
