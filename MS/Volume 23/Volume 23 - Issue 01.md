## 1. Optimal Investment Scheduling with Price-Sensitive Dynamic Demand
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
- Robert R. Trippi
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
A model is developed that integrates capital investment decisions with output and pricing decisions for a situation of growing demand. Conditions are derived for the model that permit application of a general approach for determining the optimal sequence and timing of investments in a continuous-time framework. The behavior of optimal pricing and output decisions is characterized analytically. Specific results are given for a quadratic cost and revenue case, and an example illustrates the form of a solution. Possible extensions of the model are also discussed.

## 2. The Attribute-Dynamic Attitude Model (Adam)
### Author(s):
- Milan Zeleny
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
The traditional compensatory multi-attribute model persists in being inconsistent with empirical findings. It is suggested here that the model is based on a number of significant conceptual simplifications. Although the individual choice behavior is partially characterized by randomness, the model attempts to reveal the underlying deterministic rationale of the choice behavior, abstracted from random fluctuations. If such a model is conceptually false then no stochastic refinement can validate it, although some statistical tests might be improved slightly. We need a different kind of deterministic choice rationale, a new paradigm, capable of explaining and predicting those changes, intransitivities and inconsistencies of the individual choice behavior for which we currently have only a stochastic explanation. Such a methodology can then be further refined via stochastic extension. The model presented here is designed to explain and predict changes in individual choice behavior under varying conditions of choice.

## 3. An Efficient Algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Nauss
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
In this note we present an efficient algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem and announce the availability of a callable FORTRAN subroutine which solves this problem. Computational results show that 50 variable problems can be solved in an average of 4 milliseconds and 200 variable problems in an average of 7 milliseconds on an IBM 360/91.

## 4. A Duality Theorem for a Nondifferentiable Fractional Programming Problem
### Author(s):
- Suresh Chandra
- T. R. Gulati
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
A fractional analogue of Sinha's problem [Sinha, S. M. 1966. A duality theorem for nonlinear programming. Management Sci.12 385.] is considered and duality theory is developed for it. This duality subsumes duality results of Chadha [Chadha, S. S. 1971. A dual fractional program. ZAMM51 560.] and Sinha [Sinha, S. M. 1966. A duality theorem for nonlinear programming. Management Sci.12 385.], and gives a dual to the minimum risk problem of stochastic programming studied by Bergthaller [Bergthaller, C. 1970. A quadratic equivalent of the minimum risk problem. Revue Roumaine Math. pur. appl.15 17.].

## 6. A Utility Criterion for Markov Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Stratton C. Jaquette
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
Optimality criteria for Markov decision processes have historically been based on a risk neutral formulation of the decision maker's preferences. An explicit utility formulation, incorporating both risk and time preference and based on some results in the axiomatic theory of choice under uncertainty, is developed. This forms an optimality criterion called utility optimality with constant aversion to risk. The objective is to maximize the expected utility using an exponential utility function. Implicit in the formulation is an interpretation of the decision process which is not sequential. It is shown that optimal policies exist which are not necessarily stationary for an infinite horizon stationary Markov decision process with finite state and action spaces. An example is given.

## 7. Acceleration of Lagrangian Column-Generation Algorithms by Penalty Function Methods
### Author(s):
- Richard P. O'Neill
- William B. Widhelm
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
A Lagrangian column-generation procedure is developed which retains the original problem functions for column generation but uses transformed penalty functions in the Lagrangian optimization. The class of penalty functions considered maintains the original order of differentiability and often enhances the optimization operation. Convergence is proven for convex problems and limited computational experience cited where the new procedure converges two to four times faster than the standard method. Certain modifications of these techniques to attack nonconvex problems are also presented.

## 8. A Budget Allocation Model for Large Hierarchical R&D Organizations
### Author(s):
- N. R. Baker
- W. E. Souder
- C. R. Shumway
- P. M. Maher
- A. H. Rubenstein
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
A model is developed which allocates an available budget to research alternatives subject to budgetary constraints on both organizational and technical entities. The solution algorithm is based on the out-of-kilter minimum cost network flow algorithm and is programmed for use in a time-share, conversational mode. Although the model does not describe the decision processes observed empirically, its output is sufficiently similar to actual allocations that it can be viewed as predictive. Strengths and weaknesses of the model are detailed based on questionnaire and interview data provided by the potential users of the system. The decision information system is used to illustrate that experimentation concerned with better understanding of the adoption process can be used to facilitate model design and application.

## 10. An Improved Heuristic Procedure for a Nonlinear Cutting Stock Problem
### Author(s):
- I. Coverdale
- F. Wharton
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
Many industries acquire stocks of material in large standard sizes which are then reduced to required widths or lengths according to demand. Scheduling the cutting operations is a particularly difficult problem when a few cutting patterns must be chosen from a vast number of feasible patterns such that the total cost of the reduction process is minimised. Physical constraints and economic considerations restrict the number and type of pattern which can be used.

## 11. NoteA Test for Nonoptimal Actions in Undiscounted Finite Markov Decision Chains
### Author(s):
- N. A. J. Hastings
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
A test for nonoptimal actions in undiscounted Markov decision chains is proposed. The test eliminates actions for one or more stages after which they may re-enter the set of possibly optimal actions, but as convergence proceeds such re-entries cease.

## 13. NoteOn Marketing Strategy and the Optimal Production Schedule
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
Several models for joint optimization of functional decision making have been presented during the last few years. This note comments on one of these models described in a recent article in this journal, Marketing Strategy and the Optimal Production Schedule [Leitch, R. 1974. Marketing strategy and the optimal production schedule. Management Sci.21 (3, November).], and argues that there are rather serious deficiencies both with respect to the design of the model and the numerical experiments reported in the aforementioned article.

## 15. NoteA Note on Goal Decomposition in a Decentralized Organization
### Author(s):
- James R. Freeland
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
The purpose of this note is to show that Ruefli's Generalized Goal Decomposition Model does not allow one to interpret the solution routine as a decentralized process with respect to information processing and decision making. It is then shown how the application of a partitioning algorithm within Ruefli's framework can overcome these interpretation shortcomings.

## 16. NoteA Note on the Criss-Cross Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Lt. Commander W. S. Shields
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1976
### Abstract:
The Criss-cross linear programming method formulated by Zionts (Zionts, Sanley. 1969. The criss-cross method for solving linear programming problems. Management Sci.15 (7, March) 426445.), although remarkably efficient for small problems (Zionts [Zionts, Sanley. 1972. Some empirical tests of the criss-cross method. Management Sci.19 (4, December) 406410.]), often requires an excessive number of iterations for problems of size 40  40 or larger. Garfinkel and Yu (Garfinkel, Robert S., P. L. Yu. 1974. The composite simplex algorithm. Paper MA10.4. Joint National ORSA/TIMS Meeting, Boston, 22 April.) reported 3 such problems for which it terminated short of solution after 1000 pivots. Fortunately, the algorithm can be salvaged. All that is needed is a minor pivot rule change.
