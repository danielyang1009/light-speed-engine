## 2. A Parsimonious Description of the Hendry System
### Author(s):

- Donald G. Morrison
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
In this paper we will present some basic concepts of the Hendry System and derive the results claimed in the HendroDynamics Chapters [HendroDynamics: Fundamental Laws of Consumer Dynamics, Hendry Corporation, Chapter 1 (1970) and Chapter 2 (1971).] from two simple probabilistic assumptions; namely, zero order consumers and switching proportional to market share. We will develop the notion of partitioning which constitutes a major component of the Hendry System by briefly describing the procedure for identifying the partitioning structure in a given market. With this illustration we will point out various implications which can be drawn from a correctly identified market structure. All of our results are obtained without resorting to the entropy concept that has caused so much confusion in recent debates over the validity or usefulness of the Hendry Model.

## 3. Stochastic Dominance Tests for Decreasing Absolute Risk-Aversion II: General Random Variables
### Author(s):
- R. G. Vickson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for stochastic dominance over the class of decreasing absolute risk-averse utility functions. The random variables being compared may be continuous as well as discrete but are assumed to be bounded from below, to have finite means, to have only finitely many mass points in finite intervals, and to have cumulative distribution functions which cross one another only finitely many times, or touch one another only finitely many times in finite intervals. The precise forms of the dominance tests depend upon the number of times the distribution functions cross. An example of the DSD test is presented, and a dynamic programming algorithm for carrying out the general test is given.

## 4. Further Results on Planning Horizons in the Production Smoothing Problem
### Author(s):
- Dwight R. Lee
- Daniel Orr
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
A generalized version of the Modigliani-Hohn production smoothing model is analyzed, and two types or classes of theorem are proved. (Theorems 1 and 2): The planning horizon (defined as a minimal interval of sufficient length to yield optimal current decisions) depends critically on the existence of bottleneck conditions; in the case of the original M-H model, a bottleneck arises out of the inventory nonnegativity constraint, and it is here shown that an additional interesting bottleneck condition arises out of an inventory storage capacity constraint. Whether a particular type of bottleneck defines a horizon will depend, interestingly, on the terminal inventory condition that is imposed for the original optimization process. (Theorems 3 and 4): The sensitivity of horizon length to two economic parameters, the discount factor and the marginal storage cost, will depend on whether the horizon-determining bottleneck is due to a binding inventory capacity constraint, or a binding nonnegativity constraint. The capacity constraint will yield perverse horizon sensitivities first noted by Charnes, Dreze and Miller [Charnes, Abraham, Drze, Jaques, Miller, Merton. 1966. Decision and horizon rules for stochastic planning problems: a linear example. Econometrica34 307330.] in their work on the warehousing problem. In light of these results, the importance of horizons as a programming concept can be questioned.

## 5. An Experimental Comparison of the Effectiveness of Three Planning Methods
### Author(s):
- Paul C. Nutt
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
Methods of planning based on systems ideas, behavioral science concepts, and heuristics were used to develop plans in a field setting, to contrast the merits of these planning approaches. Plans were evaluated by experts as well as decision makers and staff in the participating organization. Criteria such as quality, acceptance, and measures of innovation were used to contrast the plans. The perceptions of agency representatives that participated in the planning groups were also obtained.

## 6. A Markovian Model for a Perishable Product Inventory
### Author(s):
- Dan Chazan
- Shmuel Gal
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
The rate of outdating of a perishable product (such as blood) and the age distribution of the inventory are analyzed. It is assumed that after each period's demand, the inventory is replenished with fresh product, up to a constant level. The age distribution is treated as a finite Markov chain. Expected outdating is shown to be convex in the inventory level. Upper and lower bounds for the expected outdating are obtained for the case of general demand distribution. Better and easily computable bounds and approximate distribution are found for the Poisson demand case.

## 7. Optimal Inventories for an (S  1, S) System with No Backorders
### Author(s):
- Stephen A. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of finding optimal stock levels for an inventory system with Poisson demands, arbitrary replacement time distribution, and emergency handling of shortages at a premium cost. The ordering policy is assumed to be of the (S  1, S) type, i.e., a replacement item is ordered as soon as a unit of stock is used. A criterion for selecting the optimal stock level is formulated by minimizing the expected cost per unit time in steady state. Based on the fact that the probability of shortage for this model is given by the Erlang loss formula, it is possible to derive an approximate stocking level formula, which appears to be accurate over a wide range of parameter values. Comparisons with other related models and determination of achieved service levels are also discussed.

## 8. Single Cycle Continuous Review Policies for Arborescent Production/Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
- Leroy B. Schwarz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1977
### Abstract:
In this paper we examine optimal and near-optimal continuous review policies for a deterministic arborescent inventory system: Known and constant outside demand must be met without backlogging or lost sales at minimum average system cost per unit time. Costs are of two types: A fixed order cost at each stage and proportional holding costs on each stage's echelon inventory. We describe some characteristics of optimal policies and, under fairly mild conditions (e.g., zero initial inventory), prove that the optimal stationary policy is a single-cycle policy. We present an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for determining optimal single-cycle policies for arborescent systems. We also examine the near-optimality of system myopic single-cycle policies.
