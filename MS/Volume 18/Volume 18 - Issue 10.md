## 1. Estimating Dynamic Effects of Market Communications Expenditures
### Author(s):
- David B. Montgomery
- Alvin J. Silk
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the problem of measuring market response to a “communications mix”—the various means which a firm employs to transmit sales messages to potential buyers. Distributed lag models are applied to time series data for an ethical drug to estimate the short-run, intermediate, and long-run effects on market share of expenditures made for journal advertising, direct mail advertising, and samples and literature. Important differences were found among the communications variables with respect to the magnitude and over-time pattern of effect each had on market share. Significantly, the results indicate that the average historic allocation of resources to alternative communication vehicles has been in inverse relation to measured market response. A variety of econometric checks on the models lends credibility to the results. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed.

- William A. Wallace
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The problem of allocating construction minerals is rarely considered by those who plan the destiny of our urban environment. The purpose of this research is: (1) to delineate in dollar terms the magnitude of the result of not planning for the consumption of construction minerals, and (2) to develop a computer simulation model which will provide planners with an indication of the effects of decisions. affecting these resources.

## 3. A Markov Decision Model for Selecting Optimal Credit Control Policies
### Author(s):
- Leon H. Liebman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The rapid growth of consumer credit has created a need for improved credit control policies which result in lower total credit costs. This paper investigates one approach for achieving that objective. The credit control problem is formulated as one of developing optimal policies for an infinite horizon Markov decision model. The model utilizes standard financial data; it also requires the measurement of the costs and returns from alternative credit control policies. The Markov model is transformed into an equivalent linear program. A sample problem is solved and the resulting policies analyzed.

## 4. A Scoring Methodology for Assessing the Suitability of Management Science Models
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
In this study, five major criteria (realism, flexibility, capability, ease of use, and cost) for evaluating the suitability of management science models for R&D project selection are established, through personal interviews with R&D administrators and management scientists. A suitability rating system, based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six management science models for their suitability of use in R&D project selection decision making. Profitablility index and scoring types of models were found to have generally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types. The linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility, while the linear, nonlinear and zero-one models had generally higher realism than the other model types.

## 5. Investment-Borrowing Decisions in Natural Gas Transmission
### Author(s):
- Russell G. Thompson
- Michael S. Proctor
- R. R. Hocking
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The investment problem in natural gas transmission in a static sense as analyzed by Chenery [Chenery, H. B. 1949. Engineering production functions. Quart. J. Econ.63(November) 507–531.] and Lehn [Lehn, H. C. 1943. An analysis of gaspipeline economics. Am. Soc. Mech. Engrs. Trans. (July) 445–460.] is reconsidered as a discrete time control problem using a formulation developed by Thompson and George [Thompson, R. G., M. D. George. 1968. Optimal operations and investments of the firm. Management Sci.15(1, September) 49–56.]. In the model, the objective is to maximize, subject to constraints, the terminal value of the investment in transmission pipe and pumping capacity plus the sum of the terminal value of the net savings and the capitalized value of the dividends paid over a decision-making period of fixed length. The state variables are: pumping capacity, indebtedness outstanding, depreciated value of the transmission pipe, depreciated value of the pumping capacity, and savings. The control parameters are: the inside diameter of the transmission pipe (pipe size), the wall thickness of the pipe (thickness), initial pumping capacity, initial borrowings, and initial savings. The control variables are: investments in pumping capacity and borrowings during the period.

## 6. A Model for Aggregate Financial Planning
### Author(s):
- Clement G. Krouse
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
Financial planning in the firm is a dynamic process requiring that a variety of liquidity, profitability, capital structure, growth and stability variables be simultaneously considered. In recent years widespread attention has been given the time-wise interdependencies involved, but the focus has been conceptual and not directed to yield an implementable model. In the present paper a workable, multi-stage planning model is developed by combining these developments in corporate finance with techniques from optimal systems control. The firm is viewed as attempting to optimize a multiple-objective criterion of time-dated variables involving both short-and long-term financial goals. Random elements are considered to be part of the process by which decisions affect the firm's financial state and an optimal decision strategy developed for an important first-approximation model. The paper concentrates on the general model structure and specific means for implementation; rigorous mathematical analysis is suppressed. An illustrative application is presented and potential uses discussed.

## 7. An Optimization Approach to Freight Car Allocation Under Time-Mileage Per Diem Rental Rates
### Author(s):
- William P. Allman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The paper proposes the use of linear programming to “solve” a specific freight car allocation situation wherein a choice of freight cars is available for shipper shipments, and the railroad's car allocation objective is to maximize the expression (freight car rental receivables-freight car rental payables). The freight car rental payment structure which is applicable is that of “time-mileage per diem” rates proposed in the United States by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The paper first describes the problem and its background, and then a model and various extensions are formulated. An example illustrates how costly to a railroad the difference between good and bad car allocation may be. Although the proposed linear programming approach may be manually tractable for small volume car allocation situations, the paper concludes that in most car allocation situations, the approach requires a computerized data base with a “real-time” information and communications system which includes order entry, car rental, routing-distance, and train travel time and yard delay time information.

## 9. Optimal Inventory Policies under a Hierarchy of Setup Costs
### Author(s):
- Donald M. Simmons
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
This paper considers multi-product inventory problems which are subject to an order cost or setup cost hierarchy of the following form: all replenishment orders issued in any given scheduling period are filled in the next period, with the total setup cost of replenishing N different products in one period being S + sN. The values of N observed in the various periods, and therefore the expected setup cost per job, depend on the unknown lot sizes. This type of setup cost dependence can arise in simple inventory problems but is more commonly found in production environments in which the setup cost for a given job depends on the job immediately preceding it in the production schedule. Assuming demands to be random with known probability distributions, an iterative algorithm is presented for computing optimal lot sizes and reorder points for a set of heterogeneous products.

## 10. A Simplified Portrayal for Certain Decision Making Problems
### Author(s):
- Ross H. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The method described here provides a simple portrayal of a decision making sequence, where the decision variable differs from the quantity which varies with uncertainty. The graphical portrayal in three dimensions provides a basis from which conventional dynamic programming concepts can be applied to a class of problems which is difficult to clearly illustrate on a planar graph or decision tree. The analysis procedure is followed through for two practical examples involving decisions between two alternative equipments or plans where lease costs, costs of usage, and penalty costs are involved. The problem is similar to other cost minimization problems encountered in business and industry, and the method can be readily applied with elementary mathematical computations.

## 11. Preface to the Discussion of the ORSA Guidelines
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
The September 1971 issue of Operations Research contains an ORSA committee's report entitled “Guidelines for the Practice of Operations Research.” The issue also contains other material relating to a dispute concerning a specific operations research project. It occurred to me that members of The Institute of Management Sciences might well have an interest, not in the dispute, but in the Guidelines, since these are obviously closely related to the significance of the practice of applied management science. Many of the members of The Institute of Management Sciences over the years have had an intense interest in the meaning of “the scientific method” as it relates to management science, not only in the model building aspects of the science, but in the broader concerns which occur in applications.

## 12. Commentary on ORSA Guidelines
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
Who says a committee can't write a cogent report? Having reread the Guidelines and Appendix I (pp. 1127–1148) several times since publication, I am favorably impressed with the document's perspicacity. I make this statement not only to extend my compliments to the ORSA Ad Hoc Committee for a fine piece of work, but to caution Management Science readers in interpreting the comments to follow. My remarks below are meant to be hopefully helpful suggestions for subsequent versions of the Guidelines. To save space and reading time, I have refrained from explicitly enumerating the very many points in the Guidelines on which I wholeheartedly agree.

## 13. The Myth of Objectivity OR Why Science Needs a New Psychology of Science
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
For the past two years I have been studying a group of over forty eminent physical scientists. I have repeatedly interviewed (there are over 220 hours of tape-recorded interviews) and questioned them about their methodology and attitudes towards science and scientists. The purpose of my study has been to find out how practicing scientists actually do science and what they think about the nature of science.

### Abstract:
(Foreword by Russell L. Ackoff, University of Pennsylvania) A number of my students have had their hackles up ever since the Guidelines appeared. They have been frustrated by their inability to do anything about them. Therefore, when an invitation to contribute to this discussion came to me, I asked them to substitute for me. What they have written is much more provocative and useful than, anything I could have done.

## 15. Reflections on the ORSA Guidelines: A Story, a Poem and a Commentary
### Author(s):
- Paul Peters
- John Nelson
- Chai Kim
- Eugene Rathswohl
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1972
### Abstract:
A story and a poem are presented as vehicles through which to express the authors' impressions of the Guidelines for the practice of operations research issued by the Operations Research Society of America. A commentary on the story and poem is included. This commentary makes the points that the language of the Guidelines is inappropriate to both the practitioner of operations research and his or her client, and that the Guidelines allow and approve of inhumane behavior on the part of a practitioner of operations research. The argument is made that the linguistic problem, if appreciated, can probably be easily rectified. An acceptance of the legitimacy of the second problem, however, is argued to imply a change of attitude.
