## 1. State-Dependent System Residence times for time Shared Queues
### Author(s):
- Stephen R. Kimbleton
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
In this paper we obtain the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the time an arriving customer spends in an FBN queueing system until completion of service at the kth level (1 ≦ k ≦ N) given that at least k levels of service are required. The results are conditioned upon the state of the system at the time of arrival of the customer.

## 2. Some Bounds for Discounted Sequential Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
New bounds are obtained on the optimal return function for what are called discounted sequential decision processes. Such processes are equivalent to ones satisfying the contraction and monotonicity properties (Denardo [Denardo, E. V., 1967. Contraction mappings in the theory underlying dynamic programming. SIAM Review. Vol. 9, pp. 165–177.]). The bounds are useful primarily in the infinite horizon case. Certain subprocesses are exploited, based on the simple notion of taking only those states which are relevant into consideration. Some existing algorithms and some of their obvious extensions are listed. The possibility of identifying nonoptimal decisions, as in MacQueen [MacQueen, J. B., 1966. A Modified dynamic programming method for markovian decision problems. Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications. Vol. 14, pp. 38–43.], is included.

## 3. Deterministic Production Planning with Concave Costs and Capacity Constraints
### Author(s):
- Michael Florian
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
A multi-period single commodity production planning problem is studied in which known requirements have to be satisfied. The model differs from earlier well-known studies involving concave cost functions in the introduction of production capacity constraints. The structure of an optimal solution is characterized and then used in a simple dynamic programming algorithm for problems in which the capacities are the same in every period. Both the nonbacklog and backlog allowed cases are considered.

## 4. Estimating Sample Size in Computing Simulation Experiments
### Author(s):
- George S. Fishman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
A method is described for estimating and collecting the sample size needed to estimate the mean of a process (with a specified level of statistical precision) in a simulation experiment. Steps are also discussed for incorporating the determination and collection of the sample size into a computer library routine that can be called by the ongoing simulation program.

## 5. Economic Order Quantities and Multiple Set-Up Costs
### Author(s):
- Steven A. Lippman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of scheduling the production of a single product at each instant during a time horizon of length T (≦ ∞) so as to minimize the average cost per unit time; backlogging of demand and disposal of stock are not allowed. Two types of costs are incurred; the holding cost per unit time is assumed to be proportional to the inventory level while the ordering cost is that associated with the multiple set-up cost function (see (3) and Figure 1). By studying a special case (K = 0 in (3)) in §2, the analysis of the problem practically becomes that of the standard economic lot size model so that we can rigorously derive some not too widely known results about the lot size model while exploring our model. In particular, we obtain planning horizon theorems and characterize the form of an optimal production schedule for T < ∞ and T = ∞. In §3 the special assumption is removed and similar, but slightly weaker, theorems are established. For example, an optimal production schedule may have several orders of two different sizes in contrast to the special case where every order is the same size. In addition, simple algorithms for finding optimal policies for both T < ∞ and T = ∞ are given.

## 6. Maximal Flow in a Multi-Terminal Network with Any One Arc Subject to Failure
### Author(s):
- Pierre J. Doulliez
- M. R. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
A multi-terminal network consists of several demand nodes connected to a common source node through several intermediate nodes. The requirements at the demand nodes are nondecreasing functions of time. It is required to find the maximum time up to which all demands can be satisfied. In this paper two methods are given for solving the problem when the arc capacities are specified. The same problem is also considered for the case in which any one arc of the network may fail, that is, any one arc may assume a specified lower capacity for that arc. An efficient method for solving this problem is also presented.

## 7. On Time Flow Mechanisms for Discrete System Simulation
### Author(s):
- Richard K. Nance
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
Previous concepts of time flow mechanisms are inadequate for categorizing or describing the algorithms for time flow which may prove most efficient for a particular systems application. The work of Kiviat [6] provides a more meaningful categorization. The patrolling repairman problem serves as an example of the ambiguity and inconsistency in the use of fixed time and next-event classification.

## 8. Extensions of the Group Theoretic Approach in Integer Programming
### Author(s):
- Laurence A. Wolsey
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
By relaxing the nonnegativity constraints on a set of basic variables, an integer programming problem can be reduced to a shortest route problem over a finite Abelian group. Here it is shown how given a similar relaxation on any set of variables, a structurally simpler problem is obtained, which can be regarded as a shortest route problem over an Abelian (but not necessarily finite) group. In particular if the non-negativity constraints are relaxed on all but one of a set of basic variables, a knapsack (or very close to knapsack) problem is obtained, which either gives the solution of the integer problem, or when solved by dynamic programming provides bounds at least as strong as those provided by the above group problem.

## 9. On Elmaghraby's “The Theory of Networks and Management Science”
### Author(s):
- Jin Y. Yen
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
In [Elmaghraby, S. E. 1970. The theory of networks and management science. Management Sci.17(1, September) 1–34.], Elmaghraby presents several network problems. However, many points made in this paper regarding shortest path network problems may be misleading. The purpose of this letter is, on one hand, to examine these points, and, on other hand, to present some additional information on some of the problems being discussed in the original paper for the reader's reference.

## 11. Selective Control of Independent Activities: Linear Programming of Markovian Decisions
### Author(s):
- Hirohide Hinomoto
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
This study is related to optimum control strategies used by a manager supervising a group of independent activities whose performances deteriorate with time. At the end of a day, the manager evaluates information regarding the performance levels of the activities during that day and decides which activity to attend to, since he can control only one at a time. The deterioration of performance and the improvement of the deteriorated performance by a control action from one level to other levels are given by stationary transition probabilities. Optimal strategies for this control are obtained by the linear programming method proposed by Manne [Manne, A. S., Linear programming and sequential decisions. Management Science Vol. 6 No. 1 (April 1960), pp. 259–267.].

## 12. A Note on the Location of Depots
### Author(s):
- Ralph D. Snyder
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
Crow-fly distance between the depot and delivery points is usually used when considering the problem of locating a depot. Instead, we assume that vans can only travel along a rectangular system of roads. This leads us to a much simpler solution.

## 13. Rearranging Matrices to Block-Angular form for Decomposition (And Other) Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Roman L. Weil
- Paul C. Kettler
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
The rows and columns of an arbitrary coefficient matrix of large numerical problems can often be permuted so that substantial time can be saved in computations. For example, if a large linear programming problem has a suitable block-angular structure, one of the time-saving decomposition algorithms can be used. This article presents a systematic method for effecting such a block-angular permutation. An example and the results of manipulations of matrices with more than 300 rows and 2500 columns are shown.

## 14. Communications to the Editor—Some Comments Concerning Revelle, Marks and Liebman's Article on Facility Location
### Author(s):
- Philip D. Robers
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
The recent survey paper entitled “An Analysis of Private and Public Sector Location Models,” by ReVelle, Marks, and Liebman. [Management Science, Vol. 16, No. 11 (July 1970), pp. 692–707] should be of considerable interest to operations research practitioners. To my knowledge it represents the first synthesis of the many results which have been published in the interesting area of facility location. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the article is somewhat misleading in some regards, and may tend to confuse some readers who are not familiar with the literature in this area.

## 15. Communications to the Editor—On Zangwill's Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Convergence
### Author(s):
- Stephen Jacobsen
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
In [Zangwill, W. I. 1969. Convergence conditions for nonlinear programming algorithms. Management Sci.16(1, September).] Zangwill states conditions which are necessary and sufficient for convergence of a nonlinear programming algorithm. However, the conditions offered merely comprise a restatement of Zangwill's definition of convergence, and, as such, their potential usefulness is limited.

## 16. Communications to the Editor—A Communication on Adaptive Smoothing using Evolutionary Spectra
### Author(s):
- Asit Chandmal
- C. Jayaraj
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
In a recent article [Rao, A. G., A. Shapiro. 1970. Adaptive smoothing using evolutionary spectra. Management Sci.17(3) 208–218.] Ambar G. Rao and Arthur Shapiro have proposed a scheme for adaptive smoothing using evolutionary spectra. As the authors admit, this technique demands considerable computer storage and computer time due to the increased number of additions, multiplications and exponentiations when compared to the adaptive smoothing technique proposed by Trigg and Leach [Trigg, D. W., A. G. Leach. 1967. Exponential smoothing with an adaptive response rate. O. R. Quart.18(1) 53–59.].

## 17. Communications to the Editor—A Comment on Location Models
### Author(s):
- Donald M. Deighton
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1971
### Abstract:
In their recent survey of location models, ReVelle et al. [ReVelle, C., D. Marks, J. Liebman. 1970. An analysis of private and public sector location models. Management Sci.10(11, July) 692–707.] touched briefly on the problem of variations over time in the optimum network of facilities: Are locations set in order to be most efficient with todays population, ten years hence or twenty years hence or an average of all three? This question was left unanswered as it is left unanswered elsewhere in the literature on location studies. However, the question is surely answerable, and the purpose of this note is to describe the approach which has been used by the author in answering this question.
