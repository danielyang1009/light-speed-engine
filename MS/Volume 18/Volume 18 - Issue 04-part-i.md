## 1. On the Management of Inquiry
### Author(s):
- Frederick Betz
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
The problem of managing inquiry is a generalization of the more limited problem of managing research and development projects. As management science attends to the complex problem of educational systems or national science systems, then an awareness is worthwhile of other literatures relevant to the problem. This papersuggests that the manager must determine these major relationships:

## 2. The Operation of Academic Departments
### Author(s):
- Walter C. Hobbs
- G. Lester Anderson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
An organizational model of academic departments is developed, showing that departments consist of several coexistent structures. Commonly, curricular decisions are made democratically (i.e., by the “collegium”) and professional matters such as tenure are reserved to the senior ranks (an “oligarchy”). The organizational mode for administrative (i.e., implementive) tasks is a division of labor among peers, which varies from minimal to extensive with the degree to which the departmental members engage in service, teaching and/or research activities requiring coordination.

## 3. Optimal Sorting in Industrial Operations
### Author(s):
- P. Zusman
- W. G. O'Regan
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
A theorem is developed which reduces to manageable proportions a linear programming problem of potentially infinite size. A converging iterative procedure is presented for estimating the parameters to be used in combining the activities of the original large problem. The theorem and iterative procedure are applicable to the general problem of sorting material in industrial processes, whether the material to be sorted consists of peas, pine logs, or poultry products.

## 5. A Branch and Bound Algorithm for Minimizing Cost in Project Scheduling
### Author(s):
- A. Thomas Mason
- Colin L. Moodie
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
This paper presents a “branch and bound” algorithm for the following problem: given a project consisting of a set of activities partially ordered by a set of precedence restrictions, with each activity having a fixed resource requirement over a specified duration, find that set of activity start times which minimizes the combined cost of fluctuations in resource demand and delay of project completion. Cost bounding procedures are augmented by dominance relationships presented as theorems. Initial feasible schedules are generated using a heuristic scheduling rule. Both the heuristic rule and the branch and bound algorithm have been programmed for the computer. Results indicate that while computation time is related to the project network structure, more significant factors are the number of activities and the relative values of the activity parameters, duration and resource requirement. Also, results indicate that the optimal schedule is relatively insensitive to changes in the ratio of the project completion delay cost to the resource level fluctuation cost. Finally, the imposition of an upper limit on resource availability resulted, in most cases, in an increase in the duration and cost of the optimal solution.

## 6. Optimal Defense of Multi-Commodity Networks
### Author(s):
- Mandell Bellmore
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
The determination of an optimal strategy for reinforcing arcs and nodes in a multi-commodity network is discussed. This strategy will maximize the effort required by an attacker to render the network useless. Under certain assumptions this problem is shown to be equivalent to the problem of maximizing the capacity of the minimal multi-commodity disconnecting set for the network. An algorithm for determining an optimal reinforcing strategy under these assumptions is presented, and computational results are discussed.

## 7. A Model for Evaluating VSTOL Versus CTOL Combat Aircraft Systems
### Author(s):
- Seymour Horowitz
- Robert Shishko
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
This paper describes a cost-effectiveness study of the use of vertical or short takeoff and landing (VSTOL) aircraft for combat missions. A comparison is made with conventional (CTOL) aircraft as tactical fighters in a future NATO environment. The conditions under which VSTOL and CTOL aircraft can be considered to be competitive systems are carefully described. A model yielding the “probability of completing n successive missions” is used as a measure of combat effectiveness. A cost model was constructed to reflect the resource impact of the same variables or alternatives that affect the measure of effectiveness. This integrated format is a necessary condition for the selection of least-cost designs capable of providing a given level of mission performance. A graphical summary of such a format is provided.

## 8. Forecasting and Scheduling for Past-Model Replacement Parts
### Author(s):
- John R. Moore, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
All-time requirements forecasting and the translation of these forecasts, via a dynamic inventory model, into production schedules are effective tools for controlling manufacturing, inventory and obsolescence costs of past-model replacement parts. Traditional forecasting rules and steady-state EOQ models prove inappropriate for the special problems posed by the demand decay characteristics of all service parts. A new forecasting technique, based on the principle of estimating sales requirements for all-time into the future, is described along with a dynamic inventory model for ordering production runs. Together, these techniques—developed for implementation by an American auto manufacture—provide results superior to those of other, more traditional, procedures. An inventory review system for achieving model implementation is also discussed.

## 9. A Taylor's Theorem—Central Limit Theorem Approximation: Its Use in Obtaining the Probability Distribution of Long-Range Profit
### Author(s):
- Dennis E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
Although the functional relationship between long-range profit (LRP) and its various components is usually well defined, the difficulty of determining the probability distribution of LRP prevents an immediate answer to a question such as “What are the chances that the LRP associated with decision D will exceed X dollars?” In a situation such as this, the first thought is to use Monte Carlo (i.e., random sampling) in order to provide an approximation to the distribution of LRP. An alternative approach, the use of error propagation formulas based on a Taylor series expansion coupled with a Central Limit Theorem approximation, is discussed.

## 10. Product Design: Subassemblies for Multiple Markets
### Author(s):
- David P. Rutenberg
- Timothy L. Shaftel
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
A firm may cut costs by installing more parts than its products require. Each product or application requires a specified number of parts such as inductors, resistors and capacitors. For assembly and maintenance reasons, parts are grouped into subassembly modules. If there are economies of scale in manufacturing sub-assembly modules, it may be worthwhile to standardize on a few module designs that will be used in all products or applications even though a few more parts than needed are installed. The cost of giving away extra parts by using few standard modules must be balanced against the fixed costs of producing more types of standard modules. In the multi-market problem there is a fixed cost with the production of a module, and then another fixed cost when the module is used in a market. The paper presents a solution procedure and the time results of computer runs for the problem of finding the best standard modules for a multi-product, multi-market corporation.

## 11. Letter to the Editor—Collective Planning, The French Experience
### Author(s):
- Antoine P. Delarue
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1971
### Abstract:
Dr. Branch in [Branch, Melville D., “Delusions and Diffusions of City Planning in the United States,” Management Science, Vol. 16, No. 12 (August 1970).] provided a relatively comprehensive review of city planning in the U.S. Another type of planning not mentioned by Dr. Branch is the “Indicative Planning” which was developed in France. Indicative Planning as a noncoercive but effective approach to national economic planning generated considerable interest. It was thought to provide an answer to the general issue of “Collective Planning” of which city planning and national economic planning are specific examples.

### Abstract:
A process analysis model of the U. S. steel industry recently presented by Tsao and Day [Tsao, C. C., Day, R. H., “A Process Analysis Model of the U. S. Steel Industry,” Management Science, Vol. 17 (June 1971), pp. B-588–B-608.], while accurate in almost every other aspect, is in error in the treatment of coking coal production. This note attempts to remedy this deficiency and presents a corrected matrix for this stage of production.
