## 1. Optimal Time-Cost Trade-Offs in GERT Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
Optimal time-cost trade-offs in deterministic networks of the CPM-type have been neatly resolved by Fulkerson. In the case of GERT-type networks, the problem is complicated by the randomness in the duration of the activity and in the likelihood of its existence. Assuming linear relationships between additional investments and expected duration and additional cost, a model is formulated in which we seek the maximization of the marginal reduction in duration per unit of investment. This, in turn, leads to a fractional linear program whose solution is obtained easily.

## 2. Note—The Stochastic Cash Balance Problem with Charges Levied Against the Balance
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
- Edwin H. Neave
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
The finite horizon cash balance problem with charges levied against the cash balance is considered. Conditions, sufficient to show that a two-sided (s, S) policy is optimal, are given. We consider transactions cost functions which include no fixed costs, and are linear in the amount of change. Only a reinterpretation of an earlier formulation is required when transactions costs are levied against the balance. When penalty charges are so levied, we require the penalty cost function to be convex, non-negative, and include no charge on a zero ending balance.

## 3. Optimal Issuing Policies for Perishable Inventory
### Author(s):
- William P. Pierskalla
- Chris D. Roach
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
Optimal issuing policies for some particular classes of perishable inventory problems are derived under several possible objective functions. The inventory considered is one in which stock is grouped into categories according to shelf age. Demand occurs for each of the categories, and may be satisfied by inventory units from that category or from any “younger” category. It is shown for most of the objective functions considered that the optimal policy is to issue the oldest unit which will satisfy the demand. A prime example of the classes of inventory problems considered in this paper is the issuance of whole blood from a hospital or central blood bank.

## 4. A Note on Verification of Computer Simulation Models
### Author(s):
- Dennis J. Aigner
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
This paper establishes an argument that questions the validity of one “test” of goodness-of-fit for the simulated time path of a single endogenous variable in a simultaneous, perhaps dynamic, econometric model. The test was suggested by Cyert and Cohen, and consists of two parts, within the context of a regression of the actual series on the generated series: a test that the intercept of this regression differs significantly from zero and a test that the slope of this regression differs significantly from one.

## 5. The Gradient Projection Method Along Geodesics
### Author(s):
- David G. Luenberger
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
The method of steepest descent for solving unconstrained minimization problems is well understood. It is known, for instance, that when applied to a smooth objective function f, and converging to a solution point x where the corresponding Hessian matrix F(x) is positive definite, the asymptotic rate of convergence is given by the Kantorovich ratio (β − α)2/(β + α)2, where α and β are respectively the smallest and largest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix F(x). This result is one of the major sharp results on convergence of minimization algorithms.

## 6. A Computer Comparison of Four Quadratic Programming Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Raymond J. Braitsch, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
This paper compares the computational performance of the quadratic programming algorithms of Dantzig, Beale, Wolfe and a modification of Wolfe's algorithm. Problems are generated and solved on the computer with iteration count serving as the principal method of comparison. The effect of certain problem parameters on rate of convergence is considered and computer time and storage requirements of the four algorithms are discussed.

## 7. The Optimality of Generalized (s, S) Policies under Uniform Demand Densities
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
This note considers the single product, single echelon, periodic review, stochastic, dynamic inventory model discussed recently [Porteus, E. L. 1971. On the optimality of generalized (s, S) policies. Management Sci.17 411–426.], where the ordering cost function is concave increasing, rather than simply linear with a setup cost. We show that a generalized (s, S) policy will be optimal in a finite horizon problem when the probability densities of demand are uniform or convolutions of a finite number of uniform and/or one-sided Pólya densities. Such densities are not necessarily one-sided Pólya densities, for which this result has already been established. To prove the result here we need only show, roughly, that a certain subclass of the quasi-K-convex functions is closed under convolution with uniform densities which describe nonnegative random variables.

## 8. A Bayesian Approach to Quality Control
### Author(s):
- Phillip L. Carter
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
The general problem of process control is one of maintaining a production process in such a state that the output from the process conforms to design specifications. As the process operates it will be subject to changes which cause the quality of the output to deteriorate. Some amount of deterioration can be tolerated but at some point it becomes less costly to stop and overhaul the process. The problem of establishing control procedures to minimize long-run expected costs has been approached by several researchers using Bayesian decision theory. However, the models used by these researchers have been incomplete. The purpose of this paper is to extend the Bayesian approach to include consideration of the sample size and the sampling interval in the design of the control procedure. Using dynamic programming the analysis will show how the optimal time between samples and the optimal sample size can be found and how the optimal decision can be made based on the outcome of the sample.

## 9. A Nonlinear Approximation Method for Solving a Generalized Rectangular Distance Weber Problem
### Author(s):
- G. O. Wesolowsky
- R. F. Love
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
This paper provides a method for approximating optimal location in a multi-facility Weber problem where rectangular distances apply. Optimality is achieved when the sum of weighted distances is minimized. Two upper bounds on the error incurred by using the approximation are developed. The formulation can be used in convex programming to solve some nonlinearly constrained problems.

## 10. An Upperbound Algorithm for the Single and Multiple Terminal Delivery Problem
### Author(s):
- Frank A. Tillman
- Thomas M. Cain
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
An upperbound algorithm is presented for solving the multiterminal delivery problem. The method involves determining savings from joining points on routes and making possible assignments as a function of the maximum savings for joining cities on routes. The algorithm permits restrictions to be imposed on the system. If all possibilities are investigated, this approach will lead to an optimal solution using savings as the criterion to be optimized. In practice this may be very time consuming so a limited version is presented where only the most promising nodes are investigated. The methodology developed is applicable to the single terminal problem, since it is a special case of the multiterminal problem.

## 11. The Optimality of Connected Policies for Markovian Systems with Two Types of Service
### Author(s):
- Avraham Beja
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
Consider a single station service system with bounded queue capacity and two possible types of service (“fast” and “slow”), operating in discrete time. It is proved that in the search for an optimal policy one need not consider policies hat prescribe one type of service when the system is relatively empty, another type when there are more customers in the system, and the first type again if there are even more customers in the system.

## 12. Sequential Optimization of Multimodal Discrete Function with Bounded Rate of Change
### Author(s):
- Bruno O. Shubert
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
In this paper a search scheme for finding the maximum of a discrete objective function of several variables is proposed. The scheme is sequential and optimal in the sense that it determines the maximum with minimum number of measurements of the function. Unlike other sequential search techniques with this property the scheme places no condition on the number of possible maxima of the objective function. Instead it requires that some bounds on the rate of change of the function per each variable be known. The points at which measurements of the value of the objective function are to be taken are determined successively by maximization of an auxiliary function updated after each measurement. The algorithm is described in detail, and illustrated by two simple examples.

## 14. Optimal Replacement Policies for a Single Loaded Sliding Standby
### Author(s):
- Claude Henin
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to define an optimal replacement policy for identical components performing different functions in a given system, when one spare part is available. It is assumed that the failure law of the component and of the spare part is known and that the mission of the system has a duration T, that the components cannot be permuted and that the breakage of a given component, i, produces a certain loss Li per unit of time it remains out of use.

## 15. A Comment on a Paper of Maxwell
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey B. Sidney
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1972
### Abstract:
In his paper “On Sequencing n Jobs on One Machine to Minimize the Number of Late Jobs,” [Maxwell, W. L. 1970. On sequencing n jobs on one machine to minimize the number of late jobs. Management Sci.16(5, January).], Maxwell presents an integer programming formulation (which we shall call P) of a one-machine job-shop problem, and attempts to prove the validity of Moore's optimal algorithm [Moore, J. M. 1908. An n job, one machine sequencing algorithm for minimizing the number of late jobs. Management Sci.15(1, September).] by applying cutting plane constraints to the program P. Unfortunately, Maxwell's proof is incorrect. In this brief note, we shall locate Maxwell's error, and present an example, which casts doubt on the possibility of minor modifications being sufficient to correct the proof. We shall adopt much of the notation of Maxwell's paper.

### Author(s):
- J. M. Moore
