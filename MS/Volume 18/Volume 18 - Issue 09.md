## 1. Integer Programming Algorithms: A Framework and State-of-the-Art Survey
### Author(s):
- A. M. Geoffrion
- R. E. Marsten
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
A unifying framework is developed to facilitate the understanding of most known computational approaches to integer programming. A number of currently operational algorithms are related to this framework, and prospects for future progress are assessed.

## 2. Allocating Resources between Research and Development: A Macro Analysis
### Author(s):
- D. P. Gaver
- V. Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
This paper attempts to coordinate at the macro level the research potential and the development capability of an organization in a competitive environment. New product ideas generate from various sources of research which are then processed (preliminary screening, market appraisal, technical development etc.) by the development section. In view of the randomness present in the above process, a backlog of ideas will normally be present awaiting development. The longer the delay in processing them, the greater are the chances of a competitor introducing the product in the meantime.

## 3. More on Min-Max Allocation
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
- Jonathan S. Yormark
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
In a preceding paper Jacobsen [Jacobsen, S. 1971. On marginal allocation in single constraint min-max problems. Management Sci. (July).] shows that marginal allocation solves a class of discrete, single constraint, min-max allocation problems. A dual approach, to this problem is presented, based on a generalization of Jacobsen's P condition, which should prove more efficient when many marginal improvement iterations would be required. A variant of sequential search by bisection is applied, possibly augmented by an accelerated marginal allocation scheme, in which finite convergence to an optimum solution is guaranteed.

## 4. Optimization of Batch Ordering under Deterministic Variable Demand
### Author(s):
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
- Vishwas Y. Bawle
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of the optimal ordering schedule to satisfy a given demand pattern over a finite planning horizon when ordering must be in batches of size Q > 1, with and without “setup” cost. A dynamic programming model is constructed. The number of stages are minimized through the characterization of a “complete” set of periods in which ordering must take place and through consideration of the role of initial inventory. The state space and the decision space at each stage are also minimized through considerations of dominance, bounding and feasibility relative to established properties of the optimal schedule. All this results in a most computational efficient algorithm.

## 5. Variance Minimization in Single Machine Sequencing Problems
### Author(s):
- Alan G. Merten
- Mervin E. Muller
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
The variance of flow-time and variance of waiting-time performance measures are analyzed for the single machine sequencing problem. These measures are compared and contrasted to the performance measures of mean flow-time and mean waiting-time. In particular, while the two mean performance measures attain their minimums at the same job sequence, it is shown that the sequence that minimizes the variance of flow-time is antithetical to the sequence that minimizes the variance of waiting-time. However, the minimum values of the two variance measures are equal. Relationships are also derived for the special problems where either all the job processing-times are equal or all the job weights are equal.

## 6. Assembly Line Balancing using Best Bud Search
### Author(s):
- Arthur J. Nevins
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
A general purpose heuristic program (which has been applied to deductive question-answering and theorem proving) has now been applied to the problem of balancing assembly lines. The results indicate that the program is quite effective in its role as an assembly line balancer.

## 7. Extreme Point Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- M. J. L. Kirby
- H. R. Love
- Kanti Swarup
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
The paper considers a class of optimization problems. The problems are linear programming problems: maximize cx subject to Ax = b with the additional constraint that x must also be an extreme point of a second convex polyhedron Dx = d, x ≧ 0. A cutting-plane algorithm for solving such problems is presented. Two numerical examples are also included.

## 8. Optimal Screening Plans for Nonserial Production Systems
### Author(s):
- Robert R. Britney
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
Quality control screening programs are defined and evaluated for the general n-stage nonserial production process. A total expected cost criterion, developed as a function of the screening applied at each inspection station, embraces the various costs of inspection, defect repair and defects passing through the process undetected. Absorbing Markov chains aid in the identification of probabilistic flows of defective materials through the production network.

## 9. Optimal Control of a Service Facility with Variable Exponential Service Times and Constant Arrival Rate
### Author(s):
- Thomas B. Crabill
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
This paper derives the form of a minimal cost rate stationary operating policy for an M/M/I queueing system with K possible service rates. The two costs of the system are a general cost rate dependent on the state of the system and a cost rate associated with each of the possible service rates. The optimal policy is completely characterized by if K − 1 numbers. The optimal service rate is shown to be nondecreasing in the state of the system.

## 10. Constraint Qualifications Revisited
### Author(s):
- M. S. Bazaraa
- J. J. Goode
- C. M. Shetty
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
In this study we investigate the constraint qualifications for the Kuhn-Tucker conditions to hold for an inequality-constrained nonlinear programming problem. We present the qualifications in a consistent manner so that the interrelationships between them are highlighted. This gives rise naturally to two types of constraint qualifications, and it will be seen that air the qualifications of one type are almost equally weak whereas the other type of qualifications makes relatively strong assumptions. In the study we also slightly relax the Kuhn-Tucker and some other constraint qualifications, and also show the interrelationship between some of the qualifications which have not been established thus far.

## 11. Higher Order Tree Dual Approximation Methods for the Distribution Problem
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
- Darwin Klingman
### Published:
- 1 May 1972
### Abstract:
This paper develops efficient algorithms for obtaining a dual feasible starting basis for the capacitated distribution problem. The motivation for the development of such a technique is threefold. Firstly, although efficient dual methods for solving such problems have been developed, none of these methods have addressed themselves to the problem of efficiently determining a dual feasible starting basis. Secondly, no counterpart method exists for obtaining a primal feasible starting basis for the capacitated problem; furthermore, the development of such a counterpart procedure is unlikely. Finally, because our approach provides a dual feasible basis that is both legitimate (i.e., nonartificial) and good (in terms of the dual functional), the synthesis of our procedure with one of the dual distribution methods should provide a more efficient computational algorithm for solving capacitated distribution problems than primal counterpart methods.
