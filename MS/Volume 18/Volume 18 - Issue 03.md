## 1. Manpower Planning in Hierarchical Organizations: A Computer Simulation Approach
### Author(s):
- Wesley L. Weber
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
A complex system model is presented here as a tool for corporate manpower planning. This approach permits representation of the interrelationships between the behavior of individuals as entities, personnel policy decisions, the labor market, and a large number of individual and organizational outcomes. A computer simulation of the model in the context of a managerial and professional hierarchy is described and tested against hypotheses from the managerial and behavioral science literature. The implications of the results of these tests for the usefulness of this approach for manpower planning and other purposes are discussed.

## 2. Infinite-Horizon Optimality in an Equipment Replacement and Capacity Expansion Model
### Author(s):
- David S. P. Hopkins
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
The problem faced by a single-product firm that must choose among alternative investments in capital equipment to meet a known demand for capacity in each discrete time period is formulated as a linear program. The formulation explicitly includes a transient set of investment opportunities which are available in early periods, as well as a stationary set which will become available in the near future. Also, no finite time horizon is placed upon the planning process. The approach taken to obtain the optimal solution to the infinite-horizon problem is to solve first a finite-horizon problem that includes a valuation of terminal capital stocks. The optimal solution to this problem is then used to construct a solution to the infinite-horizon problem that is identical to the finite-horizon solution in early periods. This construction is shown to be optimal for the infinite-horizon problem.

## 3. Infinite Horizon Programs
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
Several difficulties arise when multistage optimization problems with linear constraints are extended to an infinite horizon. For linear objectives the weak duality theorem fails, duality gaps exist, complementary slackness is not a sufficient condition for optimality, and the total reward may diverge.

## 4. Bond Refunding with Stochastic Interest Rates
### Author(s):
- Basil A. Kalymon
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
The bond refunding problem is formulated as a multiperiod decision process in which future interest rates are determined by a Markovian stochastic process. It is assumed that a single bond is to be outstanding at a given time. Given the future requirements for debt financing, the decision maker must decide whether to keep his current bond or to refund by issuing a new bond at the current market interest rates. Over a finite planning horizon, the structure of policies which minimize expected total discounted costs is studied.

## 5. An Implicit Enumeration Algorithm for the Concave Cost Network Flow Problem
### Author(s):
- M. Florian
- P. Robillard
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
The objective of this paper is the construction of a branch-and-bound algorithm for computing minimum cost flows in capacitated networks when the cost of passing a flow over an are is concave. The method is based on the equivalence of the general network flow problem to a network flow problem in a bipartite network of a special form. An optimal flow is found by implicit enumeration of the set of extremal flows in that network.

## 6. Set Covering and Involutory Bases
### Author(s):
- Mandell Bellmore
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
Some new properties associated with the special class of integer programs known as weighted set covering problems are derived. While it is well known that an optimal integer solution to the set covering problem is a basic feasible solution to the corresponding linear program, we show that there exists an optimal basis which is involutory (i.e., B = Bâˆ’1).

## 7. Conditional Monte Carlo: A Simulation Technique for Stochastic Network Analysis
### Author(s):
- John M. Burt, Jr.
- Mark B. Garman
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with a simulation procedure for estimating the distribution functions of the time to complete stochastic networks. The procedure, called conditional Monte Carlo, is shown to be substantially more efficient (in terms of the computational effort required) than traditional simulation methods. The efficacy of conditional Monte Carlo and its use in conjunction with other Monte Carlo methods is illustrated for the Wheatstone bridge network. The applicability of the procedure to larger networks, as well as other stochastic systems, is discussed, and a general method is given for its implementation.

## 8. Risk Aversion in Chance Constrained Portfolio Selection
### Author(s):
- David H. Pyle
- Stephen J. Turnovsky
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1971
### Abstract:
In this paper, we discuss the effects of changes in investable wealth on investment behavior when portfolio choices are subject to a chance constraint. Alternative specifications of the chance constraint are shown to imply increasing, decreasing, or constant relative risk aversion with respect to changes in wealth.
