### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
This paper describes the use of multiple ranking procedures to analyze data generated from computer simulation experiments with models of management systems. After outlining the rationale for the use of multiple ranking procedures with computer simulation experiments and defining some basic terminology, we examine several specific multiple ranking procedures. Careful attention is given to the assumptions underlying the different multiple ranking procedures and the extent to which these assumptions are satisfied by the data generated by simulation experiments. An example model is included to illustrate the applicability of multiple ranking procedures to simulation experiments in management science.

## 2. A Goal Programming Approach to Urban-Suburban Location Preferences

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
Recent efforts in the area of modelling activities in the urban environment have been concentrated on the use of simulation techniques. In this paper the problem of population location in a metropolitan area is treated in an analytic model employing a goal programming formulation. A target population is broken into groups which then compete for a share of limited capacity in a number of urban sectors. The possible usefulness of this approach to urban planning, real estate development, and transportation systems design is illustrated through the theoretical development and the presentation of a numerical model.

## 3. A Decision and Value Approach to Research Personnel Allocation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
A problem which exists in a large research laboratory is the allocation of professional people to work on research projects. Each department manager must allocate his personnel so that effectiveness, value of a given man to a given project, is maximized. Computationally, the transportation technique may be used to solve the problem if it is possible to determine the individual coefficients (or effectiveness values) giving the relative value of the ith man to the jth project, for all i, j. This paper describes a technique for determining these effectiveness values. The effectiveness values are subjective, and reflect the value judgments of the department manager and of those who assign projects. The philosophy used in producing the effectiveness values is to simplify the manager's decisionmaking task in expressing his value judgments to comparing only two alternatives with respect to a single criterion at one time. The results of the ratings taken are reduced to produce a set of normalized effectiveness values. The use of the technique in a model allocation problem is shown. The application of the technique need not be confined to a personnel allocation problem, but can be applied to any resource allocation problem where the objective is to optimize a subjective measure.

## 4. Computer-Assisted School Bus Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
This paper reports on an application of computer technology to a significant and costly school administration problem: the transportation of students between home and school. The problem, as it is generally thought of, has been complicated by the consideration of attempting racial balance via busing. We present an algorithm to find a feasible solution which tends to minimize the number of required routes and mileage. After setting down the basic approach used and the results of an application, we will present possible extensions of the approach to school location planning, bus fleets composition and timing conditions on particular bus stops.

## 5. Dispatching and Allocating Servers to Stochastically Failing Networks
### Author(s):
- Michael Moses
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
The problem considered is that of allocating and dispatching servers to networks whose nodes and/or arcs fail stochastically. A mathematical programming formulation is developed which allocates servers to nodal demands so that expected loss is minimized. From this a zero-one programming problem is formulated to insure whole server allocation and to allow for decreasing service time and cost functions in the number of servers dispatched to a demand. Comparative computer experience with two zero-one codes is reported. Server transfers between subparts of networks, use of the model for prepositioning servers throughout the network and other extensions are discussed in the final section.

## 6. On the N-Job One-Machine, Sequence-Independent Scheduling Problem with Tardiness Penalties: A Branch-Bound Solution
### Author(s):
- Joel Shwimer
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
An efficient branch-bound algorithm is presented for solving the n-job, sequence-independent, single machine scheduling problem where the goal is to minimize the total penalty costs resulting from tardiness of jobs. The algorithm and computational results are given for the case of linear penalty functions. The modifications needed to handle the case of nonlinear penalty functions are also presented.

## 8. A Balasian-Based Algorithm for Zero-One Polynomial Programming
### Author(s):
- Hamdy A. Taha
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
A new algorithm is developed for solving zero-one polynomial problems. The algorithm is a direct extension of the well-known Balasian algorithm for zero-one linear programs. The basic idea underlying the development is that every zero-one polynomial programming problem can be converted into an equivalent zero-one linear system with nonlinear secondary constraints representing the polynomial terms. Moreover, the optimal solution to the original polynomial problem must be a feasible solution to the converted linear problem. Thus, the optimal solution is determined by searching for the best solution among the feasible solutions to the linear problem such that the secondary constraints are satisfied. The important point is that the secondary constraints are considered implicitly so that the size of the problem is determined by its equivalent linear form. Computational experience indicates that the new algorithm compares favorably with the existing ones due to Lawler and Bell [Lawler, E., M. Bell. 1967. A method for solving discrete optimization problems. Oper. Res.15 1098–1112.] and to Watters [Watters, L. J. 1967. Reduction of integer polynomial problems to zero-one linear programming problems. Oper. Res.15 1171–1174.]. The application of the algorithm to a special class of nonlinear binary problems is also investigated.

## 9. On the Evaluation of Shortage Costs for Inventory Control of Finished Goods
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1972
### Abstract:
This paper summarizes work performed in evaluating shortage costs associated with stockouts for each of a manufacturer's seven thousand catalogued line items. A modified version of a decision tree model proposed by Yu Chang is employed in a determination of estimated unit shortage costs for a stratified random sample of items. The data required by this model for describing customer behavior were obtained via direct interviews and an extensive mail survey, while the remaining data were extracted from records of the manufacturer. The results are extended to all items on the basis of an excellent correlation between, the evaluated unit shortage costs and unit gross profits of the items in the sample.

### Abstract:
In the column generating approach to concave programming, alias the dual cutting-plane algorithm (Zangwill), Lagrangians are maximized to generate columns. Often this cannot be done in a finite number of steps. We show what to do.
