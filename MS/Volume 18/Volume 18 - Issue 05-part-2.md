## 1. Introduction to a Dedicated Issue on Game Theory and Gaming
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
The emphasis in this issue has been on game theory with six papers on game theory, one on gaming, and one relating game theory to gaming. Collectively, the first three papers present an overview of the subject area. The remaining five papers report on new research.

## 2. An Overview of the Mathematical Theory of Games
### Author(s):
- William F. Lucas
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
A cursory survey of the theory of games is presented. The basic models for games in extensive form, normal form, and characteristic function form are discussed, and some generalizations and extensions of these models are mentioned briefly. Some general remarks about the applicability of the theory are made in §2, and a few-specific applications are referred to in sections subsequent to the description of the particular models. Mention is made throughout this paper to the other game theoretic articles in this issue in an attempt to place them somewhat within this outline of the subject.

## 3. On the Scope of Gaming
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
Gaining and simulation mean different things to different people. Currently there exist separate schools of individuals working on interrelated but basically different areas. Each has its own special goals and terminology. Yet there is a sufficient overlap among them that it is important to clarify the common and different interests and terminology.

## 4. On Gaming and Game Theory
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
Gaming and game theory are two extremely different yet highly related disciplines. It is of considerable use to a practitioner of either of these disciplines that he be aware of the relationship of one to the other. This paper attempts to provide a sketch of game theory for those whose prime concern is gaming.

## 5. Some Thoughts on the Minimax Principle
### Author(s):
- R. J. Aumann
- M. Maschler
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
It is generally agreed that the minimax solution to a two-person zero-sum matrix game is intuitively satisfactory. Now in many applications of game theory, a game is not described a priori in matrix (or “normal” or “strategic”) form, but rather in extensive form, i.e., by its rules. A game described in such a way may be reduced to a matrix game by means of the concept of “strategy.” If, moreover, it is of perfect recall, then all mixed strategies, and in particular the optimal strategies of each player, are equivalent to behavior strategies. The usual conclusion from these considerations is that for 2-person 0-sum games in extensive form, the minimax solution is intuitively satisfactory; and that in games of perfect recall, in particular, the players would do well to play in accordance with optimal (minimax) behavior strategies. In this paper we shall discuss some examples that, we believe, cast doubt on these conclusions.

## 6. Multilinear Extensions of Games
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Owen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
The multilinear extension of an n-person game v is a function defined on the n-cube IN which is linear in each variable and which coincides with v at the conrners of the cube, satisfying f(x) = v({i ∣ xi = 1}). Multilinear extensions are useful as a help in computing the values of large games, and give a generalization of the Shapley value.

## 7. A Generalized Nash Solution for Two-Person Bargaining Games with Incomplete Information
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
- Reinhard Selten
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
The paper extends Nash's theory of two-person bargaining games with fixed threats to bargaining situations with incomplete information. After defining such bargaining situations, a formal bargaining model (bargaining game) will be proposed for them. This bargaining game, regarded as noncooperative game, will be analyzed in terms of a certain class of equilibrium points with special stability properties, to be called “strict” equilibrium points. Finally an axiomatic theory will be developed in order to select a unique solution from the set X of payoff vectors corresponding to such strict equilibrium points (as well as to probability mixtures of the latter). It will be shown that the solution satisfying the axioms proposed in this paper is the point where a certain generalized Nash product is maximized over this set X.

## 9. A Quasi-Game Theory Approach to Pricing
### Author(s):
- Ambar G. Rao
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
A quasi-game theory approach to market-entry pricing is taken for a product class where price is the only indicator of quality. The model is based on certain hypotheses regarding individual customer behavior, which is then aggregated to find demand for a product given its price. Using game theoretic thinking and assumptions about brand behavior, optimal pricing policies are derived.
