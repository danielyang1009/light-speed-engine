## 1. Management Science and Management: Implementing Management Science Via Situational Normativism
### Author(s):
- Melvin F. Shakun
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
Implementation of management science via situational normativism, a descriptive-normative approach to decision making, is discussed. The situational normativism process involves a search by manager and management scientist for a synthesized situational frame of understanding (involving analytic and heuristic knowledge, as discussed in the paper) within which solutions to the decision situation problem can be found. Implementation constraints (e.g., cognitive style constraints and political constraints) are explicitly considered. A situational normativism organization development concept is suggested. Mutual understanding between scientist and manager evolves from and is fed to the situational normativism search process. Unity of science and management, implementation, and organization (system) development—in the sense of attaining evolved-in-the-process goals—are viewed as natural corollaries of working towards a synthesized situational frame of understanding via situational normativism. Some examples illustrating aspects of the organization development concept arising from practice are presented.

## 2. Models for the Minimum Cost Development of Offshore Oil Fields
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
Since the cost of developing a single offshore oil field usually runs in the tens of millions of dollars, savings due to better development policies could be quite significant. This paper presents a general model for developing offshore fields at minimum cost. The model applies to any field developed from fixed platforms, and thus could also be used directly for the development of fields on the north slope of Alaska. The basic limitations and possible utility of the model are discussed. The mathematical programming formulation of the problem is shown to be identical in general structure to the well-known warehouse location problem. Algorithms for solving the problem are developed, whereby the algorithm for a particular problem will depend upon the general form of the platform cost function. The algorithms developed are tested and shown to be computationally practical.

## 3. Inventory Systems with Imperfect Asset Information
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Iglehart
- Richard C. Morey
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
An inventory stock record is in error when the stock record is not in agreement with the physical stock. Such discrepancies may be introduced due to time lags between flow of information and material, pilferage, incorrect unit of issue, inaccurate physical inventory counts, etc. The primary impact of these errors is that the system fails to order when it should, resulting in “warehouse denials,” i.e., the stock records show a balance sufficient to issue a given material release order, but for which insufficient units of stock can physically be found.

## 4. A Goal Programming Model for Academic Resource Allocation
### Author(s):
- Sang M. Lee
- Edward R. Clayton
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
The rapid rate of technological development and the growing complexity of society in recent years have brought renewed awareness of the importance of higher education. The rapid expansion of higher education, both in size and quality, requires systematic approaches and dynamic planning for efficient resource allocation on the part of the university administrators. This paper presents a goal programming model for an optimum allocation of resources in an institution of higher learning.

## 5. Earnings Estimates and the Accuracy of Expectational Data
### Author(s):
- Edwin J. Elton
- Martin J. Gruber
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
This paper examines the accuracy of forecasts produced by mechanical forecasting techniques and three groups of analysts. The nine mechanical forecasting techniques are variations of exponentially weighted moving averages, naive models, simple moving averages, and regressions. One-, two- and three-year forecasts are used to evaluate these techniques.

## 6. The Distribution System Simulator

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
The Distribution System Simulator (DSS) is a software system designed to overcome the difficulties inherent in the construction and use of simulation models for large-scale, physical distribution systems. The central difficulties associated with the simulation of a distribution system are: (1) defining a suitable model, (2) programming the model for a computer, (3) obtaining appropriately indicative output reports from the distribution simulation, (4) ordering the model repetitively to respond to the implications of the output reports so that the practical consequences of theoretical changes can be determined. The Distribution Systems Simulator provides a means for accomplishing these ends without programming effort on the part of the user.

## 7. On the Social Psychology of the Safety Factor: A Case Study in the Sociology of Engineering Science
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
Selected aspects of a heuristic programming study of the design behavior of a practicing mechanical engineer are described. The study documents the tremendous influence that personality and social variables exert on the technical practice of engineering design. The study bears testimony to Churchman's inseparability thesis [Churchman, C. W. 1968. Challenge to Reason. McGraw-Hill, New York.], i.e., that without our developing some sophisticated notion of what the “system” as a whole is like, the components or subsystems of a system can only be identified and studied with difficulty. The conclusion of the study is that, contrary to most theories of the engineering design process, the behavioral and technical aspects of design are highly inseparable. In certain instances, the influence of behavioral factors on design outweighs the technical factors.

## 8. A Direct Approach to Choice under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Morton I. Kamien
- Nancy L. Schwartz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
In a problem of decision making under uncertainty, the payoff is random, obeying some probability distribution. The distribution depends upon both the problem faced and the action taken by the decision maker. For example, in the selection of a portfolio, funds are allocated among securities, each of which has an associated distribution over the return it yields. The allocation results in a composite probability distribution over the total return from the entire portfolio.

## 9. A Note on the Centre of Gravity in Depot Location
### Author(s):
- C. D. T. Watson-Gandy
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1972
### Abstract:
This note reports some experiments relating to the centre of gravity in distribution problems. It is shown that under certain conditions very substantial errors can be incurred if the centre of gravity is used as the depot location instead of other measures.
