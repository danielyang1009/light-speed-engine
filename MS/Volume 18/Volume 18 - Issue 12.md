## 1. The Carolina Population Center Family Planning Administrator Training Game
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
This role-playing game for family planning administrators is a technique for the learning of effective planning and rational allocation of economic resources of population control programs. Through the use of electronic data processing, the game provides valuable experience in the sort of decision making that public health officials seldom encounter before going into the field. The game simulates an environment in which the family planning administrator' must make his allocation decisions and from which he receives feedback in the form of demographic results. The game may be made to react to simulate a particular country if the game leader has access to the relevant data, thus providing preparation for decisions in the field.

## 2. Portfolio Performance and the Investment Horizon
### Author(s):
- Haim Levy
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
Following the equilibrium model which has been developed by Sharpe, Lintner and Treynor, several authors have developed one-parameter indexes as measures of performance. In this paper, it is shown that as long as the “true” horizon does not coincide with the horizon assumed in the empirical research, the one-parameter indexes contain a systematic bias, even when one assumes a perfect market.

## 3. The Resolution of Investment Uncertainty Through Time
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
Investments in operating assets with identical expected discounted return and identical risk characteristics (i.e., variances and higher moments) when measured at the outset may have significantly different patterns of uncertainty resolution over their lives. The concept of uncertainty resolution, although ambiguous, is a potentially important characteristic of an investment alternative. This paper explores the usefulness and limitations of the concept of uncertainty resolution in the evaluation of both single risky investments and in portfolios of risky investments. In cases where future investment opportunities are completely known the concept does not seem useful; however, in a more realistic setting where future investment alternatives are ill defined at present, the concept may prove useful. Further research is needed to explore fully the questions raised here.

## 4. Reward Functions to Reinforce a Goal-Based Management Process
### Author(s):
- Donald H. Peters
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
A mathematical model for an incentive system is presented for use within an organization which has a single criterion measure and which sets goals for performance in advance. This model is examined and assumptions stated concerning what restrictions are necessary to reinforce “desired” behavior. With this general model a series of specific examples is derived and evaluated. The implementation of the most obviously practicable example is discussed. Directions for research with such incentives are suggested.

## 5. A Recursive Optimization and Simulation Approach to Analysis with an Application to Transportation Systems
### Author(s):
- Richard L. Nolan
- Michael G. Sovereign
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
Modeling large systems with either an optimization or a simulation method has several disadvantages. Simulation is usually expensive if adequate detail and experimental designs are employed. Complete detail in optimization models may press the bounds of computability. A recursive approach integrating both types of models is presented.

## 6. Some Manpower Planning Models Based on Levels of Educational Attainment
### Author(s):
- Warren Balinsky
- Arnold Reisman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
A number of manpower planning models are developed and optimized. The models are dynamic feed forward models and treat people as the only flow variable. The flow originates by considering a particular population of eligible persons and then traces them through the educational and economic sectors of the model. The flow is driven by selecting the optimal number of entrants into the educational (training) program each period. The objective function is composed of educational and manpower “inventory” costs. The manpower costs are for having an undersupply or oversupply of trained manpower and can be related to unemployment, educational or other societal costs.

## 7. Decision Modeling in Case Selection for Medical Utilization Review
### Author(s):
- John O. McClain
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
A situation is described in which large amounts of physician time are being spent reviewing patient records. In order to promote efficient use of their time, careful selection of the cases they review is called for. A methodology is developed to elicit criteria from physicians for the use of nonphysicians in case selection. The methodology, called the direct approach to approximate decision models, involves the use of interviews and questionnaires asking the physician directly about the criteria he uses, rather than inferring his criteria by indirect means. He is asked to interpret these criteria in a way that will allow a nonphysician to use them for case selection so that the resulting model is an approximation to the physician's decision process.

## 8. An Efficient Branch and Bound Algorithm for the Warehouse Location Problem
### Author(s):
- Basheer M. Khumawala
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
This paper introduces an efficient branch and bound algorithm for a special class of mixed integer programming problems called the warehouse location problem. A set of branching decision rules is proposed for selecting warehouses to be constrained open and closed from any node of the branch and bound tree. These rules are tested for their efficiency in reducing computation times and storage requirements to reach optimal solutions. An improved method of solving the linear programming problems at the nodes which substantially reduces the computations is also introduced in this paper.

## 9. Comments on “Economic Ordering Frequency for Two Items Jointly Replenished” by Frank T. Shu
### Author(s):
- Amarlal H. Kalro
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
In his paper (Management Science, Vol. 17, No. 6, pp. B-406–B-410) Shu describes a method for determining the replenishment frequencies of items jointly replenished. Essentially, the procedure develops “skipping rules” for an item, this being replenished every kth time that the others are replenished. A better procedure is to rank the items in decreasing order of demand/set-up cost ratio, then select the lowest ratio item as the skipped item.

## 10. A Comparison between Two Kinds of Decentralized Optimality Conditions in Nonconvex Programming
### Author(s):
- A. Ten Kate
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
Decomposable mathematical programming problems sometimes admit a certain degree of decentralization in the decision process. By an informative interplay between a central authority and a number of subdivisions one hopes to establish the overall best solution. This interplay can be organized in either of two ways: direct or indirect distribution. However, an absolute prerequisite for such procedures to be successful is the availability of an optimality criterion to the centre so as to know when to stop the iterative process. It is well known that for either of two cases the optimality conditions as derived from the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the overall problem are not satisfactory. The present paper makes a comparison between the shortcomings of the two kinds of conditions. In the case of direct distribution this condition turns out to be necessary but unfortunately not sufficient and for indirect distribution the condition is sufficient but not necessary. The insufficiency in the direct and the absence of necessity in the indirect case, which are caused by eventual nonconvexities of the problem, are explored a bit further. A simple example is presented.

## 11. Notes—An Index of Health: An Application in Accidents
### Author(s):
- John Morton Krall
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1972
### Abstract:
This paper presents an index of health which is based on a multiple decrement model. The index is denned in terms of costs and benefits which are weighted sums of losses and gains experienced in a population due to poor or good health. The index of health is then applied to a farm accident problem. The purpose of the index is to serve as an aid to administrators in making decisions concerning which types of accidents should receive larger resource allocations in the effort toward elimination.
