## 1. A Sequential Stochastic Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
Suppose there are n men available to perform n jobs. The n jobs occur in sequential order with the value of each job being a random variable X. Associated with each man is a probability p. If a “p” man is assigned to an “X = x” job, the (expected) reward is assumed to be given by px. After a man is assigned to a job, he is unavailable for future assignments. The paper is concerned with the optimal assignment of the n men to the n jobs, so as to maximize the total expected reward. The optimal policy is characterized, and a recursive equation is presented for obtaining the necessary constants of this optimal policy.

## 2. Risk-Sensitive Markov Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Ronald A. Howard
- James E. Matheson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
This paper considers the maximization of certain equivalent reward generated by a Markov decision process with constant risk sensitivity. First, value iteration is used to optimize possibly time-varying processes of finite duration. Then a policy iteration procedure is developed to find the stationary policy with highest certain equivalent gain for the infinite duration case. A simple example demonstrates both procedures.

## 3. Multiproduct Production Scheduling for Style Goods with Limited Capacity, Forecast Revisions and Terminal Delivery
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
- Rein Peterson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
A general mathematical model is formulated for the problem of scheduling production quantities for a group of products with seasonal stochastic demand through a common production facility. It is assumed that revised forecasts of total demand over the season for each product become available as the season progresses; delivery is not required until the end of the selling season. Limited production capacity requires that some production take place early in the season, when forecasts are less accurate. At the end of the season, there are overage costs and underage costs representing costs of producing excess quantities and opportunity costs of not producing enough units. Under certain assumptions concerning the data-generating process for forecast revisions, it is possible to formulate the entire problem as a dynamic programming problem; however, the formulation is not computationally feasible if two or more products are considered. Three heuristic approaches to the multi-product problem are presented, and their cost performance is evaluated in some numerical examples. In these particular examples, more frequent reforecasting and rescheduling produces substantial reduction in costs.

## 5. Note—On the Sequencing of n Jobs on One Machine to Minimize the Number of Jobs Late
### Author(s):
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
In a recent paper [Moore, J. M. 1968. An n job, one machine sequencing algorithm for minimizing the number of late jobs. Management Sci.15(1, September).] Moore addressed himself to the problem of the title, and devised a rather simple algorithm for its solution. He also mentions a somewhat simpler algorithm suggested by Hodgson. The proof of both algorithms is rather involved. The following is a more direct, and hopefully simpler, proof.

## 6. The Labor Assignment Decision and Application of Work Flow Structure Information
### Author(s):
- William K. Holstein
- William L. Berry
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
The movement of workers among machines is a tactic often employed by job shop managers to break bottlenecks and smooth the flow of work. Despite its common occurrence in industrial practice, the problem has only recently received attention in the management science literature.

## 7. A Procedure for Computing the K Best Solutions to Discrete Optimization Problems and Its Application to the Shortest Path Problem
### Author(s):
- Eugene L. Lawler
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
A general procedure is presented for computing the best, 2nd best,…, Kth best solutions to a given discrete optimization problem. If the number of computational steps required to find an optimal solution to a problem with n(0, 1) variables is c(n), then the amount of computation required to obtain the if best solutions is O(Knc(n)).

### Abstract:
The multiparametric linear programming (MLP) problem for the right-hand sides (RHS) is to maximize z = cTx subject to Ax = b(λ), x ≧ 0, where b(λ) be expressed in the form
where F is a matrix of constant coefficients, and λ is a vector-parameter.

## 9. Redundant Constraints and Extraneous Variables in Integer Programs
### Author(s):
- David S. Rubin
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
Integer programs may have constraints which are redundant or else nonbinding. They may also have variables which are extraneous in the sense that there is some optimal program in which they are nonpositive. Thompson, Tonge and Zionts [Thompson, G. L., F. M. Tonge, S. Zionts. 1966. Techniques for removing nonbinding constraints and extraneous variables from linear programming problems. Management Sci.12(7, March) 588–608.] have discussed the topics of redundant constraints and extraneous variables in linear programs. This paper extends their results to integer programs, and provides new proofs of the original results.

## 10. On the Loading Problem—A Comment
### Author(s):
- Benjamin Lev
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
Eilon and Christofides (E & C), in their paper on “The Loading Problem” [Eilon, S., N. Christofides. 1971. The loading problem. Management Sci.17(5, January) 259–268.], suggest a solution using a heuristic algorithm. In this note we would like to present a simpler heuristic algorithm which is easier to solve, has less computations and reaches an optimal solution as often as E & C's reaches in the same number of cases.

### Abstract:
Lev's claim [Lev, B. 1972. On the loading problem—A comment. Management Sci.18(7) 428–431.] that his modification to the E & C heuristic (as he calls it) is a significant improvement is highly exaggerated.

## 12. Customers' Optimal Joining Rules for the GI/M/s Queue
### Author(s):
- Uri Yechiali
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
A GI/M/s queue with a stationary balking sequence is considered. For the infinite horizon average reward criterion, it is shown that among all stationary joining policies the optimal ones are nonrandomized control limit rules of the form: join if and only if the queue size is smaller than some specific number. It is shown that, in general, exercising self-optimization by individual customers does not optimize public good. The M/M/s queue is then treated as an example, and a “direct” proof for the optimality of the control limit rule is given.

## 13. Insurance Contracts, As Two-Person Games
### Author(s):
- Robert B. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
In this paper, the problem of completing a contract between a buyer and a seller of insurance is presented as a two-person, zero-sum game, and previous results concerning optimal insurance contracts are reviewed from the viewpoint of game theory. While this point of view seems unrealistic, it is seen to lead to theorems which involve contracts actually encountered in the real world. It is shown that an insurance agreement which splits each loss proportionately between the insurer and the insured is optimal from the viewpoint of a risk averting insurance company that seeks to maximize its expected utility when the net insurance premium is fixed.

## 14. Computing Equilibria of Two-Person Games from the Extensive Form
### Author(s):
- Robert Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1972
### Abstract:
The Lemke-Howson algorithm for computing equilibria of finite 2-person non-cooperative games in normal form is modified to restrict the computations to the ordinarily small portion corresponding to the strategies actually used by the players, and further it is shown that in games with perfect recall these strategies can be generated as needed from an auxiliary analysis of the players' decision trees derived from the extensive form of the game.
