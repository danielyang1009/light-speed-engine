## 1. Mean-Absolute-Deviation Characteristic Lines for Securities and Portfolios
### Author(s):
- William F. Sharpe
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
The characteristic line of a security or portfolio relates its rate of return to that of a “market portfolio.” Several investigators have suggested the desirability of obtaining such a line by minimizing the sum of the absolute deviations rather than the sum of the squared deviations around the line. This paper presents a new algorithm for such a regression problem. The procedure has at least two virtues: it is simple, and it produces useful information as a byproduct of the solution process. Empirical evidence is also presented on the differences in the values obtained with the two regression methods (i.e., mean-absolute-deviation and least-squares). The differences appear to be relatively slight, at least for well-diversified portfolios.

## 3. The Economics of Manpower Pooling
### Author(s):
- David W. Conrath
- William F. Hamilton
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
Formal manpower planning has received increasing attention in recent years. This paper considers the problem of establishing a manpower policy for defined skill categories in the face of uncertain demands. At one extreme an organization might hire and fire personnel as the demand for their services varies over time. Alternatively, the work force might be held constant at a predetermined level and supplemented with overtime or subcontracting when manpower demand exceeds the supply. Models representing these two strategies are developed and compared. Examples are presented to illustrate their economic implications, and several simple rules of thumb are derived to guide manpower policy decisions.

## 4. The Crop Planning Decision Problem: A Comment
### Author(s):
- Christian T. L. Janssen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
In the October 1969 issue of Management Science, Professor Warren Hausman presented a framework for analysis of sequential decision problems of a recurring nature (“Sequential Decision Problems: A Model to Exploit Existing Forecasters,” pp. B93-B111). His system consists of a dynamic programming decision model based upon successively revised forecasts of a key unknown variable and on the probability distribution of forecast changes. The decision system is illustrated with an application to a specific crop planning problem faced by a vegetable processor. We focus, in this comment, on the specific crop supply problem used by Hausman to illustrate the applicability of his general framework.

## 5. Axiomatic Characterization of the Time-Weighted Rate of Return
### Author(s):
- Kenneth B. Gray, Jr.
- Robert B. K. Dewar
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
In a recently published banking industry study [Fisher, Lawrence. 1968. Measuring rates of return. Chapter 2 in James H. Lorie et al., Measuring the Investment Performance of Pension Funds for the Purpose of Inter-Fund Comparison, Bank Administration Institute, Park Ridge, Illinois.], it was pointed out that the venerable internal rate of return is inappropriate for measuring the performance of pension fund managers. It is suggested that a measure of management performance should depend solely on the way in which the manager proportions the fund's resources and not on fund contributions and withdrawals. Unfortunately, the internal rate depends on this contribution and withdrawal pattern.

## 6. Cargo Vehicle Productivity
### Author(s):
- Robert McQuie
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model of the operation of any size or type of cargo vehicle. Twenty-eight operating and design characteristics are represented permitting their impact on steady state productivity to be estimated. This tool enables one to make a quick but detailed comparison of competing vehicles by manual means. It reduces the need of employing a computer, and should be of use to management concerned with new methods of cargo movement and with vehicle procurement.

## 7. The Role of Decision Models in the Evaluation of Competing Environmental Health Alternatives
### Author(s):
- Albert J. Klee
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
This paper discusses the problems faced by the Solid Waste Management Office (formerly the Bureau of Solid Waste Management) in evaluating competing environmental health alternatives, given a set of decision criteria. The concepts of scoring models are reviewed. Techniques for the implementation of a linear scoring model are critically examined; and a new method, termed DARE, is discussed as it is presently applied in this Office. The DARE method is a rational, orderly procedure that minimizes the number of decisions required of the decisionmaker.

## 8. Organizational Joint Problem-Solving
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Swinth
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
To carry out its day-to-day activities an organization will establish an organizational servomechanism. On the other hand, planning and problem-solving must be dealt with differently. Traditional methods, characterized here as the authority approach and the group incremental approach, have significant limitations. On the other hand organizations can and do effectively solve novel and complex tasks by organisational joint problem-solving. This approach is characterized in this paper by a set of propositions formulated to describe how authority and responsibility are distributed and how search and coordination are facilitated. This is done through: the linkage of a set of organizational centers around a mission assignment, the initial search at the overall task level, the search within task components, the broadcast of actions and task laws to all or many centers, the identification and resolution of inconsistencies between components and the conduct of joint search, and the iteration on these steps until an overall consistent set of actions has been established. Where the conditions (goal orientation, participant skill, communication facilities) for organizational joint problem-solving are not initially met, steps can be taken to aid and encourage the participants to use the procedures.

## 9. Subjective Estimates and Scheduling Decisions
### Author(s):
- William J. Abernathy
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
Network scheduling models typically assume that estimates of individual activities are stable and are not improved or degraded as progress is made in a project and the time to undertake a particular activity comes near. The formulation of scheduling models is usually compatible with this assumption about estimates and excludes the effect of actions such as rescheduling which might be taken in response to changes in estimation error.

## 10. Estimation of Forecast Errors for Seasonal-Style-Goods Sales
### Author(s):
- Sang Hoon Chang
- David E. Fyffe
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
Seasonal-style-goods inventories are characterized by the substantial losses associated with those merchandise items which are unsold at the end of a season. If the probability distribution for sales for the entire season were known, the decision problem would reduce to determining the optimal lot size, as in the classical newsboy problem. In reality, however, it may be possible to consider sales estimation as a multi-period inventory problem because there may be opportunities during the course of the season to review the earlier sales performance to reestimate forecast errors made earlier in the season, and to take appropriate action based on the new estimates. In this paper Kalman-Shaw linear feedback filtering is used to estimate previous forecast errors. The model is formulated in such a way that, given an initial forecast, the subsequent reestimation of the initial forecast error requires only the actual sales experience to date.

## 11. Managerial Work: Analysis from Observation
### Author(s):
- Henry Mintzberg
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1971
### Abstract:
The progress of management science is dependent on our understanding of the manager's working processes. A review of the literature indicates that this understanding is superficial at best. Empirical study of the work of five managers (supported by those research findings that are available) led to the following description: Managers perform ten basic roles which fall into three groupings. The interpersonal roles describe the manager as figurehead, external liaison, and leader; the information processing roles describe the manager as the nerve center of his organisation's information system; and the decision-making roles suggest that the manager is at the heart of the system by which organizational resource allocation, improvement, and disturbance decisions are made. Because of the huge burden of responsibility for the operation of these systems, the manager is called upon to perform his work at an unrelenting pace, work that is characterized by variety, discontinuity and brevity. Managers come to prefer issues that are current, specific, and ad hoc, and that are presented in verbal form. Aa a result, there is virtually no science in managerial work. The management scientist has done little to change this. He has been unable to understand work which has never been adequately described, and he has poor access to the manager's information, most of which is never documented. We must describe managerial work more precisely, and we must model the manager as a programmed system. Only then shall we be able to make a science of management.
