## 1. Relaxation Methods for Pure and Mixed Integer Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- G. Anthony Gorry

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
The usefulness of group theoretic methods in solving integer programming (IP) problems is extended by procedures for controlling the size of the groups. The main procedure given shows how an optimal linear programming basis can be altered to reduce the magnitude of its determinant thereby reducing the size of the group induced by the basis. An adaption of Benders' mixed IP algorithm is given which uses these methods. Some limited computational experience is given.

## 2. The Efficiency of Computer Algorithms for Plant Layout
### Author(s):
- Larry P. Ritzman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
This paper presents the results of comparing experimentally the performance of four of the more promising computer algorithms for the plant layout problem. CDC 3600 computer programs are tested with twenty-six test problems. The resulting solutions are evaluated in respect to both computer time requirements and objective function values. The experiment shows how these two performance measures vary with the algorithm used and various test problem characteristics. With the exception of two studies [Hillier, F. S., M. N. Connors. 1966. Quadratic assignment problem algorithms and the location of indivisible facilities. Management Sci.13 (1, September) 42–57; Nugent, C. E., T. E. Vollman, J. Ruml. 1968. An experimental comparison of techniques for the assignment of facilities to locations. Oper. Res.XVI (1, January–February) 150–173.], information on comparative performances of layout algorithms is very limited.

## 3. Stochastic Growth Models
### Author(s):
- Robert S. Kaplan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
Growth period models, previously treated in the literature, have assumed that the pattern of value increase of the growth asset is deterministic. In this paper, this assumption is relaxed by considering models in which the increase in value of an asset in a period is a random variable whose distribution is a function of either the value or the age of the asset at the start of the period. The expected increase in value is a decreasing function of the value or age of the asset so that the value of additional maturation time decreases as the asset ages. Dynamic programming is used to compute optimal policies as to when stochastic growth assets should be harvested. The steady state value function is shown to be directly analogous to that obtained when deterministic growth is assumed. Procedures for quickly computing both steady state policies and value functions are developed.

## 4. Inventory Control with Probabilistic Demand and Periodic Withdrawals
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
- L. Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
Many manufacturing firms produce component parts both for assembly into new products and to meet orders for spare parts. An inventory model for this situation would involve two types of demands: probabilistic demand as spares and deterministic (or scheduled) withdrawals as components for assembly. Relevant costs would include a setup cost for replenishment orders, inventory carrying costs, and backorder costs. An analytical model approximating these characteristics is formulated. An optimal dynamic program for the periodic review case is briefly discussed; this policy is extremely costly to implement, however. Two feasible operating policies are considered in the paper: a continuous review (Q, r)-type policy and a simple periodic review scheduling heuristic. The paper concludes with sample economic comparisons of the cost of the (Q, r)-type policy and the heuristic policy for a set of numerical examples.

## 5. Utility Functions for Multiattributed Consequences
### Author(s):
- Ralph L. Keeney
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
One of the important methodological problems concerning the application of decision analysis to complex problems is the restrictiveness of existing techniques for systematically assessing multiattributed utility functions valid for decision making under uncertainty. This is the problem addressed in this paper. Operational assumptions are postulated about the decision maker's preferences for multiattributed consequences, and functional forms of utility functions satisfying these assumptions are derived. The results are a number of representation theorems which simplify the assessment of the utility function provided the requisite assumptions hold. A special case of these results is the well-known additive utility function. A procedure to verify the appropriateness of the necessary assumptions is included.

## 6. Machine Replacement with Stochastic Costs
### Author(s):
- Basil A. Kalymon
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
The machine replacement model studied assumes that, at the end of each discrete interval, the state of deterioration of a machine and the current cost of replacement become known. A decision to keep or to replace must then be made, given that future deterioration and costs are determined by a known Markovian process. A finite set of possible states of deterioration is considered, including a “failed” state at which replacement by a “new” machine must occur. The operating cost is an increasing function of the level of deterioration, and replacement cost is the difference between new machine cost and salvage value. For both a finite and infinite planning horizon, given current cost, the optimality of a “control level” policy is demonstrated. Linear programming and policy iteration methods exploiting problem structure for the calculation of optimal policies are derived.

## 7. A Generalized Lagrange Multiplier Algorithm for Optimum or Near Optimum Production Scheduling
### Author(s):
- J. P. Evans
- F. J. Gould
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
In this paper we apply the concept of generalized Lagrange multipliers, introduced by Everett [Everett, H. 1963. Generalized lagrange multiplier method for solving problems of optimum allocation of resources. Oper. Res.XI 399–417.], to the development of an algorithm for a one-period multi-product production model, where the objective is to maximize profit subject to constraints on aggregate regular time and overtime production. We assume no difference between the cost of idle time and regular time labor, so that the regular time cost is fixed. Overtime cost is variable. The price for each product is constant (independent of quantity sold), and everything produced can be sold. The optimum production schedule (maximum profit) will depend upon revenues, overtime costs, setup times, and productivities.

## 9. Purchasing Priorities in Queues
### Author(s):
- K. R. Balachandran
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
A class of queueing problems is introduced in which each customer can purchase preferential treatment by making a payment. Each customer is assumed to select his payment so as to minimize his own expected cost, without regard for global considerations. A payment policy determines a customer's payment as a function of the information available. A payment policy is said to be stable if no one customer can reduce his expected cost by deviating from it, provided that all other customers follow it. The existence of stable payment policies which are not globally optimal is demonstrated in examples based on the M/M/1 queue.

## 10. A Facilities in Series Inventory Model with Nested Schedules
### Author(s):
- Stephen F. Love
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
We consider an n-period single-product inventory model with known requirements and separable concave production and storage costs. The model is a multi-echelon structure in which N facilities, labeled 1,…,N, are arranged in series. We show that if storage and production costs are respectively nondecreasing in order of facilities and nonincreasing in time, then an optimal schedule has the property that if in a given period, facility j produces, then facility j + 1 does also. This nested structure is exploited in an algorithm for finding an optimal schedule. The computational effort increases in proportion to the cube of the number of periods and linearly with the number of facilities. For the stationary infinite horizon case an algorithm yields a periodic optimal schedule.

## 11. Notes—Note on “Markovian Decision Models for Reject Allowance Problems”
### Author(s):
- Prakash G. Awate
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1972
### Abstract:
This note makes two contributions to M. Klein's formulation of the multiperiod reject allowance problem. First, a decomposition algorithm involving both linear and dynamic programming is proposed, and its computational savings over the straight simplex method are demonstrated. Second, in Klein's formulation where termination of production is allowed before reaching the set of terminal states, a lacuna is corrected by means of an enlargement of the state space.
