## 1. On Adaptive Programming
### Author(s):
- Jacob Marschak
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
In general, it is non-optimal to estimate, on the basis of past experience and as a basis for present action, an a posteriori statistical parameter other than the optimal action itself.

## 2. Statistical Control of Time Standards
### Author(s):
- Franciszek Jan Langier
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
An application of the statistical control of time standards developed by the author has, quite unexpectedly, created the possibility of a further application of this method as an indicator of organisational deficiencies in industry which, at the same time, makes it possible to locate these deficiencies in the respective plants, departments and workshops.

## 3. The Perils of Polynomials
### Author(s):
- Dudley J. Cowden
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
It is extremely dangerous to extrapolate a polynomial trend. Although there are other sources of danger, this study concentrates on the statistical error, which is very large for end values and increases alarmingly with extrapolations. Relative standard errors of polynomial trend values are summarized, and generalizations are made concerning the relative magnitude of the standard errors with changes in: (1) the degree of equation; (2) the number of observations; (3) the position of the trend value in time. The most interesting generalization is that the relative variance of a polynomial of degree m, as the position of the trend value departs farther and farther from the central position in time, may be described by a polynomial equation of degree 2m.

## 4. Assembly Line Balancing with a Precedence Matrix
### Author(s):
- Thomas R. Hoffmann
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Assembly line balancing consists of assigning work elements, which are subject to sequencing restrictions, along an assembly line in an optimal manner. The procedure presented in this paper leads to optimal line balances by operation on a matrix of zeros and ones called a “Precedence Matrix.” A nine element problem is used to illustrate the method in detail and comparisons with other procedures are made. Several balances obtained by applying the FORTRAN program appended to the paper to actual and sample problems are also shown.

## 5. Marketing Expansion—A Statistical Analysis
### Author(s):
- William R. King
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
The problem of introducing a consumer product into the market is considered as one of “testing” the product in some restricted group of marketing areas and utilizing the information thereby gained in drawing inference to potential new market areas.

## 6. Some Experiments in Planning and Operating
### Author(s):
- Bernard M. Bass
- Harold J. Leavitt
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Three experiments are reported relating types of planning activities to performance and attitudes. In general, the findings are consistent with earlier studies showing strong, positive relationship between participation in planning on the one hand and morale and productivity on the other. In all three experiments, performance and attitudes were better when subjects were using plans developed by themselves than plans developed by others.

## 7. The Quadratic Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- Eugene L. Lawler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
This paper presents a formulation of the quadratic assignment problem, of which the Koopmans-Beckmann formulation is a special case. Various applications for the formulation are discussed. The equivalence of the problem to a linear assignment problem with certain additional constraints is demonstrated. A method for calculating a lower bound on the cost function is presented, and this forms the basis for an algorithm to determine optimal solutions. Further generalizations to cubic, quartic, N-adic problems are considered.

## 8. Convex Programming by Tangential Approximation
### Author(s):
- H. O. Hartley
- R. R. Hocking
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
This paper describes an algorithm for the solution of the convex programming problem using the simplex method. The algorithm is computationally very simple, requiring the solution of a single linear programming problem which can be accomplished with only slight modification of existing computer codes for the revised simplex method.

## 9. Optimal Allocation of Leased Communication Lines
### Author(s):
- John E. Hosford
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Many large companies and governmental agencies transmit a large quantity of long distance communications between facilities. Most of these organizations reduce the expense of transmitting these communications by leasing private telephone lines instead of using commercial long distance. The monthly expense of leasing telephone lines between two facilities depends upon the number of lines leased and the air miles between facilities; it is independent of usage. For this analysis, the number of lines leased between two facilities is called a link, and the aggregate of all the links leased by an organization is called a network. This paper presents a technique to determine the optimal number of lines to be leased on each link, subject to a limit on the network expense. The technique was developed for Lockheed Missiles & Space Company at Sunnyvale, California, and its implementation has provided management with a more efficient means of controlling the leased line network.

## 10. Obsolescence of Commodities which are Subject to Deterioration in Store
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
When the useful life of a commodity in the field (“the field life”) is affected by the time the commodity spends in store prior to issue (“the store-age”), it is necessary to assess under what conditions goods become obsolete in the store before they are issued. Other problems of interest are: What is the total useful field life expected from a given stock-pile and what is the optimal quantity of goods that should be ordered? These problems are discussed for three cases:

## 11. A Heuristic Program for Locating Warehouses
### Author(s):
- Alfred A. Kuehn
- Michael J. Hamburger
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
The linear programing algorithms available for optimizing the routing of shipments in multi-plant, multi-destination systems cannot, in the current state of knowledge, be applied directly to the more general problem of determining the number and location of regional warehouses in large-scale distribution networks.

## 12. Remarks on the Kuehn-Hamburger Paper
### Author(s):
- Harvey N. Shycon
- Richard B. Maffei
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
The general conclusion of our examination of the work of the Messrs. Kuehn and Hamburger [Kuehn, A. A., M. J. Hamburger. 1963. A heuristic program for locating warehouses. Management Sci.9(4) 643–666.] is that they have made available an important tool for the study of the warehouse location problem. At present it appears to have significant limitations, but it is likely that further work can make it more useful. Ultimately some combination of these methods as a first approximation, and then the use of simulation techniques may provide the answer.

## 13. The Use of Regression Equations to Predict Manpower Requirements
### Author(s):
- Albert B. Drui
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Hundreds and perhaps thousands of decisions are made each day that a company operates and none is more complex than the effective reduction of manpower. These reductions must be accomplished on a selective basis so that the functional areas of the company may remain in balance as business conditions change. An objective analysis of the nature of the manpower reduction problem may be made through the use of regression equations. Results should be tempered through good business judgement, with “complexity factors” introduced to temper the decisions made. The technique is illustrated with an actual case study in order to make a more realistic presentation.

## 14. Resignation: What do we Really Know About it?
### Author(s):
- Geoffrey Y. Cornog
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Simple rate comparisons, the use of biographical characteristics of the individual, and the use of a formal definition of resignation are all parts of the method of resignation analysis in common use among students of administration, personnel technicians, and executives. Tests of the assumptions on which these common tools are based indicate that they are open to considerable objection, both for practical organization purposes and for purposes of research in organizational behavior.

## 15. Depreciation, Market Valuations, and Investment Theory
### Author(s):
- Vernon L. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
In this paper the theory of optimal replacement investment decisions is employed to interpret the problem of depreciation accounting and market valuation. An asset should be replaced when its net contribution to present worth from an additional (marginal) year of service no longer exceeds its external market value. Three concepts of depreciation are contained or involved in this investment decision rule: market value, capital recovery, and net contribution to present worth. Market value and capital recovery are commonly suggested “methods” of depreciation. Net contribution to present worth declines with asset age, and represents a concept of depreciation that generally may not coincide with market valuation in exchange. The existence of a market for a used asset is interpreted in terms of multiple uses (and marginal internal values) for an asset. Through exchange the asset is downgraded from one use to another until it is junked.

## 16. Communications to the Editor—A Note on Utility and Attitudes to Risk
### Author(s):
- Karl Borch
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1963
### Abstract:
Most theories of economic decision-making under uncertainty recognize that the value assigned to an uncertain prospect may differ from its “actuarial value,” or that the utility of an expectation may differ from the expectation of the utility. One way of formalizing this idea is to assume that the utility of a prospect is given by a function f(E, V), where E = the mathematical expectation of the gain, V = the variance of the gain. Various considerations about existence and possible shape of such function f(E, V) are presented.
