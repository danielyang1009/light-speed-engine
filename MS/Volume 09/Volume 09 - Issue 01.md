## 1. The New Approach to Management in the U.S. Defense Department
### Author(s):
- Charles J. Hitch
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
I am delighted to have this opportunity to visit Toronto and join with you in this joint meeting of the Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS) and The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). As many of you may know, I have for many years been keenly interested in the development of operations research, particularly its application to defense problems. Now I find myself as Comptroller of the U. S. Defense Department, busily engaged in trying to build a bridge between financial management and military planning to facilitate the application of operations research or systems analysis to military problems.

## 2. Organization Size and Efficiency: The Choice Between Reading and Writing
### Author(s):
- H. Theil
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
In a recent article in Management Science, F. P. Adler [Adler, F. P. 1960. Relationships between organization size and efficiency. Management Sci.7 (1, October) 80–84.] developed a simple model to analyze the implications of a growing research organization and the resulting increase of internal mail on the creative productivity of the individual worker of that organization. His approach involves the assumption of a constant fraction of the total written output being read by each individual, and this leads to the interesting conclusion that this total output approaches a finite upper limit when the size of the organization grows indefinitely. In plain terms, this means that when the organization is big enough, everyone devotes his time essentially to reading reports written by others.

## 3. On Sequential Decisions and Markov Chains
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
Several problems in the optimal control of dynamic systems are considered. When observed, a system is classifiable into one of a finite number of states and controlled by making one of a finite number of decisions. The sequence of observed states is a stochastic process dependent upon the sequence of decisions, in that the decisions determine the probability laws that operate on the system. Costs are associated with the sequence of states and decisions. It is shown that, for the problems considered, the optimal rules for controlling the system belong to a subclass of all possible rules and, within this subclass, the optimal rules can be derived by solving linear programming problems.

## 4. Inspection—Maintenance—Replacement Schedules Under Markovian Deterioration
### Author(s):
- Morton Klein
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
A problem of finding optimal policies for the management of systems whose deterioration can be expressed as a Markov chain is considered. Using methods due to Manne and Derman for sequential decision problems involving average cost per unit time criteria, it is shown that the problem can be formulated in linear programming terms.

## 5. Systems Evaluation and Repricing Theorems
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
When a system is described in terms of a linear programming problem max cTx with Ax ≦ b, x ≧ 0, study of its properties, e.g., sensitivity analyses, etc., focuses on effects of alterations in the triple (A, b, c) on the properties of the system. These effects are non-linear and generally lead one away from a model with convenient special structure to much more complex systems. In this paper, methods (“repricing-reprocessing” theorems) are developed which (under certain assumptions about real world behavior) permit one to assess these effects exactly by means of a model of the same structure which can be prescribed in advance. The proofs of these theorems are accomplished by the “chained construction” methods of Charnes and Cooper. Approximation techniques and exact characterization of the non-linearities are also presented.

## 6. A General Algorithm for the Optimal Distribution of Effort
### Author(s):
- William Karush
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
The problem of distribution of effort is that of the optimal allocation of a given resource among various activities, that is, maximize ∑i=1nfi(xi) subject to ∑i=1nxi = w, xi ≥ 0. This paper presents an algorithm for obtaining the optimal allocation as a function of w, when the fi are arbitrary piecewise-linear, continuous functions. The method is recursive and appropriate for hand or machine computation. It is an extension of the well-known technique of ordering the segments of all the fi according to decreasing slope which applies in the special case when each fi has decreasing slopes (that is, is marginally decreasing).

## 7. Scheduling Tasks with Deadlines and Non-Linear Loss Functions
### Author(s):
- Albert Schild
- Irwin J. Fredman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
The problem of scheduling tasks with deadlines and linear loss functions was discussed in some detail in two papers [McNaughton, R. Scheduling with deadlines and loss functions. Management Sci.6(1) 1–12; Schild, A., I. J. Fredman. On scheduling tasks with associated linear loss functions. Management Sci.7(3) 280–285] by Robert McNaughton and the authors. In this paper, the problem of scheduling with nonlinear loss functions is attacked. In particular, certain criteria will be established for quadratic loss functions and an algorithm is proposed which will yield an optimal scheduling—i.e., a minimal total loss—for nonlinear loss functions in general.

## 8. Sensitivity Analysis of Cost Coefficient Estimates: The Case of Linear Decision Rules for Employment and Production
### Author(s):
- C. Van De Panne
- P. Bosje
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
This paper considers the consequences of errors in the cost function which underlies linear decision rules generally and in particular those developed by Holt, c.s., for the paint factory case. By differentiating the decision rules with respect to the various cost coefficients expressions for the decision errors due to errors in the cost function are obtained. First-period decision errors corresponding to a one per cent error in each of the cost coefficients are given numerically, together with first-period losses. Only infinite horizons are considered.

## 9. A Random Walk Production-Inventory Policy: Rationale and Implementation
### Author(s):
- Daniel Orr
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
The smoothing of fluctuations in production and inventory has been handled successfully as a problem in servomechanisms: an optimal linear filter (production scheduling policy) balances costs of inventory fluctuation and costs of production fluctuation. This approach requires the system to respond (by making production rate changes) either continuously or at regular intervals: the usual assumption is that the cost of responding is proportional to the size of the response. This paper explores some reasons why the frequency of production changes may have to be controlled, and offers a new class of policies, called random walk policies, to accomplish this. One of these, the (a, b, c) policy, is investigated for stationary operating characteristics, and a specific example is provided to illustrate the technique of finding optimal values for policy parameters. Some of the characteristics of systems in which random walk inventory policies may be useful are discussed; and more general techniques for identifying the form of the optimal control policy are mentioned.

## 10. A Note on the Optimality of (S, s) Policies in Inventory Theory
### Author(s):
- Edward Zabel
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
In this paper a proof of Herbert Scarf's on the optimality of (S, s) policies in inventory theory is extended to cases where differentiability of cost functions may not be available. In addition to an ordering cost composed of a unit cost plus a reorder cost all that is needed in the proof is that the expected holding and shortage cost function be convex.

## 11. Optimal Service Policies and Finite Time Horizons
### Author(s):
- C. R. Carr
- C. W. Howe
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
This paper characterizes optimal service policies in terms of the frequency and timing of services which are intended to maintain a stock of assets. The model is non-stochastic. The results are obtained by a two-stage step-wise minimization procedure wherein dynamic programming is first used to characterize sub-optimal policies and then the calculus of finite differences is utilized to select the optimal policy. The effect of the time horizon on the optimal policy is emphasized throughout and, in two specific interpretations of the model, the classical results of the economic lot-size and equipment replacement policy are shown to be limits of more general policies.

## 12. Rationality Postulates for Bargaining Solutions in Cooperative and in Non-Cooperative Games
### Author(s):
- John C. Harsanyi
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1962
### Abstract:
The von Neumann-Morgenstern theory yields a determinate solution (a unique payoff vector) only for the two-person zero-sum game and some other special cases. But if we adopt a small number of additional rationality postulates we obtain determinate solutions for all known classes of games. The rationality postulates needed include the expected-utility maximization postulate; postulates involving payoff-dominance concepts; and postulates imposing certain consistency requirements on the expectations that rational players can entertain about each other's strategies. For some games the solution can be defined essentially in terms of payoff-dominance concepts. But more generally the solutions depend on the analysis of bargaining among the players.
