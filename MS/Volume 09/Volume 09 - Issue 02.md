## 1. Non-Linear Programming—A Survey
### Author(s):
- W. S. Dorn
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
Some of the more recent theoretical and computational developments in non-linear programming are surveyed. The notions of Lagrange multipliers and duality are discussed together with applications of these ideas to scientific and business problems. Moreover, several algorithms for solving quadratic programming problems are reviewed. Explicit rules are given for two of these algorithms, and a simple example is solved by both methods. A large step gradient method for the solution of convex programs is given and one of Gomory's algorithms for integer programming is described. Simple examples are solved using both of these techniques. Linear fractional programming is also discussed briefly.

## 2. Duality in Semi-Infinite Programs and Some Works of Haar and Carathéodory
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
- K. Kortanek
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
By constructing a new infinite dimensional space for which the extreme point—linear independence and opposite sign theorems of Charnes and Cooper continue to hold, and, building on a little-known work of Haar (herein presented), an extended dual theorem comparable in precision and exhaustiveness to the finite space theorem is developed. Building further on this a dual theorem is developed for arbitrary convex programs with convex constraints which subsumes in principle all characterizations of optimality or duality in convex programming. No differentiability or constraint qualifications are involved, and the theorem lends itself to new computational procedures.

## 3. Simulation Tests of Lot Size Programming
### Author(s):
- B. P. Dzielinski
- C. T. Baker
- A. S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
This paper presents the results of some digital computer simulation tests of a procedure for the economic planning of lot sizes, work force, and inventories. A dynamic, deterministic, linear programming model was used to obtain approximate solutions to the actual problem which is both dynamic and stochastic. The tests were made with data taken from an actual factory. An alternate procedure, based upon single-item inventory control, was also tested; its results were compared with those obtained from the linear programming model. On the basis of these tests, this linear programming method appears to offer a promising method for the practical economic planning of production activities.

## 4. Optimality of (s, S) Policies in the Infinite Horizon Dynamic Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Iglehart
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
The optimal ordering policy for a n-period dynamic inventory problem in which the ordering cost is linear plus a fixed reorder cost and the other one-period costs are convex is characterized by a pair of critical numbers, (sn, Sn); see Scarf, [4]. In this paper we give bounds for the sequences {sn} and {Sn} and discuss their limiting behavior. The limiting (s, S) policy characterizes the optimal ordering policy for the infinite horizon problem. Similar results are obtained if there is a time-lag in delivery.

## 5. Replacement of Randomly Deteriorating Equipment
### Author(s):
- M. Eisen
- M. Leibowitz
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
The replacement of a machine which deteriorates at a random rate is considered. We measure this deterioration in terms of a cost per unit time—i.e., a cost-density γ(t) where t is the age of the machine. Given the probability distribution of γ(t) and the replacement cost R(c, t) when γ(t) = c, we discuss optimal replacement using two different procedures:

## 6. A Simplified Model for Portfolio Analysis
### Author(s):
- William F. Sharpe
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
This paper describes the advantages of using a particular model of the relationships among securities for practical applications of the Markowitz portfolio analysis technique. A computer program has been developed to take full advantage of the model: 2,000 securities can be analyzed at an extremely low cost—as little as 2% of that associated with standard quadratic programming codes. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that the relatively few parameters used by the model can lead to very nearly the same results obtained with much larger sets of relationships among securities. The possibility of low-cost analysis, coupled with a likelihood that a relatively small amount of information need be sacrificed make the model an attractive candidate for initial practical applications of the Markowitz technique.

## 7. A Heuristic Algorithm and Simulation Approach to Relative Location of Facilities
### Author(s):
- Gordon C. Armour
- Elwood S. Buffa
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new methodology for determining suboptimum relative location patterns for physical facilities. It presents a computer program governed by an algorithm which determines how relative location patterns should be altered to obtain sequentially the most improved pattern with each change, commands their alteration, evaluates the results of alterations, and identifies the sub-optimum relative location patterns.3 The computer output yields a block diagramatic layout of the facility areas, and the areas need not be equal.4 A manufacturing plant layout example is used because the methodology is well illustrated by reference to some kind of example, and this one is commonly known. The methodology itself, however, is general in nature and not restricted to such applications.

## 8. Consistency and Optimality in Managerial Decision Making
### Author(s):
- E. H. Bowman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
This paper reports some research, ideas, and theory about managerial decision making. The first research projects dealt with are aggregate production and employment scheduling. From this is developed the idea that management's own (past) decisions can be incorporated into a system of improving their present decisions. Decision rules are developed, with the coefficients in the rules derived from management's past decisions (rather than from a cost or value model). Half a dozen test cases are used to illustrate and test these ideas (theory). Some rationale about decision making in organizations and criteria surfaces is supplied to help interpret the major ideas presented.

## 9. The Dissemination and Use of Recorded Scientific Information
### Author(s):
- Miles W. Martin
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
Two separate field studies of chemists and physicists were made which were concerned with how scientists spend their time, especially the amount and kind of communication in which they engage. Approximately 2,200 chemists and physicists were observed.

## 10. On the Determination of Occupational Categories in an Organization
### Author(s):
- David S. Stoller
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
Typically, a personnel assignment model is based on the assumption that ni persons of skill type i; i = 1, …, k, are to be assigned over mj jobs requiring skill j; j = 1, …, s, with a penalty score, dij, for assigning a person of skill type i to a job requiring j. Then algorithms are sought for an assignment matrix, X = ‖xij‖, which minimizes ∑i,jxijdij, under certain constraints, where xij is the number of persons of skill type i assigned to jobs of skill type j. An input to the problem, then is a determination, for a given organization, of the occupational categories, j = 1, …, s, to which personnel will be assigned. This paper applies the problem to a repair organization. Before one can determine the number of repair men in an organization, among other factors, one must determine the number of their occupational categories.

## 11. Some Notes on the Similarity of Three Management Science Models and Their Analysis by Connectivity Matrix Techniques
### Author(s):
- Alan W. Steinberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1963
### Abstract:
Certain Properties of Connectivity Matrices are noted to be similarly applicable to Three Management Science Models which have hitherto been investigated as independent structures: (1) PERT Network Analysis; (2) Parts Explosion Techniques; and (3) Business System Data Flow Analysis. These properties suggest some computational techniques which should be helpful in the analysis of systems described by the three models.
