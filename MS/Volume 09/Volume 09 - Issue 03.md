## 2. Optimal Replacement Policies for a Ballistic Missile
### Author(s):
- D. W. Jorgenson
- J. J. McCall
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
This paper applies, to ballistic missile systems, replacement policies for equipment subject to stochastic failures in which the actual state of the system—good or failed—is not known with certainty. Although it applies these policies only to the missile itself, optimal maintenance policies for the system as a whole are conceptually similar. The criterion employed for comparison of alternative maintenance policies is to minimize the total cost per expected piece of equipment good per period of time. Maximization of system reliability is a special case of this criterion which ignores the financial costs of maintenance actions.

## 3. On the Symmetry Approach to the Committee Decision Problem
### Author(s):
- H. Theil
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
The order of discussion is as follows. In Section 2 the basic ideas (which are already “classical”) are briefly restated and the problem is formulated. In Section 3 some proposals are made for the weights of the linear combination of individual preference functions. Section 4 illustrates the committee decision problem by a very simple example of measures of central tendency, the solution of which suggests a method for solving the general problem. Section 5 is the heart of the article; it introduces the symmetry condition. The last section deals with the case when symmetry cannot be realized.

## 4. A Structural Method of Computing Project Cost Polygons
### Author(s):
- William Prager
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
For a project that consists of numerous jobs subject to technological ordering restrictions the polygon representing project cost versus completion time is to be determined when the normal and crash completion times are known for each job and the cost of doing the job varies linearly between these times. A linear programming formulation of this problem was given by Kelley [Kelley, J. E., Jr. 1961. Critical-path planning and scheduling: Mathematical basis. Oper. Res.9 296–320.] and a network flow formulation by Fulkerson [Fulkerson, D. R. 1961. A network flow computation for project cost curves. Management Sci.7 (2, January) 167–178.]. Since the traditional mathematical background of civil engineers includes neither linear programming nor network flow theory, these methods are not as widely used in the building industry as they deserve. This paper shows that Fulkerson's algorithm can be given a structural interpretation using concepts that are familiar to civil engineers.

## 5. Minimum-Cost Cattle Feed Under Probabilistic Protein Constraints
### Author(s):
- C. van de Panne
- W. Popp
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
The optimal composition of cattle feed, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem in the case of certainty, is considered when compositions of inputs vary. In the corresponding linear programming formulation the coefficients of the constraints are not constant but can be considered as stochastic. Reformulating the constraints as chance constraints, a nonlinear programming problem results. For an illustrative example this problem is solved using one of Zoutendijk's methods of feasible directions.

## 6. Comparative Evaluation of Performance Using Multiple Criteria
### Author(s):
- Herbert Terry
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
Comparative evaluation of performance, whether of personnel, products, or projects, may be necessary for purposes of selection, assignment, or improvement. Where multiple criteria are involved, it is useful to derive a single measure which will meaningfully distinguish among the competing items. In deriving such a measure, three factors are significant:

## 7. The Derivation of Probabilistic Information for the Evaluation of Risky Investments
### Author(s):
- Frederick S. Hillier
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
The amount of risk involved is often one of the important considerations in the evaluation of proposed investments. This paper is concerned with the derivation of the type of explicit, well-defined, and comprehensive information that is essential for an accurate appraisal of a risky investment. It is shown how, under certain assumptions, such information in the form of the probability distribution of the present worth, annual cost, or internal rate of return of the proposed investment can be derived. The derivation and use of this information is then illustrated by an example.

## 8. An Experimental Application of the DELPHI Method to the Use of Experts
### Author(s):
- Norman Dalkey
- Olaf Helmer
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
This paper gives an account of an experiment in the use of the so-called DELPHI method, which was devised in order to obtain the most reliable opinion consensus of a group of experts by subjecting them to a series of questionnaires in depth interspersed with controlled opinion feedback.

## 9. Indices of the Hierarchical Structure of Industrial Organizations
### Author(s):
- William M. Evan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
A postulate common to both the structural-functional theory of social stratification and to organization theory is that hierarchical organization is functionally necessary. An alternative formulation of this postulate—which is probably more heuristic—is that different degrees of hierarchical organization have different consequences for total and partial social systems.

## 10. Optimal Replacement and Maintenance Under Markovian Deterioration with Probability Bounds on Failure
### Author(s):
- Cyrus Derman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
A system is observed periodically and classified into one of a finite number of states. On the basis of the observations certain maintenance or replacement decisions are made. Transitions probabilities from state to state are determined by the decisions. The problem considered is that of finding the decision rule which maximizes the expected length of time between replacements subject to the side conditions that the probabilities of replacement through certain undesirable states are bounded by prescribed numbers.

## 11. On the Equivalence of Some Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Eliezer Naddor
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
In an earlier paper (“Some Models of Inventory and an Application”, Management Science, Vol. 2, No. 4, July, 1956) the author analyzed four inventory systems which were referred to as Models I, II, III, IV. In the present paper the notion of equivalence of inventory systems is introduced and it is shown that Models I and II are equivalent and so are models III and IV. The results are also extended to systems with non-zero leadtime. In all cases considered it is shown that the total expected costs of the systems (with or without leadtime) can be expressed in the form

## 12. A Study of Inventory Theory
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1963
### Abstract:
The paper is divided along the following lines. First, I illustrate the inventory models having Deterministic Demand and then consider the class of Probabilistic Demand Models. Within the latter class, I consider the single period steady state case, and then the N-period dynamic inventory model. For the N-period case, I then report results covering non-zero procurement lead time, demand rate varying each period, joint solution of the inventory-control-production scheduling decision, and a multi-echelon model. Finally, since in the previous consideration of probabilistic demand models, knowledge of the demand probability distribution and its parameters were assumed, I discuss a paper dealing with the use of Bayes estimates.
