## 1. Appointment Methods for the House of Representatives and the Court Challenges
### Author(s):
- Lawrence R. Ernst
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
Four different methods have been used to apportion the seats in the United States House of Representatives among the states following the decennial census. The current method, the method of equal proportions, has been used for each census since 1940. In 1991, for the first time in U.S. history, the constitutionality of an apportionment method was challenged in court, by Montana and Massachusetts in separate cases. Montana proposed two methods as alternatives to equal proportions, the methods of harmonic means and smallest divisors, while Massachusetts proposed the method of major fractions. On March 31, 1992, in a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of equal proportions. This author wrote the declarations on the mathematical and statistical issues used by the defense in these cases. The declarations in the Massachusetts case contain several new theoretical and empirical results. This paper discusses the technical issues in these cases together with a brief history of the apportionment problem.

## 2. Information Asymmetry, Participation, and Long-Term Contracts
### Author(s):
- K. Sivaramakrishnan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
This paper examines the economic value of participative processes in the setting of long-term incentives. When informational asymmetries arise between employers (supervisors) and employees (subordinates) about future states, questions arise as to whether and when resolving these informational asymmetries produces economic gains. To address these questions, I use a two-period principal agent contracting framework in which the agent (employee) receives imperfect private information about the second period state in the first period, and make a welfare comparison between two alternative communication regimes.

## 3. Stochastic Optimization by Simulation: Numerical Experiments with the M/M/1 Queue in Steady-State
### Author(s):
- Pierre L'Ecuyer
- Nataly Giroux
- Peter W. Glynn
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
This paper gives numerical illustrations of the behavior of stochastic approximation, combined with different derivative estimation techniques, to optimize a steady-state system. It is a companion paper to L'Ecuyer and Glynn (1993), which gives convergence proofs for most of the variants experimented here. The numerical experiments are made with a simple M/M/1 queue, which while simple, serves to illustrate the basic convergence properties and Possible pitfalls of the various techniques.

## 4. Evaluating Echelon Stock (R, nQ) Policies in Serial Production/Inventory Systems with Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- Fangruo Chen
- Yu-Sheng Zheng
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
This paper studies echelon stock (R, nQ) policies in serial production/inventory systems with stochastic demand. We provide a recursive procedure to compute the steady state echelon inventory levels of the systems, which can be used to evaluate the long-run average holding and backorder costs as well as other performance measures. The procedure is based upon an observation of a relationship between the inventory status of adjacent stages in a serial system. We also device exact formulas for replenishment frequencies and setup costs. Our results apply to both continuous-review systems with compound Poisson demand and periodic-review systems with independent, identically distributed demands. A preliminary numerical study was conducted to explore the cost effectiveness of echelon stock (R, nQ) policies. For two-stage systems with simple Poisson demand, we compared among the minimum costs of echelon stock (R, nQ) policies, a lower bound on the minimum achievable costs, and the minimum costs of installation stock (R, nQ) policies. Finally, we present a modification of an existing approximate evaluation procedure.

## 5. A Tabu Search Heuristic for the Vehicle Routing Problem
### Author(s):
- Michel Gendreau
- Alain Hertz
- Gilbert Laporte
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to describe TABUROUTE, a new tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with capacity and route length restrictions. The algorithm considers a sequence of adjacent solutions obtained by repeatedly removing a vertex from its current route and reinserting it into another route. This is done by means of a generalized insertion procedure previously developed by the authors. During the course of the algorithm, infeasible solutions are allowed. Numerical tests on a set of benchmark problems indicate that tabu search out performs the best existing heuristics, and TABUROUTE often produces the best known solutions.

## 6. Impact of Electronic Data Interchange Technology on JIT Shipments
### Author(s):
- Kannan Srinivasan
- Sundar Kekre
- Tridas Mukhopadhyay
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
We investigates the degree to which increasing vertical information integration using Electronic Data Interchange technology enhances shipment performance of suppliers in a Just-in-Time environment. Our analysis of shipment data in the automobile industry suggests that shipment performance degrades substantially due to increases in part variety and trading partners from diverse industries. However, investments in information technology to support both the sharing of JIT schedules and the establishment of integrated information links are related to significant reduction in the level of shipment discrepancies.

## 7. Approximation Procedures for the One-Warehouse Multi-Retailer System
### Author(s):
- Lu Lu
- Marc E. Posner
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
Two heuristic procedures for a one-warehouse multi-retailer system are developed. Based on the accuracy desired, the first heuristic evaluates a specified number of points. The relative error is within a bound that approaches 1/(2 ln 2)  1  2.014%. The complexity of the heuristic is O(n) for a fixed number of evaluations. Although our bound only approaches the one of Roundy (1985), when only a small number of points are evaluated, our method is faster. We show that the bound for our procedure and two bounds proposed by Roundy (1985) are tight.

## 8. Learning and Efficiency in a Gambling Market
### Author(s):
- James D. Dana
- Michael M. Knetter
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
We present a statistical model which uses data on National Football League games and betting lines to study how agents learn from past outcomes and to test market efficiency. Using Kalman Filter estimation, we show that terms' abilities exhibit substantial week-to-week variation during the season. This provides an ideal environment in which to study how agents learn from past information. While we do not find strong evidence of market inefficiency, we are able to make several observations on market learning. In particular, agents have more difficulty learning from noisy observations and appear to weight recent observations less that our statistical model suggests is optimal.

## 9. Capturing the Correlations of Fixed-income Instruments
### Author(s):
- John M. Mulvey
- Stavros A. Zenios
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
This paper develops a framework for managing portfolios of fixed income instruments based on traditional principles from the equities market, i.e., based on diversification. It shows, through an analysis of the high-yield bond market over the period 1987 to 1991, that fixed-income prices could be highly correlated. These correlations can be quantified and integrated, in a systematic way, in an asset/liability management framework. For vanishing fixed income securities, however, we cannot resort to statistical analysis of historical data in order to quantify correlations. The paper develops a forward-looking simulation procedure for capturing correlations. Applications are illustrated for examples from high-yield bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The superiority of the proposed approach over the traditional portfolio immunization techniques is demonstrated in the context of funding an insurance liability stream with mortgage instruments.

## 10. Dominance Relations Among Standardized Variables
### Author(s):
- Frank Milne
- Edwin H. Neave
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
This paper examines stochastic dominance relations among discrete random variables defined on a common integer domain. While these restrictions are minimal, they lead both to new theoretical results and to simpler proofs of existing one. The new results, obtained for dominance criteria of any degree, generalize an SSD result of Rothschild-Stiglitz to describe how for any dominance criterion a dominated variable is equal in distribution to a dominated variable plus perturbation terms. If the variables are comparable under FSD the perturbations are downward shift terms, while under SSD (TSD) all but two (three) of the perturbations are zero mean disturbance terms (noise). Under SSD the remaining perturbations are shift terms and under TSD noise and shift terms. However, under either SSD or TSD these remaining terms are identically zero if the variables to be compared have equal means. The paper also finds new proofs of well known results relating dominance criteria to preferences.

## 11. Extensions to Class Dominance Characteristics
### Author(s):
- Kashi R. Balachandran
- Suresh Radhakrishnan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
Balachandran and Schaefer (1979) show that if in the individual optimum class A dominates with a first come first serve queue, there could exist cases where in the public optimum class B dominates. We derive conditions under which providing a nonpreemptive priority allows both classes of users to use the facility and get a higher expected public net benefit than the first come first serve queue. The class that is provided the higher priority may or not be the class that dominates in the public optimum under the first come first serve queue. That means that introducing a priority scheme may switch the class that is given preference in the public optimum.

## 12. Investigating the Relationship Between Time in Market and Pioneering Advantage
### Author(s):
- Christina L. Brown
- James M. Lattin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
In field studies based on pre-test market and scanner data, researchers have found evidence of pioneering advantage in the form of an order-of-entry effect: a permanent share advantage that is greatest for the first brand to enter a market and smaller for each subsequently entering brand. Conceptually, an order-of-entry effect implies that the share advantage of a market pioneer over the second entrant is constant, regardless of the length the of time the pioneer is alone in the market or the length of time since the entry of the second brand. We argue that pioneering advantage is also related to a brand's length of time in the market: the longer the brand's time in market (during which time it can impact consumer learning and influence consumer perceptions and preferences), the greater its relative share advantage. We present a parsimonious model of this time-in-market effect and test of model using two data sources: cross-category data collected and analyzed by Urban et al. (1986) and regional roll-out data for a single product category.

## 13. Note: The Impact of Leadtime and Years of Competitive Rivalry on Pioneer Market Share Advantages
### Author(s):
- Lenard C. Huff
- William T. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
Research has established that for surviving brands, market pioneers have a higher average market share than later entrants. By moving first, market pioneers often develop sustainable market share advantages. Longer leadtime, which is the time between entries, should increase these pioneer advantages. Using two leadtime measures, this prediction is supported across 34 categories of frequently purchased consumer goods. Increasing the years of competitive rivalry should help a later entrant slowly reduct the pioneer's market share advantage. After more than two decades in the market, second entants have eliminated the pioneer's market share advantage, but third and later entrants continue to trail the pioneer.

## 14. The U-line Line Balancing Problem
### Author(s):
- G. J. Miltenburg
- J. Wijngaard
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
The traditional line balancing (LB) problem considers a production line in which stations are arranged consecutively in a line. A balance is determined by grouping tasks into stations while moving forward (or backward) through a precedence network. Recently many production lines are being arranged in a U-line, as a consequence of the use of just-in-time production principles in many factories. In this paper the U-line LB problem is introduced and modelled, and solution procedures are developed. It more complex than the traditional LB problem because tasks can be grouped by moving forward, backward, or simultaneously in both directions, through the precedence network. We also show how solution techniques developed for the traditional LB problem can be adapted for use with the new problem. Some computational results for well-known problems from the literature are given.

## 15. Note: Due-date Assignment to Multi-Job Customer Orders
### Author(s):

- Michael J. Magazine
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1994
### Abstract:
The paper addresses deterministic, nonpreemptive scheduling of jobs that are immediately available for processing on a single machine. The jobs are partitioned into several multi-job customer orders. The problem is to determine a due-date for each customer order and to schedule all the jobs such that a total penalty function is minimized. The total penalty function is the sum of penalties for job earliness, penalties for job tardiness, and penalties associated with the lead times of customer orders. The main results is that there is an optimal solution in which the jobs within each customer order are processed contiguously. This is an appealing feature in terms of implementation. Efficient algorithms are presented for solving special cases of this problem.
