### Abstract:
We examine the problem of pricing in a market where one brand acts as a price leader. We develop a procedure to estimate a leader's price rule, which is optimal given a sales target objective, and allows for the inclusion of demand forecasts. We illustrate our estimation procedure by calibrating this optimal price rule for both the leader and the follower using data on past sales and prices from the mid-size sedan segment of the U.S. automobile market. Our results suggest that a leader-follower system (Stackelberg) seems more consistent with the pricing behavior in this market, than a mutually independent pricing rule (Nash). We also find that our optimal price rule explains this market data better than other pricing schemes that do not account for optimizing behavior on the part of the leader and the follower.

- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
We investigate a firm's choice of prices and qualities of a product line to signal competitive advantage to potential entrants and to discourage entry. The market consists of customer segments with different valuations for product quality. We demonstrate that a higher quality and a higher price of each product in the line convey the firm's advantage to potential competition and prevents entry. We discuss implications for optimal product line selection when customers self-select a product from the line.

## 3. A Decision Support Software on Bidding for Job Interviews in College Placement Offices
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Many university placement offices employ a bidding system to allocate on-campus recruiter interview slots to students. Typically, a student is given (say) 700 points each week to bid on the firms visiting that week. Interview slots for each firm are assigned beginning with the highest bidder until all slots are filled. This paper describes the mathematical modeling behind a decision support system for helping students to bid in such a system. It has three components. The first component elicits a student's utilities of getting an interview with the various firms. The second component estimates the probability of getting an interview with a particular firm for a given bid amount. The final component considers our bidding problem as the maximization of a student's expected utility, which can be formulated as a nonlinear integer programming (IP) problem. It is shown that this IP problem can be transformed into a number of nonlinear programming problems without integer requirements, which can then be solved very rapidly to give on-line bidding recommendations to a large number of students.

## 4. Modeling and Heuristic Worst-Case Performance Analysis of the Two-Level Network Design Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
This paper studies a multi-facility network synthesis problem, called the Two-level Network Design (TLND) problem, that arises in the topological design of hierarchical communication, transportation, and electric power distribution networks. We are given an undirected network containing two types of nodesprimary and secondaryand fixed costs for installing either a primary or a secondary facility on each edge. Primary nodes require higher grade interconnections than secondary nodes, using the more expensive primary facilities. The TLND problem seeks a minimum cost connected design that spans all the nodes, and connects primary nodes via edges containing primary facilities; the design can use either primary or secondary edges to connect the secondary nodes. The TLND problem generalizes the well-known Steiner network problem and the hierarchical network design problem. In this paper, we study the relationship between alternative model formulations for this problem (e.g., directed and undirected models), and analyze the worst-case performance for a composite TLND heuristic based upon solving embedded subproblems (e.g., minimum spanning tree and either Steiner tree or shortest path subproblems). When the ratio of primary to secondary costs is the same for all edges and when we solve the embedded subproblems optimally, the worst-case performance ratio of the composite TLND heuristic is 4/3. This result applies to the hierarchical network design problem with constant primary-to-secondary cost ratio since its subproblems are shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems. For more general situations, we express the TLND heuristic worst-case ratio in terms of the performance of any heuristic used to solve the embedded Steiner tree subproblem. A companion paper develops and tests a dual ascent procedure that generates tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of a multi-level extension of this problem.

## 5. A Rigorous Computational Comparison of Alternative Solution Methods for the Generalized Assignment Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
Statistical experimental design and analysis is a cornerstone for scientific inquiry that is rarely applied in reporting computational testing. This approach is employed to study the relative performance characteristics of the four leading algorithmic and heuristic alternatives to solve the Linear Cost Generalized Assignment Problem (LCGAP) against a newly developed heuristic, Variable-Depth Search Heuristic (VDSH). In assessing the relative effectiveness of the prominent solution methodologies and VDSH under the effects of various problem characteristics, we devise a carefully designed experimentation of state-of-the-art implementations; through a rigorous statistical analysis we identify the most efficient method(s) for commonly studied LCGAPs, and determine the effect on solution time and quality of problem class and size.

## 6. Efficient Interactive Methods for a Class of Multiattribute Shortest Path Problems
### Author(s):
- Mordechai I. Henig
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
Given an acyclic network and a preference-order relation on paths, when and how can Bellman's principle of optimality be combined with interactive programming to efficiently locate an optimal path? We show that if preferences are defined via a collection of attributes, then, under common conditions, the principle of optimality is valid if and only if the preferences can be represented by a linear (value) function over the attributes. Consequently, an interactive programming method is suggested which assesses the value function while using the principle of optimality to efficiently search for an optimal path.

## 7. Sequential Defect Removal Sampling
### Author(s):
- Douglas G. Bonett
- J. Arthur Woodward
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
Standard inspection methods underestimate the true number of defects or nonconformities in a complex product (e.g., automobile, mobile home, airplane, circuit board, computer program) when an inspector is unable to identify every defect with certainty. A nonlinear statistical model with a nonlinear constraint is developed for estimating the unknown number of defects in a product when inspection is imperfect. A sequential defect removal sampling plan is defined in which two or more inspectors examine in sequence a product or sample of products and then mark or correct any observed defects prior to the next inspection. The number of defects identified by each inspector provides the information needed to estimate the number of defects in the product in addition to the number of defects that have eluded all inspectors. A goodness-of-fit test of model assumptions is presented. A test of hypothesis regarding the unknown number of defects in quality improvement experiments also is described.

## 8. Capacity Acquisition and Disposal with Discrete Facility Sizes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
We consider some key features of capacity acquisition, disposal, and replacement decisions in this paper that are seldom captured in capacity expansion models in the literature. First, capacity is often purchased in the form of equipment which comes only in a few discrete sizes. Second, some or all of the capacity may be replaced periodically due to the availability of better and cheaper equipment, or due to deterioration and increased operating costs of older equipment. Finally, some capacity may be disposed due to declining demand. We present integer programming formulations that model all of these aspects. We identify special structures in these formulations that are then exploited to develop efficient procedures for solving the linear relaxation optimally. The solution to the linear relaxation together with a heuristic interchange procedure are used in a branch-and-bound procedure to obtain optimal solutions. Computational results are presented that establish the effectiveness of the procedures in solving realistic problems to optimality.

## 9. An Improvement-Type Layout Algorithm for Single and Multiple-Floor Facilities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper we introduce the use of spacefilling curves in facility layout, and we extend a well-known facility layout algorithm () to facilities with multiple floors. Spacefilling curves make it possible to exchange any two departments and to use more powerful exchange routines than two-way or three-way exchanges. We also further enhance CRAFT by controlling department shapes, and (with multiple floors) by allowing flexible departmental area requirements. Although the algorithm we present can be used for any single-floor or multi-floor facility layout problem, its primary target is production facilities. A tailored version of the algorithm was successfully tested and used in a large, multi-floor production facility. The algorithm differs significantly from two previous extensions of to multi-floor facilities.

## 10. The Flexibility of Production Processes: A General Framework
### Author(s):
- Xavier de Groote
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1994
### Abstract:
Various models have been developed over the years to analyze the many facets of the flexibility of production and operations systems. This paper proposes a general framework for the modeling and analysis of flexibility. The argument hinges upon the distinction between flexibilitya property of the technologyand diversitya property of the environment in which the technology is operated. Flexibility is characterized as a hedge against diversity. Intuitive strategic properties that are conventionally attributed to flexibility are shown to follow directly from this framework. As illustrated by the different examples that are discussed, many existing models can be naturally interpreted in this context. As an application, the effect of load imbalance on a set of parallel machines is analyzed. The problem sheds light on the role of flexibility in queuing network and lot-sizing models of production.
