### Abstract:
Expert database systems combine database and expert systems technologies to support the effective management of both rules and data. This paper studies rule processing strategies in expert database systems involving rules that are conditional on joins of relational data. Auxiliary constructs for processing join rules are proposed, and a framework of join rule processing strategies is developed. Cost functions of several strategies are derived based on a stochastic model that characterizes the arrival processes of transactions and queries to the database. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed data constructs and strategies provide an effective method for processing rules.

## 2. Explaining Organizational Diseconomies of Scale in R&D: Agency Problems and the Allocation of Engineering Talent, Ideas, and Effort by Firm Size
### Author(s):
- Todd R. Zenger
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
The comparative efficiency and success of small firms in R&D remains largely unexplained. This paper empirically examines scale diseconomies in offering employment contracts as an explanation for diseconomies of scale in R&D. The paper argues that small firms more efficiently resolve the severe agency problems of hidden information and hidden behavior in R&D. Small firms more efficiently offer contracts that reward performance than large firms, and consequently, small firms attract and retain engineers with higher ability and skill. Further, small firms through these more performance-contingent contracts induce higher levels of effort than large firms. The study tests and generally confirms these hypotheses using data collected from 912 current and former engineering employees of two large high-technology companies.

## 3. Buyers' Pricing Behavior for Risky Alternatives: Encoding Processes and Preference Reversals
### Author(s):
- Jeff T. Casey
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
Numerous studies have examined individuals' minimum selling prices or certainty equivalents for lotteries as measures of preference, but few have examined maximum buying prices. Because every transaction involves a buyer as well as a seller, buyers' pricing behavior is of interest in its own right. Two prospect theory based descriptive models of maximum buying pricesthe integration and segregation modelsare developed from different assumptions about cognitive encoding processes. The models were tested experimentally using an incentive-compatible cash payoff scheme in which maximum buying prices for bets and choices between bets were elicited from subjects. Surprisingly, observed maximum buying prices were far below expected values even for bets with probabilities of winning near 1.0. This suggests buyers are strongly influenced by loss aversion and that the conventional assumption that the buying price for a risky alternative is a reduction in the alternative's payoffs fails to describe behavior. Instead, it appears subjects predominately employed a segregation encoding process in which the buying price was encoded separately from the bet's payoffs and treated as a sure loss. However, an additional result was not explained adequately by either encoding model: Buying prices were less risk averse than choices for $3 expected value betscreating preference reversals of the standard kind (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971)but more risk averse for $100 expected value betscreating reverse preference reversals (Casey 1991). Implications for the scale compatibility principle (Tversky et al. 1988) are discussed. Two theoretical approaches are outlined which offer promise in the development of a unified model of price judgments and choice preferences under risk.

## 4. When Mean Square Error Becomes Variance: A Comment on Business Risk and Return: A Test of Simultaneous Relationships
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
- Robert R. Wiggins
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
In a recent article, Oviatt and Bauerschmidt (1991) investigated risk-return relationship by employing the square root of the mean square error of returns as a measure of risk and found no significant relationship existed in those terms. Ruefli (1991) has suggested that under the assumption of stable distributions there is the possibility of spurious correlation in estimating the risk-return relationship in mean-variance terms. This comment identifies the commonalities between mean square error and variance measures, shows that the former measure is subject to many of the problems of the latter, and presents further evidence regarding the likelihood of spurious correlation in industry studies of risk and return. The results suggest an alternative and more parsimonious explanation for Oviatt and Bauerschmidt's findings as well as for the findings reported in the wider strategic management research literature.

## 5. Certainty Equivalents for Three-Point Discrete-Distribution Approximations
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Keefer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
Three-point discrete-distribution approximations are often used in decision and risk analyses to represent probability distributions for continuous random variablese.g., as probability nodes in decision or probability trees. Performance evaluations of such approximations have generally been based on their accuracies in estimating moments for the underlying distributions. However, moment-based comparisons for recently proposed approximations have been limited. Moreover, very little research has addressed the accuracies of any such approximations in representing expected utilities or certainty equivalents of the underlying distributions. This is of potential concern since recent research shows three-point discrete-distribution approximations exist that match the first several moments of an underlying distribution exactly while, counterintuitively, approximating its certainty equivalents poorly. This paper compares the best two approximations for estimating means and variances identified in an earlier study with promising approximations proposed more recently. Specifically, it examines how accurately six simple general-purpose three-point approximations represent certainty equivalents for continuous random variables as the level of risk aversion is varied, as well as how accurately they estimate means and variances. The results show that several of these are quite accurate over a variety of test distributions when the level of risk aversion and the characteristics of the distributions are within reasonable bounds. Their robust performance is significant for decision analysis practice.

## 6. Improving Economic Incentives in Hospital Prospective Payment Systems Through Equilibrium Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
Under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) implemented by Medicare in 1983, hospitals are paid a set price for each Medicare patient treated, rather than being reimbursed for the patient's costs as had been done previously. An increasing number of other insurers have adopted a similar method of hospital payment. In these systems, the price, which depends on the patient's Diagnosis Related Group (DRG), is derived from the average cost over all hospitals of all patients in that DRG. We propose an alternative method for setting prices in hospital prospective payment systems, called equilibrium pricing, in which prices are derived from a linear programming model of competitive equilibrium. To evaluate the improvement in incentives associated with equilibrium pricing, we define a measure, called the disincentive index, of the extent to which a set of prices creates economic disincentives to efficient behavior. In the situation in which all hospitals compete in a single market area, we show that equilibrium pricing creates the best possible economic incentives, i.e., by reducing the disincentive index to zero. The analysis is then extended to the more realistic situation where hospitals compete in limited geographical market areas, whereas prices must be uniformly set for a number of such market areas. We prove that, with an appropriate generalization of the disincentive index, equilibrium prices for a single market area are also optimal for multiple market areas. Finally, actual cost and utilization data from hospitals that compete in eastern Massachusetts are used to determine prices and to evaluate the associated disincentive index for a simulated prospective payment system. This empirical study shows a dramatic improvement in the incentives created by equilibrium pricing compared to average-cost pricing.

## 7. Tatonnement Procedures for Linearly Constrained Convex Optimization
### Author(s):
- Markku Kallio
- Seppo Salo
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
The emphasis in this article is to exploit the fact that precision requirements for solutions of most economic models in practice are moderate only. A simple approach is introduced for solving linearly constrained partial equilibrium models based on an iterative scheme similar to the simplex method. It allows large-scale models to be solved, within a practical tolerance, efficiently even in a micro computer environment. Extensions to linearly constrained convex optimization problems are presented. Finally, a set of computational tests on 68 linear programs from the NETLIB library is reported. Comparison of our approach with the simplex method (using MINOS 5.1) and with Karmarkar's algorithm is reported. For moderate precision requirements these preliminary results are highly encouraging.

## 8. An Analysis of the Risk in Discretely Rebalanced Option Hedges and Delta-Based Techniques
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1994
### Abstract:
The stochastic properties of discretely rebalanced option hedges have been studied extensively beginning with Black and Scholes (1973). In each analysis hedges were delta-neutral after rebalancing. We argue that the distributional properties of discretely rebalanced hedges are such that delta-based hedging is not the variance minimizing strategy. This paper obtains analytical expressions for the variance minimizing option hedge ratios. We also evaluate the hedge variance to assess the magnitude of the variance reduction over delta-based hedges. For representative parameter values, we show that systematic departures from delta-based hedges can yield significant reductions in hedge variance even for one day rebalancing intervals.
