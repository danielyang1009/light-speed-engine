## 1. Sticky Information and the Locus of Problem Solving: Implications for Innovation
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
To solve a problem, needed information and problem-solving capabilities must be brought together. Often the information used in technical problem solving is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new locationis, in our terms, sticky. In this paper we explore the impact of information stickiness on the locus of innovation-related problem solving. We find, first, that when sticky information needed by problem solvers is held at one site only, problem solving will be carried out at that locus, other things being equal. Second, when more than one locus of sticky information is called upon by problem solvers, the locus of problem solving may iterate among these sites as problem solving proceeds. When the costs of such iteration are high, then, third, problems that draw upon multiple sites of sticky information will sometimes be task partitioned into subproblems that each draw on only one such locus, and/or, fourth, investments will be made to reduce the stickiness of information at some locations.

## 2. Explaining the Role of User Participation in Information System Use
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
Even though user participation in information system development has long been considered to be a critical factor in achieving system success, research has failed to clearly demonstrate its benefits. This paper proposes user involvement as an intervening variable between user participation and system use. Embedding the constructs of participation and involvement into the theoretical framework of Fishbein and Ajzen, a model is developed and tested in a field study of information system projects. Several key findings emerge from the study. User participation and user involvement represent two distinct constructs, with participation leading to involvement, and involvement mediating the relationship between participation and system use. The critical dimension of user participation is overall responsibility. The role of user participation and involvement is different, depending upon whether system use is mandatory or voluntary.

## 3. Coping with the Loss of Pooling Synergy in Cellular Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
The conversion of a functional layout into a cellular manufacturing system involves the partitioning of several multiserver work centers. The loss of pooling synergy in this process can be significant, and this paper investigates the impact of several measures to overcome the adverse effects on flow time, work-in-process inventory and machine utilization. These can be alleviated to a certain extent through reductions in setup times and lot sizes that has been traditionally emphasized in group technology, but a more concerted effort is required. Analytical models are first utilized to investigate the extent to which these adverse effects can be overcome through (1) reduction in setup time, (2) lot sizing, (3) reduction in the variability of process-times and job arrivals, and, (4) reduction in processing times through productivity improvements, all arising from part family-oriented processing. These insights are verified through a simulation comparison of five cellular manufacturing systems with a functional layout system in which optimal lot sizes, low move times and a part family-oriented scheduling rule are used.

## 4. Contract-Based Motivation for Keeping Records of a Manager's Reporting and Budgeting History
### Author(s):

- Richard A. Young
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the role of the agent's bankruptcy constraints in multiperiod principal-agent models with asymmetric information. Conditions are provided under which commitment to a long-term contract involving N rounds of investment improves upon repetition of N identical single-period contracts. Further, when the agent's reservation wage is sufficiently low the optimal contract is always long term. Keeping records of a manager's history of reporting activity facilitates contracting, since optimal contracts may require a link between past reports and future investments over a duration of two or more periods.

## 5. The Adoption of Corporate Governance Mechanisms: A Test of Competing Diffusion Models
### Author(s):
- N. Venkatraman
- Lawrence Loh
- Jeongsuk Koh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
We develop alternative diffusion models of two corporate governance mechanismsjoint venture and M-form organizational structureusing relevant concepts from the resource-based theory. Using data on joint venture adoption from one homogeneous industry (information technology) sector and employing both linear and nonlinear estimations, we test the explanatory power of the internal-influence model in comparison with a competing model of external-influence. Our empirical results support the internal-influence model in this sector with additional evidence for generalizability provided through a multisector sample of joint venture formation. In contrast, empirical results on the diffusion of M-form structure are more consistent with the external-influence model.

## 6. Efficient Algorithms for Stochastic Dominance Tests Based on Financial Market Data
### Author(s):
- Ronny Aboudi
- Dominique Thon
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
It is known that when the random variables being compared have a uniform probability measure, as is the case when using financial market data, the computation of efficient sets for first- and second-degree dominance can be greatly simplified if majorization conditions are used instead of the dominance definitions. This paper presents an equally efficient technique for third-degree dominance.

## 7. Estimation Methods in Portfolio Selection and the Effectiveness of Short Sales Restrictions: UK Evidence
### Author(s):
- John L. G. Board
- Charles M. S. Sutcliffe
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
Forecasting the mean returns vector and the covariance matrix is a key feature in implementing portfolio theory. The performance of the Bayes-Stein method for forecasting these parameters for use in the Markowitz model (with and without short sales) was compared with that of seven other estimation methods, and three alternative portfolio selection techniques. This paper represents the first large scale empirical investigation of the usefulness of the Bayes-Stein approach using historical data. This data was drawn from the London Stock Exchange. In contrast to earlier studies, the relative performance of Bayes-Stein was mixed. While it produced reasonable estimates of the mean returns vector, there were superior methods, e.g., overall mean, for estimating the covariance matrix when short sales were permitted. When short sales were prohibited, actual portfolio performance was clearly improved, although there was little to choose between the various estimation methods.

## 8. An Option Valuation Analysis of Investment Choices by a Regulated Firm
### Author(s):
- Elizabeth Olmsted Teisberg
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1994
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes a utility power plant construction project using an option pricing model of the value of the capital investment. It includes descriptive factors frequently ignored in the valuation of capital investments by regulated firms, including lead time, lumpy and sequential cost outlays, irreversibility of expenditures, and uncertainty about regulatory outcomes for completed projects. The analysis shows the value of shorter lead time technologies, the value of flexibility to delay or abandon construction, the incentive to delay construction under uncertain regulation, and how cost recovery policies, such as possible disallowance of Allow for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC), create incentives to invest less, but to complete construction quickly. The analysis may also apply in unregulated contexts, where the value of a completed project is affected by taxation, the possibility of nationalization, or possible competitors' actions that create uncertain restrictions on potential profits.
