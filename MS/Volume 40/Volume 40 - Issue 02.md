### Abstract:
Regulators of utilities that operate as local monopolies would like to set prices or allow rates of return based upon the quality of a utility's service. However, quality is highly multidimensional. Traditionally, regulators have collected measures of quality on many separate dimensions, and compared performance on these dimensions to explicit pass-fail standards. They have lacked a method of combining complex patterns of substandard and superstandard performance on these many dimensions to arrive at an overall evaluation of the quality of service. To redress this problem, we first describe the information processing problems regulators encounter when they attempt to integrate this complex array of information intuitively, and the problems that arise when the link between service quality (as reflected in patterns of passed and failed standards) and regulatory incentives is not made explicit to utility management. We develop a bootstrapped method for formalizing each expert regulator's evaluation policy using hierarchical conjoint analysis, and apply this method to the evaluation of local telephone companies by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC). We show that experts within the FPSC, the regulated utilities, and a large telephone customer exhibit very high agreement about how the various dimensions of quality should be differentially weighted. We derive a consensus measure of overall quality, Q, and identify a score associated with meeting all standards exactly, Q*. Utilities can then be rewarded based upon whether or not they exceed Q*, rather than on the basis of how many standards are met. Compared with a pattern in which each standard is met exactly, there exist patterns of mixed substandard and superstandard performance on the individual dimensions of quality that are less costly to produce and higher in overall quality. We compare utility incentives when rewards are based upon Q to those under the current pass-fail regime.

## 2. Dynamic Optimal Control Models in Advertising: Recent Developments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1994
### Abstract:
This paper presents a review of recent developments that have taken place in the area of dynamic optimal control models in advertising subsequent to the comprehensive survey of the literature by Sethi in 1977. The basic problem underlying these models is that of determining optimal advertising expenditures and possibly other variables of interest over time for a firm or a group of competing firms under consideration. This optimization is done subject to some dynamics that define how these variables translate into sales and in turn, into profits. The purpose of this update is twofold. On the one hand, new contributions in the areas already treated in the earlier survey are reviewed. On the other hand, new trends in the advertising literature since 1977, such as quality as an additional marketing instrument, cumulative sales models, pulsing advertising, and advertising as a part of corporate models of the firm, are discussed. The models covered in this update are organized under six headings: models with capital stocks generated by advertising, price, and quality, sales-advertising response models, cumulative sales models for durable goods, models with more than one state variables in the advertising process, models incorporating interaction with other functional areas, and competitive models. The discussion involves specifications, methods used, results, empirical validation, if any, and their economic significance. The survey concludes with suggestions for extensions and future directions of research.

## 3. Fortune Favors the Prepared Firm
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1994
### Abstract:
A critical factor in industrial competitiveness is the ability of firms to exploit new technological developments. We term this ability a firm's absorptive capacity and argue that such a capability not only enables a firm to exploit new extramural knowledge, but to predict more accurately the nature of future technological advances. We develop a stylized model in which we focus exclusively on firms' decisions to invest in their absorptive capacities. We first examine a monopolist's investment decision, analyzing the path dependence of its investment and the effect of uncertainty. We then consider the effect of competition by modeling the impact of entry on an incumbent's investment behavior. Implications for management and public policy are then discussed.

## 4. Do People Rely on the Self-Interested Maximization of Others? An Experimental Test
### Author(s):
- T. Randolph Beard
- Richard O. Beil
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1994
### Abstract:
The assumption that agents engage in maximizing behavior, while ubiquitous in economic theory, differs from the assumption that agents are willing to rely on the maximizing behavior of others. This paper offers an empirical examination of this distinction using experimental methods. Utilizing a series of experimental treatments based on a simple, two player extensive form game of perfect information, we find strong evidence that apparently rational people are often unwilling to rely on the self-interested behavior of others, despite the observed near universality of maximizing play.

## 5. What Common Ground Exists for Descriptive, Prescriptive, and Normative Utility Theories?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1994
### Abstract:
Descriptive and normative modeling of decision making under risk and uncertainty have grown apart over the past decade. Psychological models attempt to accommodate the numerous violations of rationality axioms, including independence and transitivity. Meanwhile, normatively oriented decision analysts continue to insist on the applied usefulness of the subjective expected utility (SEU) model. As this gap has widened, two facts have remained largely unobserved. First, most people in real situations attempt to behave in accord with the most basic rationality principles, even though they are likely to fail in more complex situations. Second, the SEU model is likely to provide consistent and rational answers to decision problems within a given problem structure, but may not be invariant across structures. Thus, people may be more rational than the psychological literature gives them credit for, and applications of the SEU model may be susceptible to some violations of invariance principles.

## 6. Multiple-Shift Workforce Scheduling Under the 34 Workweek with Different Weekday and Weekend Labor Requirements
### Author(s):
- Rudy Hung
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1994
### Abstract:
Novel workweek arrangements have gained acceptance in many seven-days-a-week operations, such as hospitals and data processing centers. This note considers a multiple-shift workforce scheduling scenario for seven-days-a-week operations under a workweek arrangement called the 34 workweek. Our model seeks to minimize the workforce size subject to satisfying staffing requirements and workrules relating to off-days, off-weekends, and work-stretches. We provide an efficient optimal algorithm which is intuitive and simple enough to be implemented by hand.
