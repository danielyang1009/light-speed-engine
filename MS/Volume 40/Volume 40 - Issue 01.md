## 1. Is Management Science International: In Search of Universal Rules
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
In management science, as in all of science, a fundamental issue is the generalizability of what we know. It is a never-ending quest to discover and create knowledge and rules which are universal. Yet, frequently what we hold to be universal is quite specific when examined with scientific scrutiny. In this special issue of Management Science we want to develop more precisely the dimension and the extent to which what we know in management science is generalizable, e.g., is our knowledge about managing universal or specific? Is our knowledge limited to a particular firm, an industry, a given country, or a culture? The universality/specificity issue remains a dilemma. The theme of this special issue is the generalizability of management science. Management Science publishes research on theory, methodology and empirical results.

## 2. Management Scientists Are Human
### Author(s):
- Geert Hofstede
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
The culture of the national environment in which an organization operates affects the management process through the collective mental programming of its members, its managers, and the management scientists who offer their theories. Four dimensions of national culture differences have been found. Among other things, they affect the implicit models in people's minds of what the act of organizing means. Among the pioneers in management science around 1900, differences along these dimensions are already noticeable. A fifth dimension was added when the research instrument used was designed exclusively by Chinese scholars, and it provides a cultural explanation for the economic success of East Asian countries in the past quarter century. At the same time, it highlights the influence of the culture of the management scientist on the research questions and the resulting theories.

## 3. Components of Culture: Nature, Interconnections, and Relevance to the Decisions on the Organization Structure
### Author(s):
- Helmy H. Baligh
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
Culture is defined in terms of components and parts. The logical nature of the components and of the connections between them are identified and analyzed. These connections are used as a basis for the argument that there is a meaningful concept of the fit between the components of the organization structure and those of its cultural setting. This concept of fit is defined and the values it may logically take are identified. A theory on the goodness and badness of fit between structure components and culture components is discussed and two of its many pieces are developed in detail.

## 4. When Can Management Science Research Be Generalized Internationally?
### Author(s):
- Philip M. Rosenzweig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
Discussion about international generalizability has rarely addressed the full scope of management science research. This paper identifies a number of obstacles to international generalizability, and shows how they affect technical systems research and social systems research in different ways. Examples of management science research are examined critically for their validity elsewhere in the world. Implications are discussed for the interpretation of existing research and for the design of research.

## 5. Analyzing Cross-National Management and Organizations: A Theoretical Framework
### Author(s):
- Ran Lachman
- Albert Nedd
- Bob Hinings
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
The differential social control embedded in core and periphery values indigenous to a cultural setting, and the availability of resources in that setting, are discussed as critical factors for the effective adaptation of organizations and management practices transferred across cultural boundaries. The relationships between these factors and organizational structure, processes, and behavior, are analyzed and specified in a theoretical framework. The framework postulates the importance of congruent or, at least, accommodative relationships between the core values dominating the local setting, and those underlying transferred practices for the effectiveness of imported organizational practices. Four main contingencies of local-imported values' incongruence are described, and their implications for entry and coping strategies of cross-national organizations are discussed. The framework also offers a scheme for generating hypotheses regarding the effects of values on structures and behavior in cross-national organizations. The theoretical and managerial implications of the scheme are discussed and illustrated.

## 6. Paradoxes of Organizational Theory and Research: Using the Case of China to Illustrate National Contingency
### Author(s):
- Oded Shenkar
- Mary Ann von Glinow
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
Chinese organizations are used in this paper to assess the universality of the macro and micro theories of organization that have been largely developed in North America. The analysis suggests that the theories vary in their degree of applicability to the Chinese context. While some theories, such as population ecology, seem to be clearly inapplicable, others, such as the equity theory of motivation, are more suitable, though they all require significant adjustment before they can be used to study and interpret the structure and processes of Chinese enterprises, and the attitudes and behavior of those employed in them. Making the adjustment, however, is likely to lead to positive developments in organizational theory.

## 7. Explorations of Negotiation Behaviors in Ten Foreign Cultures Using a Model Developed in the United States
### Author(s):
- John L. Graham
- Alma T. Mintu
- Waymond Rodgers
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
The universality of a problem-solving model of business negotiations is explored using 700 business people from 11 cultures as participants in a bargaining simulation. Both theoretical and measurement issues are considered using structural equations and partial least squares as the primary data analysis approaches. The results regarding the universality question are equivocalfindings varied across cultural groups in most cases. However, the theoretical model still appears to be a useful tool for understanding how business negotiations vary across cultural groups.

## 8. Interunit Communication in Multinational Corporations
### Author(s):
- Sumantra Ghoshal
- Harry Korine
- Gabriel Szulanski
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper we investigate some of the organizational factors that influence subsidiary-headquarters and intersubsidiary communication in multinational companies. Our study is based on data collected from 164 senior managers working in 14 different national subsidiaries within the consumer electronics division of Matsushita, a Japanese company, and 84 senior managers working in nine different national subsidiaries within the same business of N.V. Philips, the Holland-based competitor of Matsushita. We show that while subsidiary autonomy has no discernable influence on interunit communication, interpersonal relationships developed through lateral networking mechanisms such as joint work in teams, taskforces, and meetings have significant positive effects on the frequency of both subsidiary-headquarters and intersubsidiary communication. The findings are consistent in the two companies, one Japanese and the other European, and the underlying theoretical propositions appear applicable across borders.

## 9. Cross-National Laws and Differences in Market Response
### Author(s):
- John U. Farley
- Donald R. Lehmann
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
International differences in general, and cultural differences in particular, exert profound influence on what people buy. In modeling market response, highly visible international differences in purchase behavior seem to lead to an assumption by management scientists that there are large parallel international differences in market response to such things as price and advertising. In an interpretive review of market response models, we do find international differences in response parameters, but we also find that parameter differences due to cross-national factors tend to be smaller than differences related to technical characteristics of the model or to product/market specifics. We suggest two new intermediate categories of generalizability between the extremes of everything is the same and everything is different. We also argue that one promising approach to international generalization is through appropriate statistical adjustment of parameters from existing models.

## 10. Operating Flexibility, Global Manufacturing, and the Option Value of a Multinational Network
### Author(s):
- Bruce Kogut
- Nalin Kulatilaka
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
The multinational corporation is a network of activities located in different countries. The value of this network derives from the opportunity to benefit from uncertainty through the coordination of subsidiaries which are geographically dispersed. We model this coordination as the operating flexibility to shift production between two manufacturing plants located in different countries. A stochastic dynamic programming model treats explicitly this flexibility as equivalent to owning an option, the value of which is dependent upon the real exchange rate. The model is extended to analyze hysteresis effects and within-country growth options. We show that the management of across-border coordination has led to changes in the heuristic rules used for performance evaluation and transfer pricing.

## 11. International Diversification of Investment Portfolios: U.S. and Japanese Perspectives
### Author(s):
- Cheol S. Eun
- Bruce G. Resnick
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze the gains from international diversification of investment portfolios from the Japanese as well as the U.S. perspectives. The major findings of this paper include: First, the potential gains from international, as opposed to purely domestic, diversification are much greater for U.S. investors than for Japanese investors. For U.S. investors, the gains accrue not so much in terms of lower risk as in terms of higher return, and the opposite holds for Japanese investors. Second, using various ex ante international investment strategies designed to control parameter uncertainty, U.S. investors can realize substantial gains from international diversification in out-of-sample periods. Japanese investors, however, can gain relatively little. Third, hedging exchange risk generally allows the U.S., but not Japanese, investors to benefit more from international diversification. For U.S. investors, the international bond diversification with exchange risk hedging offers a superior risk-return trade-off than the international stock diversification, with or without hedging.

## 12. Notes: On the Concept of Universal Knowledge in Organizational Science: Implications for Cross-National Research
### Author(s):
- Joseph L. C. Cheng
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1994
### Abstract:
This paper argues that the present conception of universal knowledge as generalized findings is incomplete and has limited the role of cross-national research to one of validating results obtained from single-nation studies. An alternative view is proposed which recognizes that there are two types of research findings that can be applied cross-nationally: (1) findings that are invariant across different national settings, and (2) findings that incorporate the societal context into the analysis of the phenomenon under study. This conception of universal knowledge is more inclusive in scope and suggests an expanded role for cross-national research in organizational inquiry. The new role will offer exciting opportunities for the field of organizational science, including its enhanced ability to discover knowledge that has both universal applicability and global relevance.
