## 1. Evaluating Probabilities: Asymmetric Scoring Rules
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Winkler
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Proper scoring rules are over evaluation measures that reward accurate probabilities Specific rules encountered in the literature and used in practice are invariably symmetric in the sense that the expected score for a perfectly-calibrated probability assessor (or model generating probabilities) is minimized at a probability of one-half. A family of asymmetric scoring rules that provide better measures of the degree of skill inherent in the probabilities and render scores that are more comparable in different situations is developed here. One member of this family, a quadratic asymmetric rule, is applied to evaluate an extensive set of precipitation probability forecasts from the U.S. National Weather Service. Connections to previous characterizations of proper scoring rules are investigated, and some relevant issues pertaining to the design of specific asymmetric rules for particular inferential and decision-making problems are discussed briefly.

## 2. Productivity and Information Technology: The Elusive Connection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
This study analyzes the effect of information technology on the efficiency of production operations in a specific manufacturing process. Survey data from 584 establishments engaged in the machining process in 21 different industries are used to construct and test an empirical model that takes into account product characteristics, the type of technology (computer-programmable automation or conventionally controlled) machines, the extent of technological change at the plant, process-specific characteristics such as the scale of operations and degree of customization, labor policies, and structural features of the organization of work. The results indicate that there is a significant efficiency advantage from using programmable automation technology and that technological advantages accumulate with experience and with the repeated opportunities for learning associated with large volume and frequent product changes. The most efficient use of this technology occurs in plants with work practices that involve a higher ratio of machines to workers (as in a cellular approach to manufacturing) and allow production workers to perform programming tasks to a greater degree. Unionized plants are also significantly more efficient than non-union plants.

## 3. Lower Bounds for Multi-Echelon Stochastic Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
We establish lower bounds on the minimum cost of managing certain production-distribution networks with setup costs at all stages and stochastic demands. These networks include serial, assembly, and one-warehouse multi-retailer systems. We obtain the bounds through novel cost-allocation schemes. We evaluate the bounds' performance for one-warehouse multi-retailer systems by comparing them with simple, heuristic policies. The bounds are quite tight for systems with a small number of retailers. We also present simplified proof of known optimality results for serial and assembly systems.

## 4. Flexibility Ratios and Manufacturing Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
In this exploratory, empirical study of modernizing durable goods plants, it was found that typical measures of flexibility (e.g., number of unique parts and part families) are independent. More importantly, plants and firms with greater strategic manufacturing focus, regardless of specific emphasis (e.g., cost or quality), scheduled fewer part numbers on new flexible automation systems. This suggests that product focus and strategic focus are related in plants producing discrete parts. When flexibility is emphasized as a strategic manufacturing focus, new automation systems are significantly more likely to have shorter change-over times per part family. In general, part family-changeover time ratios appear to have the greatest potential of measures evaluated for building a useful theory of flexibility in discrete parts manufacturing. An evaluation of changes made in part types and part families during the implementation period showed that product flexibility is pursued as a way to reduce high labor costs in manufacturing. These plants accomplished this end by increasing the number of parts scheduled on new systems. Implications for strategic management of flexibility and scope are presented.

## 5. A Heuristic Scheduling Policy for Multi-Item, Multi-Machine Production Systems with Time-Varying, Stochastic Demands
### Author(s):

- Robert C. Leachman

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
An effective scheduling policy known as the Dynamic Cycle Lengths Heuristic was introduced by Leachman and Gascon in 1988 for the multi-item, single-machine production system facing stochastic, time-varying demands. In this article we develop a heuristic scheduling policy for the multi-machine extension of the same problem. We integrate the concepts of the Dynamic Cycle Lengths Heuristic with a nonlinear integer optimization model to obtain an overall scheduling policy that allocates items to machines and schedules production quantities during the next time period. We report promising performance in limited simulation tests of the policy.

## 6. Design for Synchronized Flow Manufacturing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Firms that build flexibility into their manufacturing system gain a competitive edge from their ability to efficiently produce a mid-variety of products at mid-volumes. In order to realize the competitive edge of flexible systems, manufacturing management has to deal effectively with the greater complexity that flexibility brings about. One of the key factors for the success of a flexible system is the management of the product set flow. If the product flow is poorly managed, products may have long manufacturing lead times, and materials may spend a large amount of time in queues as work in process. In such a situation, most of the competitive potential of the flexible system may be lost. But if the flow of materials through the production/assembly stations is carefully synchronized, with materials moving smoothly and continuously from one operation to the next, then it is possible to attain short manufacturing lead times and little waiting. We refer to this operating condition as synchronized flow. In this paper, we study how to attain a synchronized flow for product sets with different characteristics regarding process flexibility and consistency.

## 7. Competitive Market Structures: A Subset Selection Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Market structure models are used to identify submarkets or to test for the presence of submarkets where within-group competition is much stronger than across group competition. The implicit assumption in such models is that the brands in a submarket compete on the basis of their shared product features. However, if significant variety-seeking effect exist in the market, such an assumption may not be valid. We present a model based on a subset selection procedure for analyzing competitive market structures and develop tests of significance for variety-seeking effects present in the market. For each brand in the market, the subset selection procedure identifies sets (submarkets) of brands that are in close competition. The competitive market structure is defined by the possibly overlapping submarkets that are identified for each brand and the model provides insights on whether the brands in a submarket are of a reinforcing or a variety-seeking kind. The application of our model to two different consumer packaged goods markets highlights its contribution relative to extant methods.

## 8. A Parametric Analysis of a Constrained Nonlinear Inventory-production Model
### Author(s):
- Antoine Gautier
- Frieda Granot
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
We discuss in this paper some inventory-production models which can be formulated as nonlinear parametric network flow problems with one additional linear constraint. Several sensitivity analysis questions are addressed. The qualitative sensitivity results obtained provide the manager with insight to understanding qualitatively how to respond to changes in the environment such as production costs, inventory capacity, external demand, machine break-down, strike, or variations in inventory carrying cost without additional computation.

## 9. Stimulating Ideas Through Creative Software
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. MacCrimmon

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
A central task of management is decision making and a crucial aspect of decision making is having good alternatives from which to choose. This paper investigates whether computer-based procedures for idea generation can help individuals to develop solution alternatives more creatively. Our conceptual framework considers creative processes, environments, outputs, and individuals. In particular, generating alternatives is viewed as a process of making connections internal connections among problem elements and external connections between a problem and its environment. We have developed a computer program (GENI) which incorporates a variety of techniques to assist in making these different types of connections. The program is described and an experimental test with several managerial problems is presented. The results show that use of the program leads to the development of significantly more creative alternatives than does a control treatment. There is an amplification effect in that the performance of the more creative individuals is improved the most. Thus the findings suggest that computerized idea generation leads to more creative alternatives resulting in potentially better managerial decisions.

## 10. Clustering for the Design of SONET Rings in Interoffice Telecommunications
### Author(s):
- Manuel Laguna
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Optical fiber systems play an essential role in today's telecommunications networks. The recently standardized SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) technology has made rings the preferred architecture for designing survivable networks. The network design problem is very complex in nature, because it involves not only the configuration of rings at the logical level, but also the mapping of this configuration into physical fiber paths. This paper deals with the problem of finding optimal clusters of offices, which can be used as the basis for designing logical rings. A mathematical model of the problem is presented, and a heuristic solution based on the tabu search framework is developed to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

## 11. Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Discrete Multiple Criteria Decision Making Problems
### Author(s):
- Behnam Malakooti
- Ying Q. Zhou
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Decision making involves choosing some course of action among various alternatives. In almost all decision making problems, there are several criteria for judging possible alternatives. The main concern of the Decision Maker (DM) is to fulfill his conflicting goals while satisfying the constraints of the system. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (AF-ANN) approach to solve discrete Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. The AF-ANN is used to capture and represent the DM's preferences and then to select the most desirable alternative. The AF-ANN can adjust and improve its representation as more information from the DM becomes available.

## 12. Stochastic Optimization by Simulation: Convergence Proofs for the GI/G/1 Queue in Steady-State
### Author(s):
- Pierre L'Ecuyer
- Peter W. Glynn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1994
### Abstract:
Approaches like finite differences with common random numbers, infinitesimal perturbation analysis, and the likelihood ratio method have drawn a great deal of attention recently as ways of estimating the gradient of a performance measure with respect to continuous parameters in a dynamic stochastic system. In this paper, we study the use of such estimators in stochastic approximation algorithms, to perform so-called single-run optimizations of steady-state systems. Under mild conditions, for an objective function that involves the mean system time in a GI/G/1 queue, we prove that many variant of these algorithms converge to the minimizer. In most cases, however, the simulation length must be increased from iteration to iteration, otherwise the algorithm may converge to the wrong value. One exception is a particular implementation of infinitesimal perturbation analysis, for which the single-run optimization converges to the optimum even with a fixed (and small) number of ends of service per iteration. As a by-product of our convergence proofs, we obtain some properties of the derivative estimators that could be of independent interest. Our analysis exploits the regenerative structure of the system, but our derivative estimation and optimization algorithms do not always take advantage of that regenerative structure. In a companion paper, we report numerical experiments with an M/M/1 queue, which illustrate the basis convergence properties and possible pitfalls of the various techniques.
