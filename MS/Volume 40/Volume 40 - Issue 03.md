### Author(s):
- Jeffrey G. Miller
- Aleda V. Roth
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
This paper describes the development and analysis of a numerical taxonomy of manufacturing strategies. The taxonomy was developed with standard methods of cluster analysis, and is based on the relative importance attached to eleven competitive capabilities defining the manufacturing task of 164 large American manufacturing business units.

## 2. Parallel Replacement under Capital Rationing Constraints

### Published:

### Abstract:
Contrary to serial replacement, parallel replacement problems require a decision maker to evaluate a portfolio of replacement decisions in each time period because of economic interdependencies among assets. In this paper, we describe a parallel replacement problem in which the economic interdependence among assets is caused by capital rationing. The research was motivated by the experience gained from a vehicle fleet replacement study where solutions to serial replacement problems could not be implemented since they violated management's budget plan. When firms use budgets to control their expenditures, competition for the limited funds creates interdependent problems. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a zero-one integer program and develop a branch-and-bound algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation methodology. A multiplier adjustment method is developed to solve one Lagrangian dual.

## 3. A Periodic Review, Production Planning Model with Uncertain Capacity and Uncertain DemandOptimality of Extended Myopic Policies

### Published:

### Abstract:
Increasing product complexity, manufacturing environment complexity and an increased emphasis on product quality are all factors leading to uncertainties in production processes. These uncertainties are in the form of unplanned machine maintenance, varying production yields and rework, among others. In planning for production, an adequate model must incorporate these uncertainties into the representation of the production process.

## 4. Importance Sampling for the Simulation of Highly Reliable Markovian Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper we investigate importance sampling techniques for the simulation of Markovian systems with highly reliable components. The need for simulation arises because the state space of such systems is typically huge, making numerical computation inefficient. Naive simulation is inefficient due to the rarity of the system failure events. Failure biasing is a useful importance sampling technique for the simulation of such systems. However, until now, this technique has been largely heuristic. We present a mathematical framework for the study of failure biasing. Using this framework we derive variance reduction results which explain the orders of magnitude of variance reduction obtained in practice. We show that in many cases the magnitude of the variance reduction is such that the relative errors of the estimates remain bounded as the failure rates of components tend to zero. We also prove that the failure biasing heuristic in its original form may not give bounded relative error for a large class of systems and that a modification of the heuristic works for the general case. The theoretical results in this paper agree with experiments on the subject which have been reported in a previous paper.

## 5. Economic Development of Groundwater in Arid Zones with Applications to the Negev Desert, Israel
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
A mixed binary integer linear program is formulated to determine the economic development of marginal groundwater sources at local demand sites in an arid region. These marginal sources are required to augment the supply from an overloaded regional source. The model accounts for variable costs of supply, fixed investment costs, capacity constraints at the regional and local levels, and water quality requirements at the local sites. A Lagrangian relaxation reduces the model to a series of simple local problems, the solution of which provides an optimal sequence for developing the marginal groundwater sources while reducing the demands on the regional source. A heuristic and an exact procedure are also proposed to solve the problem for arbitrary levels of supply from the regional source. The exact procedure uses characteristics of the optimal solution to reduce the model to a series of knapsack-type problems. The theory is applied to a small case study taken from the Negev Desert in southern Israel.

## 6. Modeling Competitive Bidding: A Critical Essay
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
In analyzing bidding, modeling matters. This paper is a critical analysis of the models available to aid competitive bidding decision makingbidding strategy and auction designin real transactions. After an introductory overview, this paper describes the contexts in which auctions arise, reviews the mainstream theory of single, isolated auctions and discusses the important work involved in enrichment of this theory. In doing so, it indicates results that have been obtained and the sort of changes in analytical approach that are needed to tackle other critical enrichments. The paper summarizes briefly what is known about the direct use of models by bidders and auction designers. A general theme of this paper is that enriched models are needed to bring bidding theory closer to direct applicability in decision making.

## 7. Investment Strategies under Transaction Costs: The Finite Horizon Case
### Author(s):
- Gerard Gennotte
- Alan Jung
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
We examine the effect of proportional transaction costs on dynamic portfolio strategies for an agent who maximizes his expected utility of terminal wealth. For portfolios composed of a single risky asset and a single riskless asset, Constantinides (1979) shows that the optimal investment policy is described in terms of a no transaction region, where the optimal policy is to refrain from trading if initial portfolio holdings lie within the region, and to transact to the nearest boundary of the region if portfolio holdings lie outside the region. Because the boundaries could not be derived analytically, we developed an efficient and tractable algorithm to obtain the boundaries, which are expressed as the ratio of the dollar holdings in stocks and bonds. We considered two cases: the same transaction costs for the two assets, and costs incurred on only the risky asset. We derived the optimal trading strategies and utility levels for a large set of realistic parameters. In particular, we show that the no transaction region narrows and converges rapidly to the infinite horizon limit as the time horizon increases.

## 8. A Disaggregate Negative Binomial Regression Procedure for Count Data Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
Various research areas face the methodological problems presented by nonnegative integer count data drawn from heterogeneous populations. We present a disaggregate negative binomial regression procedure for analysis of count data observed for a heterogeneous sample of cross-sections, possibly over some fixed time periods. This procedure simultaneously pools or groups cross-sections while estimating a separate negative binomial regression model for each group. An E-M algorithm is described within a maximum likelihood framework to estimate the group proportions, the group-specific regression coefficients, and the degree of overdispersion in event rates within each derived group. The proposed procedure is illustrated with count data entailing nonnegative integer counts of purchases (events) for a frequently bought consumer good.

## 9. Transient Analysis of a Two-Unit Standby System with Markovian Degrading Units
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1994
### Abstract:
A two-unit cold standby system with Markovian degrading units and one repair facility is considered. Two types of repair are possible: preventive and corrective, where the latter is supposed to be more time consuming than the first. The system is controlled by a repair policy of control limit type: a preventive repair on the working unit is carried out as soon as the state of this unit exceeds a certain threshold unless the repair facility is occupied by the other unit. In this paper we derive explicit expressions for the Laplace transforms of the up- and down-periods of this system, which provide insight in the availability of the system and which can be used to obtain approximations for the interval availability distribution. An iterative numerical procedure is presented for the special case of generalized Erlangian distributed repair times.
