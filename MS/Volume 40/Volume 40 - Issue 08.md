### Abstract:
Learning is often perceived as a cost-reducing endogenous by-product of production processes. In many applications this by-product is modeled as a learning curve; that is, a simple function of time or of cumulative production experience. In an earlier paper we presented an alternative explanation where managers decide what resources to devote to knowledge acquisition. In this paper we expand those results to a situation using a more flexible production technology and emphasizing discounted cost. Our model explains resource and output behavior for a firm that is producing specialized units to contractual order. However, the results are quite general and have implications for investment in research, engineering, science and technology, software development, and worker training. We provide examples where the cost-minimizing producer will choose to invest in knowledge creation early in the production program and then have the rate of investment decline over time. Other interesting results are noted by examining the optimal time paths of the control and state variables in a comparative dynamic analysis.

## 2. Incentive Efficient Production Frontiers: An Agency Perspective on DEA
### Author(s):
- Peter Bogetoft
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper, we examine how empirical production frontiers may contribute to the incentives of production units. We consider a series of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) frontiers, and we show when these may be incentive efficient in the sense that they contain all the information that are relevant for optimal incentive provision. The frontiers considered include the so-called constant, decreasing and varying return to scale models, the free disposability and the free replicability models, as well as the increasing and decreasing return to scale models based on a relaxed set of assumptions. Also, we illustrate how to design optimal incentive schemes based on such frontiers.

## 3. Database Allocation in a Distributed Environment: Incorporating a Concurrency Control Mechanism and Queuing Costs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1994
### Abstract:
This research investigates the problem of allocating database fragments across a set of computers connected by a communication network. A mathematical model is presented to aid designers in the development of distributed database systems. The model takes into account the pattern of usage of the databases, communication costs in the network, delays due to queuing of data requests, costs for maintaining consistency among the various copies of a database, and storage costs. A solution procedure based on Lagrangian relaxation is proposed to solve the model. Computational results are reported along with several useful observations. The model is applicable to organizations that are considering migration from a centralized to a distributed computing environment.

## 4. The Growth of Interorganizational Systems in the Presence of Network Externalities

### Abstract:
We develop a model of network growth in the presence of network externalities for the case where a buyer initiates an interorganizational system with its suppliers. In our two-stage model, suppliers joining the network in the first stage can gain economic benefit from increased market share or higher price for the primary product. Suppliers encounter negative externalities since the economic benefit accruing to participating suppliers is less for increasingly larger networks. In the first stage, the buyer may experience initial supplier adoption of the network followed by a stalling problem due to negative externalities. In order to overcome this stalling problem, the buyer may find it optimal to subsidize some suppliers' costs to join the network in the second stage. We characterize the buyer's optimal second stage subsidy policy and show the conditions under which the buyer will find it optimal to offer a subsidy. If the suppliers have some positive ex ante expectation of a second stage subsidy, the growth of the network will be retarded in the first stage resulting in suboptimal profits for the buyer.

## 5. Optimal Dynamic Pricing of Inventories with Stochastic Demand over Finite Horizons
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Gallego
- Garrett van Ryzin
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1994
### Abstract:
In many industries, managers face the problem of selling a given stock of items by a deadline. We investigate the problem of dynamically pricing such inventories when demand is price sensitive and stochastic and the firm's objective is to maximize expected revenues. Examples that fit this framework include retailers selling fashion and seasonal goods and the travel and leisure industry, which markets space such as seats on airline flights, cabins on vacation cruises, and rooms in hotels that become worthless if not sold by a specific time.

## 6. Strategies for Combining Antithetic Variates and Control Variates in Designed Simulation Experiments
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1994
### Abstract:
In this paper we examine three methods for combining the variance reduction techniques of antithetic variates and control variates to estimate the mean response in a designed simulation experiment. In Combined Method I, we perform h independent pairs of simulation runs as followson the second run of each such pair, we use random number streams that are antithetic (complementary) to the streams used on the first run of the pair to drive the non-control-variate components of the simulation model; and we use independent random number streams to drive the control-variate components of the simulation model. In Combined Method II, we also perform h independent pairs of runs; but on each pair of runs we use independent random number streams to drive the non-control-variate model components, and we use antithetic random number streams to drive the control-variate components. In Combined Method III, all of the random number streams driving the second run of each pair of runs are antithetic to the streams driving the first run of the pair. For each of these three methods we drive the variance of the resulting estimator of the mean response to make a theoretical comparison of the efficiency of each method. We implemented these three methods, along with the classical method of control variates, in a simulation model of a resource-constrained activity network to show how each combined method is implemented in practice and to evaluate the performance of each combined method experimentally. The results indicate that: (a) Combined Method III outperformed all other methods, and (b) the effectiveness of Combined Method III as well as the choice of whether to use Combined Method I or Combined Method II depends on the degree of correlation between the control variates and the response.

## 7. Creating Policy Alternatives Using Stakeholder Values
### Author(s):
- Robin Gregory
- Ralph L. Keeney
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1994
### Abstract:
Choices that require multiple stakeholders to balance conflicting objectives are among today's most controversial decisions. Although many techniques exist for helping decision makers to select among projects, little attention has been given to processes for identifying improved alternatives based on clearly articulated stakeholder values. In this paper we describe a general process to inform controversial social decisions by first structuring stakeholder objectives and then using this information to create policy alternatives. We also report the results of a workshop in Sabah, Malaysia which used the proposed approach as the basis for multiple stakeholder negotiations.

## 8. Equipment Selection and Machine Scheduling in General Mail Facilities
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
With the goal of fiscal self-sufficiency, the United States Postal Service (USPS) has embarked upon a 10-year program to modernize, and in some cases radically alter, the way it manages and processes the mail. At the heart of this effort is the goal of automating virtually all of the letter mail by 1995. This means reading, sorting, and then sequencing each mail piece to the order in which it will be delivered by the carrier with only a minimum of manual labor. In support of this goal, a series of long-term planning models has been developed to help select equipment and plan for its use at the more than 250 general mail facilities (GMF) throughout the nation. This paper reports on one of the central studies underlying this effort.
