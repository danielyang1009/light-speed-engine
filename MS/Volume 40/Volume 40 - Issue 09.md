## 1. Information Systems Innovation Among Organizations
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
In an era of revolutionary new developments in basic information technology, innovation in its employment among organizations is increasingly crucial to competitive survival and success. The Information Systems (IS) unit within the business is largely responsible for meeting this challenge. Yet, current theory explains little about IS innovation and its role in organizational innovation in general. We suggest some needed foundations. IS innovations are posited to be of three types: Type I innovations confined to the IS task; Type II innovations supporting administration of the business; and Type III innovations imbedded in the core technology of the business. Diffusion among organizations is conjectured to occur by means of a communication circuit in which each IS unit is linked to its professional and business environments. Systematic differences in adoption and evolution patterns among IS innovation types are expected. Three specific IS innovationsdata administration, the information center, and material requirements planning (MRP)illustrate.

## 2. Meta-Modeling Concepts and Tools for Model Management: A Systems Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
We present a new framework for model management based on system concepts and theory. Underlying the framework is a set of meta-modeling concepts that are useful in capturing the semantics of the modeling process in a modeling environment. These concepts include the notions of a general-model type, type specialization, atomic and composite model versions, model instances, and parameterized versions. We describe these concepts both conceptually and formally and then briefly present a Model Description Language (MDL) that embodies them. While other researchers have suggested some of these concepts primarily in different contexts, this paper makes at least four valuable contributions: (1) the identification of fundamental issues and principles related to model management; (2) the development and enhanced treatment of meta-modeling concepts specifically for model management; (3) the synthesis of those concepts into a coherent, unifying framework for model management; and (4) a demonstration of the practicality of those concepts through a prototype system implementation. Our framework proposes a graph-oriented, nonprocedural, and hierarchical approach for model composition. The framework also supports both model-solver independence and model-data independence. Moreover, it offers general solutions to two critical issues in model management: model-model linkage and model-data linkage. We argue that the system framework can serve as a guide for an effective design of a flexible and extensible model management system. An architecture of such a system and its prototype implementationcalled SYMMSare briefly described. Examples are presented to illustrate the features and advantages of our approach.

## 3. Solving Large-Scale Tour Scheduling Problems

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
For a given planning horizon, workforce composition and set of labor requirements, personnel scheduling often reduces to solving three problems. The first is concerned with the assignment of days off; the second involves assigning workers to shifts during the day; and the third involves the construction of weekly tours. In many manufacturing facilities, tour scheduling is easy because the start and end times of shifts are invariant, and no work takes place on the weekend. But when daily patterns vary, such as in the airlines, processing, and public service industries, and when part-timers make up a portion of the workforce, the complexity of the overall problem increases dramatically.

## 4. Coordinating Buyer-Seller Transactions Across Multiple Products
### Author(s):

- Heungsoo Park
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
Joint ordering policies are examined as a method for reducing the transactions cost for multiple products sold by a seller to a homogeneous group of buyers. The problem of determining efficient joint ordering policies has the same structure as the previously-examined problem of determining the efficient ordering policy for a single product. Efficient joint lot-sizes are independent of prices, and are supported by a range of average-unit prices that permit every possible allocation of the transactions-cost saving between the buyer and the seller. Product bundling supports efficient joint orders across products, just as a quantity discount supports efficient transactions for a single product.

## 5. Modeling Goes to Hollywood: Predicting Individual Differences in Movie Enjoyment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
Consumer behavior researchers are getting more interested in the experiential aspect of consumption, which focuses on the fun and enjoyment that consumers derive from hedonic experiences. We build upon the experiential view of consumer behavior, and present an innovative modeling approach to studying the dynamics of hedonic consumption experiences. We develop a conceptual framework for the enjoyment of a hedonic experience, in which we propose that the enjoyment of the experience is an outcome of the dynamic interaction between stable individual difference factors, temporary moods, and the emotional content of the experience. We present an application of the conceptual framework in the context of a movie viewing experience. We model the interaction between the temporary moods of an individual and the emotional content of the movie as a stochastic process. This interaction determines the individual's instantaneous emotional states. We develop analytical expressions for the dynamic evolution of the probability distribution of the levels of achieved emotional stimulation, and, through individual difference factors, the expected enjoyment. All measurements are taken prior to watching the movie. We use these measurements to predict individual differences in the ex-post enjoyment of the movie. We present an empirical test of the movie enjoyment model (ENJMOD), and find encouraging results at the individual and segment level. We discuss the implications of our modeling approach for the segmentation and testing of movies, and for the prediction of consumer response to similar experiential products.

## 6. Fairness and Social Risk I: Unaggregated Analyses
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
- Rakesh K. Sarin
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
This paper is the first of a two-paper study of fairness issues for decisions that affect the benefits received and the risks encountered by a population. The study examines fairness for individuals and for homogeneous groups within the population. It considers fairness both for population benefit-risk profiles and for probability distributions over profiles that reflect uncertainty about outcomes of decisions.

## 7. Two-Stage Stopping Procedures Based on Standardized Time Series
### Author(s):
- Marvin K. Nakayama
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1994
### Abstract:
We propose some new two-stage stopping procedures to construct absolute-width and relative-width confidence intervals for a simulation estimator of the steady-state mean of a stochastic process. The procedures are based on the method of standardized time series proposed by Schruben and on Stein's two-stage sampling scheme. We prove that our two-stage procedures give rise to asymptotically valid confidence intervals (as the prescribed length of the confidence interval approaches zero and the size of the first stage grows to infinity). The sole assumption required is that the stochastic process satisfy a functional central limit theorem.
