### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
When a product's price fluctuates at a store, how should rational, cost-minimizing shoppers shop for it? Specifically, how frequently should they visit the store, and how much of the product should they buy when they get there? Would this rational shopping behavior differ across Every Day Low Price (EDLP) and Promotional Pricing (HILO) stores? If shoppers are rational, which retail price format is more profitable, EDLP or HILO? To answer these questions, we develop a normative model that shows how rational customers should shop when the price of the product is random.

## 2. Managing Broader Product Lines through Delayed Differentiation Using Vanilla Boxes
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
In an attempt to reduce cost while maintaining good customer service, some of the leading manufacturers in the computer industry are delaying product differentiation (by exploiting component commonality) while managing broader product lines. In an environment where demands are stochastic, it seems a good strategy to store inventory in the form of semi-finished products (vanilla boxes) that can serve more than one final product. However, finding the optimal configurations and inventory levels of the vanilla boxes could be a challenging task. In this paper, we model the above problem as a two-stage integer program with recourse. By utilizing structural decomposition of the problem and (sub)gradient derivative methods, we provide an effective solution procedure. A special case, a variant, and several extensions are also discussed. In our computational section, we utilize our model to study several new research issues. We provide insights on the effect of demand variance, correlation, and capacity limitations on the optimal configuration and inventory levels of vanilla boxes and the performance of a vanilla assembly process. In addition, we compare the performance of the vanilla assembly process to make-to-stock and assemble-to-order processes and provide managerial insights on the conditions under which one might be better than the others. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of an IBM product line (which motivated this work) and the effectiveness of a heuristic tailored for that application.

## 3. The Role of Earnings Information in Corporate Dividend Decisions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper examines the role of earnings information in the determination of dividend policy. We decompose accounting earnings into permanent and transitory components and postulate that dividend policy is driven by sustainable permanent earnings. Two measures of permanent earnings are proposed. The first is a permanent earnings variable extracted from accounting earnings by a random-level shift ARMA model. The second measure is stock price times cost of capital. These two permanent earnings measures are employed in the Marsh-Merton (1987) model to explain corporate dividend behavior and their performance is compared. A generalized friction method is adopted for empirical estimation to account for stepwise dividend movements over time. Results show that the permanent earnings measure extracted from accounting earnings data explains dividend dynamic behavior better than stock price.

## 4. Interfunctional Conflict, Conflict Resolution Styles, and New Product Success: A Four-Culture Comparison
### Author(s):
- Jinhong Xie
- X. Michael Song
- Anne Stringfellow
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model relating innovation success to the level of interfunctional conflict and conflict resolution methods. The model suggests a concave relationship between performance and the level of interfunctional conflict among marketing, R&D, and manufacturing. It also conjectures that both national culture and the level of interfunctional conflict influence the effectiveness of different conflict resolution methods. An empirical test of the proposed framework involves a survey of 968 marketing managers from Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, and Great Britain. The results provide general support for the model's predictions and reveal several significant cross-national differences.

## 5. Strategies for Survival in Fast-Changing Industries
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
Technology strategy variables tend to predominate as predictors of survival in the fast-changing rigid disk drive industry. Building on these previous studies, we here test the hypothesis that the technological and market strategies of a new entrant are highly interrelated and that their joint effect plays an important role in a firm's probability of survival. In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival.

## 6. Echelon Reorder Points, Installation Reorder Points, and the Value of Centralized Demand Information
### Author(s):
- Fangruo Chen
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
We consider a serial inventory system with N stages. The material flows from an outside supplier to stage N, then to stage N  1, etc., and finally to stage 1 where random customer demand arises. Each stage replenishes a stage-specific inventory position according to a stage-specific reorder point/order quantity policy. Two variations of this policy are considered. One is based on echelon stock, and the other installation stock. The former requires centralized demand information, while the latter does not. The relative cost difference between the two policies is called the value of centralized demand information. For fixed order quantities, we develop efficient algorithms for computing both the optimal echelon reorder points and the optimal installation reorder points. These algorithms enable us to conduct an extensive computational study to assess the value of centralized demand information and to understand how this value depends on several key system parameters, i.e., the number of stages, leadtimes, batch sizes, demand variability, and the desired level of customer service.

## 7. An Efficient Procedure for Designing Single Allocation Hub and Spoke Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
Given the widespread use of the hub and spoke network architecture and its growing importance to competitiveness in logistics, communication, and mass transportation, there has been considerable interest by practitioners and researchers alike in finding efficient methods for designing such networks. This paper provides a method that delivers both high quality solutions and firm measures of that quality, and allows problems to be solved in reasonable time on a desktop computer. The approach begins with a previously proposed tight linear programming formulation and uses subgradient optimization on a lagrangian relaxation of the model. However, to dramatically improve the performance of this approach, we augment a subproblem of the lagrangian relaxation model with a cut constraint. In computational experiments on eighty-four standard test problems, average gaps are 0.048%. Maximum gaps are under 1% while average solution times on a Pentium-166 are under five minutes.

## 8. Optimization of (s, S) Inventory Systems with Random Lead Times and a Service Level Constraint
### Author(s):
- Sridhar Bashyam
- Michael C. Fu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
A major assumption in the analysis of (s, S) inventory systems with stochastic lead times is that orders are received in the same sequence as they are placed. Even under this assumption, much of the work to date has focused on the unconstrained optimization of the system, in which a penalty cost for unsatisfied demand is assigned. The literature on constrained optimization, wherein a service level requirement needs to be met, is more sparse. In this paper, we consider the constrained optimization problem, where orders are allowed to cross in time. We propose a feasible directions procedure that is simulation based, and present computational results for a large number of test cases. In the vast majority of cases, we come within 5% of estimated optimality.

## 9. An Application of Copulas to Accident Precursor Analysis
### Author(s):

- Vicki M. Bier
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
Data on accident precursors can help in estimating accident frequencies, since they provide a rich source of information on intersystem dependencies. However, Bayesian analysis of accident precursors requires the ability to construct joint prior distributions reflecting such dependencies. For example, the failure probabilities of a particular safety system under normal and accident conditions, respectively, will generally not be identical (because of the effects of the accident), but will almost certainly be correlated (since both failure probabilities reflect the performance of the same components, with the same inherent levels of reliability). In this paper, we explore the use of copulas (a method of representing joint distribution functions with particular marginals) to construct the needed prior distributions, and then use these distributions in a Bayesian analysis of hypothetical precursor data. This demonstrates the usefulness of copulas in practice. The same approach can also be used in a wide variety of other contexts where joint distributions with particular marginals are desired.

## 10. A Lagrangian Dual-Based Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for the Generalized Multi-Assignment Problem
### Author(s):
- June S. Park
- Byung Ha Lim
- Youngho Lee
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper develops a Lagrangian dual-based branch-and-bound algorithm for the generalized multi-assignment problem (GMAP) which includes the well-known generalized assignment problem (GAP) as a special case. In GMAP, an object may be required to be duplicated in multiple locations. We develop a Lagrangian dual ascent algorithm for GMAP. This dual ascent and the subgradient search each possess advantages that can be combined to develop a new Lagrangian dual search algorithm. The latter algorithm, when incorporated into a branch-and-bound algorithm as the lower bounding scheme, can accelerate the search process. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this branch-and-bound algorithm not only for GMAPs, but for GAPs that are more difficult than could be solved by previous algorithms.
