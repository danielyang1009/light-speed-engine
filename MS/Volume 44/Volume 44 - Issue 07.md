## 1. A Belief-Based Account of Decision Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Craig R. Fox
- Amos Tversky
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
We develop a belief-based account of decision under uncertainty. This model predicts decisions under uncertainty from (i) judgments of probability, which are assumed to satisfy support theory; and (ii) decisions under risk, which are assumed to satisfy prospect theory. In two experiments, subjects evaluated uncertain prospects and assessed the probability of the respective events. Study 1 involved the 1995 professional basketball playoffs; Study 2 involved the movement of economic indicators in a simulated economy. The results of both studies are consistent with the belief-based account, but violate the partition inequality implied by the classical theory of decision under uncertainty.

## 2. Distribution Channels: An Extension of Exclusive Retailership
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The underlying channel structure in most studies to date has consisted either of exclusive dealers that sell only one manufacturer's brand or of a single retailer selling multiple brands. Little attention has been given to the larger segment of most consumer goods markets in which retailers compete to sell multiple brands at the same location. This research seeks to add to the growing literature of channel competition by analyzing three channel structures, the least constrained of which deals with two competing manufacturers and two retailers, each of whom distributes both products in a noncooperative game with two Nash's and one Stackleberg equilibrium. Using differentiated products and a linear demand function, we introduce the concept of store substitutabilitya measure corresponding to product substitutability representing competitiveness at the retail levelbetween the two retailers. We are able to obtain closed form solutions for all cases. We show that the presence of competitive effects at both retail and manufacturer levels of distribution has a significant impact on profits and prices. We also study the effects of various power relationships in the channel. Furthermore, we compare these results to those obtained by previous research. Finally, we propose some testable implications and suggest avenues for future research.

## 3. Toward a Theory of Continuous Improvement and the Learning Curve
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
Continuous improvement (CI) unceasingly strives to improve the performance of production and service firms. The learning curve (LC) provides1988 Department of Industrial Engineering and a means to observe and track that improvement. At present, however, the concepts of CI are abstract and imprecise and the rationale underpinning the LC is obscure. For managers to improve processes effectively, they need a more scientific theory of CI and the LC. This paper begins to develop such a theory. Our approach is based on learning cycles, that is, in each period management takes an action to improve the process, observes the results, and thereby learns how to improve the process further over time. This analysis suggests a differential equation that not only characterizes continuous improvement but also reveals how learning might occur in the learning curve. This differential equation might help management to evaluate the effectiveness of various procedures and to improve and enhance industrial processes more quickly.

## 4. A Portfolio Approach to Risk Reduction in Discretely Rebalanced Option Hedges
### Author(s):
- Antonio S. Mello
- Henrik J. Neuhaus
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
This paper analyses the accumulated hedging errors generated by discretely rebalanced option hedges. We show that simple generalizations of the prior research can underestimate the variance of the accumulated hedging errors and that even with daily rebalancing, these accumulated hedging errors can introduce substantial risk in arbitrage strategies suggested by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We also show that the correlation between the accumulated hedging errors for different options can be quite high, so that the risk of arbitrage due to hedging errors can be substantially reduced by optimally combining options into portfolios. The results also suggest that tests of market pricing of traded options which are based on employing a portfolio approach are likely to be much better specified than the standard tests that focus on individual options.

## 5. Price Promotions and Trade Deals with Multiproduct Retailers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
In this paper we study retail price promotions and manufacturer trade deals in markets with multiproduct retailers. We find that in situations where retailers carry more than one competing brand, the promotions across brands can be positively or negatively correlated depending on the structure of the market: the relative sizes of the various market segments (in terms of loyalty to manufacturer, retailer, or the pair manufacturer-retailer). We show that sometimes retailers offer the same discount on different products, but at other times they offer a smaller discount on a brand supported by a bigger trade deal. We also present results on the effects of changes in the sizes of the different market segments on the depth of price promotions and trade deals and on pass through.

## 6. Optimal Production and Inventory Policy for Multiple Products Under Resource Constraints
### Author(s):
- Gregory A. DeCroix
- Antonio Arreola-Risa
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
We show that a modified base-stock policy is optimal for multiproduct, infinite-horizon production-inventory systems, where demand for the products is random and the products share a finite resource every period. We characterize the optimal policy for the case of homogeneous products. Because of the difficulty in computing the optimal base-stock levels for the heterogeneous case, we propose a heuristic that is simple enough for practical applications. We present numerical results that suggest that the heuristic yields near-optimal solutions.

## 7. Structural Comparison of Data Envelopment Analysis and Multiple Objective Linear Programming
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
The concept of efficiency as it applies to Decision Making Units (DMUs), solutions, alternatives plays an important role both in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP). Despite this and other apparent similarities, DEA and MOLP research has developed separately. We show that structurally the DEA formulation to identify efficient units is quite similar to the MOLP model based on the reference point or the reference direction approach to generate efficient solutions. DEA and MOLP should not be seen as substitutes, but rather as complements. We show that they cross-fertilize each other. MOLP provides interesting extensions to DEA and DEA provides new areas of application to MOLP.

## 8. On Pooling in Queueing Networks
### Author(s):
- Avishai Mandelbaum
- Martin I. Reiman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
We view each station in a Jackson network as a queue of tasks, of a particular type, which are to be processed by the associated specialized server. A complete pooling of queues, into a single queue, and servers, into a single server, gives rise to an M/PH/1 queue, where the server is flexible in the sense that it processes all tasks. We assess the value of complete pooling by comparing the steady-state mean sojourn times of these two systems. The main insight from our analysis is that care must be used in pooling. Sometimes pooling helps, sometimes it hurts, and its effect (good or bad) can be unbounded. Also discussed briefly are alternative pooling scenarios, for example complete pooling of only queues which results in an M/PH/S system, or partial pooling which can be devastating enough to turn a stable Jackson network into an unstable Bramson network. We conclude with some possible future research directions.

## 9. The Analysis of Assumptions in Model Bases Using Metagraphs
### Author(s):
- Amit Basu
- Robert W. Blanning
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
Decision models are often based on certain assumptions as to their validity. Relevant assumptions may include value-based assumptions, such as limitations on the range or values of some input variables or exogenous factors, as well as assumptions about model structure (e.g., linearity). In a model base consisting of many models, there may be several models (or collections of models) that can be used to solve a particular problem. We may wish to know what the applicable models are, what assumptions are associated with these models, and whether a given set of assumptions is necessary and/or sufficient for solving the problem. We describe an analytical approach, based on a graph-theoretic construct called a metagraph, and show how it can be used to represent and analyze assumptions in model bases.

## 10. Survival-Enhancing Learning in the Manhattan Hotel Industry, 18981980
### Author(s):
- Joel A. C. Baum
- Paul Ingram
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
In this study, we examine how experience at the level of the organization, the population, and the related group affects the failure of Manhattan hotels. We find organizational experience has a U-shaped effect on failure; that organizations enjoy reduced failure as a function of population experience before their founding, but not after; and that related organizations provide experience that lowers failure, but it matters whether their experience is local or non-local, and if it was acquired before or after the relationship was established. These results indicate both the difficulty of applying different types of experience to reduce the risk of organizational failure, and the relevance of experience for the evolution of organizational populations.

## 11. Note: How Does Product Proliferation Affect Responsiveness?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1998
### Abstract:
In this note we consider some strategies that a manufacturing firm may use to deal with an increase in the variety of products it offers. We indicate how alternate strategies for dealing with product proliferation impact the firm's responsiveness, measured in terms of average production lead time and average work-in-process inventory. Focusing on the make-to-order environment and using queueing models, we derive conditions under which an increase in product variety can improve both individual product performance as well as system performance, thus contradicting a common belief that a greater degree of focus and greater responsiveness go hand in hand. These queueing models provide operations managers analytical tools for evaluating alternate strategies for coping with product proliferation.
