## 1. Clearance Pricing and Inventory Policies for Retail Chains
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Clearance pricing and end of season inventory management are challenging and important problems in retailing. Sales rates depend upon price, seasonal effects, and the remaining assortment of items available to customers. There is little time to react to observed sales, and pricing errors result in either loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be liquidated. This paper develops optimal clearance prices and inventory management policies that take into account the impact of reduced assortment and seasonal changes on sales rates. Versions of these policies have been tested and implemented at three major retail chains and these applications are summarized and discussed.

## 2. A Mixed Integer Programming Model for Solving a Layout Problem in the Fashion Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
The cutting operation in the high fashion clothing industry essentially involves putting several layers of cloth on a long cutting table and fixing templates of the parts of several articles on top of the stack before the actual cutting can be initiated. This is a very time-consuming task giving raise to high setup costs in addition to waste production resulting from the cutting process. Total production costs can then be optimized by minimizing the number of these setups while at the same time producing little or no waste. In this paper a mixed integer programming model is proposed that searches for an optimal set of cutting patterns, each giving a combination of articles to be cut in one operation, and corresponding stack heights.

## 3. Admission Policies in Loss Queueing Models with Heterogeneous Arrivals
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a loss system where the arrivals can be classified into different groups according to their arrival rate and expected service time. While the standard admission policy consists of rejecting only those customers who arrive when all servers are busy, we address the problem of finding the optimal static admission policy (with respect to a given reward structure) when customers can be discriminated according to the group they belong to, thus customers of some groups might be automatically rejected (even if some servers remain idle) in order to enhance the global efficiency of the system. The optimality of a c-rule is shown, from which finite-time algorithms for the one- and two-server cases are derived.

## 4. Optimal Updating of Forecasts for the Timing of Future Events
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Shumsky
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
A major problem in forecasting is estimating the time of some future event. Traditionally, forecasts are designed to minimize an error cost function that is evaluated once, possibly when the event occurs and forecast accuracy can be determined. However, in many applications forecast error costs accumulate over time, and the forecasts themselves may be updated with information that is collected as the expected time of the event approaches. This paper examines one such application, in which flow control managers in the U.S. air traffic system depend on forecasts of aircraft departure times to predict and alleviate potential congestion. These forecasts are periodically updated until take-off occurs, although the number of updates may be limited by the cost of collecting, processing, and distributing information. The procedures developed in this paper balance the costs of accumulated forecast errors and the costs of forecast updates. The procedures are applied to the aircraft departure forecasting problem and are compared with methods currently used by the air traffic management system. Numerical examples demonstrate that the procedures increase forecast accuracy while reducing the costs associated with frequent forecast updates.

## 5. Adaptive Memory Tabu Search for Binary Quadratic Programs

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying adaptive memory tabu search procedures to combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper we describe the development and use of such an approach to solve binary quadratic programs. Computational experience is reported, showing that the approach optimally solves the most difficult problems reported in the literature. For challenging problems of limited size, which are capable of being approached by exact procedures, we find optimal solutions considerably faster than the best reported exact method. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more efficient and yields better solutions than the best heuristic method reported to date. Finally, we give outcomes for larger problems that are considerably more challenging than any currently reported in the literature.

## 6. Improved Moment-Estimation Formulas Using More Than Three Subjective Fractiles
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
PERT-type subjective estimations are used in many stochastic decision models to estimate the random variables' mean and standard deviation (s.d.). The approach is based on the beta-distribution assumption; also, most PERT-type formulas use only three estimated fractiles. We point out that: (i) it is desirable to consider a substantially richer set of distributions than the beta in developing PERT-type formulas; (ii) it may be beneficial to use more than three fractile-estimates in PERT-type formulas. We then develop formulas for estimating the mean and s.d. that are based on a substantially richer set of distributions than the beta and that use more than three estimated fractiles. These formulas perform better than the best currently-available formulas when the subjective distribution is not restricted to be beta.

## 7. Assessing the Importance of Design Through Product Archaeology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
This paper assesses the importance of design in determining product costs by measuring the variation in design performance among a set of competing design efforts. This assessment is completed for a set of functionally similar products in a single product category: automatic drip coffee makers. The approach of this study is to measure the manufacturing contentthe attributes of the design that drive costthrough analysis of the physical products themselves, and to estimate how variation in manufacturing content relates to variation in cost in a hypothetical manufacturing setting. We call this approach product archaeology. For the domain of coffee makers, we find significant variation in manufacturing content. This variation in manufacturing content corresponds to a range of estimated manufacturing costs, for a hypothetical manufacturing system, of approximately 50 percent of the average manufacturing cost of the products. We also find that differences in capabilities among product development efforts are the most plausible explanation for the differences in manufacturing content.

## 8. Network Competition and the Timing of Commercials
### Author(s):
- Gil S. Epstein
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
In a market with a small number of networks, the timing of the commercial breaks is a very important factor in determining the number of viewers facing a channel. Using a theoretical model and statistical analysis with empirical data from the four networks in the United States, we analyze the equilibrium achieved in this network monopolistic competition. Among other things, it is shown theoretically and empirically that in equilibrium all networks broadcast commercial breaks at the same time. As the ability to coordinate is not always possible, it is shown that, as the program progresses, the level of coordination decreases.

## 9. Exact Solution of the Two-Dimensional Finite Bin Packing Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
Given a set of rectangular pieces to be cut from an unlimited number of standardized stock pieces (bins), the Two-Dimensional Finite Bin Packing Problem is to determine the minimum number of stock pieces that provide all the pieces. The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and finds many practical applications in the cutting and packing area. We analyze a well-known lower bound and determine its worst-case performance. We propose new lower bounds which are used within a branch-and-bound algorithm for the exact solution of the problem. Extensive computational testing on problem instances from the literature involving up to 120 pieces shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

## 10. The Impact of Discharge Decisions on Health Care Quality
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1998
### Abstract:
In this paper, we present a normative study that describes the impact of discharging decisions in the face of resource shortages. We develop a model that represents the dynamics of a health care unit. Then, to capture the essence of discharge decisions, we consider discharge policies that incorporate both the occupancy level of the unit and the status of patients measured by their stage of recovery and the time they have spent in that stage. We believe that our model can be used as an aid to physicians and administrators to better assess discharge and/or capacity decisions. In addition, we investigate the impact of discharge decisions on the measures that represent the quality of care at a facility such as average hospital stays, system accessibility, and average complication risk of discharged patients. Our findings illustrate that inclusion of early discharge option improves system accessibility significantly and does not jeopardize care equity among patients. Furthermore, introduction of early discharge option has more pronounced effects on increasing care unit capacity than addition of open beds with no early discharges.

## 11. Using Feature Construction to Improve the Performance of Neural Networks

### Abstract:
Recent years have seen the growth in popularity of neural networks for business decision support because of their capabilities for modeling, estimating, and classifying. Compared to other AI methods for problem solving such as expert systems, neural network approaches are especially useful for their ability to learn adaptively from observations. However, neural network learning performed by algorithms such as back-propagation (BP) are known to be slow due to the size of the search space involved and also the iterative manner in which the algorithm works. In this paper, we show that the degree of difficulty in neural network learning is inherent in the given set of training examples. We propose a technique for measuring such learning difficulty, and then develop a feature construction methodology that helps transform the training data so that both the learning speed and classification accuracy of neural network algorithms are improved. We show the efficacy of the proposed method for financial risk classification, a domain characterized by frequent data noise, lack of functional structure, and high attribute interactions. Moreover, the empirical studies also provide insights into the structural characteristics of neural networks with respect to the input data used as well as possible mechanisms to improve the learning performance.
