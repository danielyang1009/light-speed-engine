## 1. Strategic Growth Options

### Published:

### Abstract:
We provide a strategic rationale for growth options under uncertainty and imperfect competition. In a market with strategic competition, investment confers a greater capability to take advantage of future growth opportunities. This strategic advantage leads to the capture of a greater share of the market, either by dissuading entry or by inducing competitors to make room for the stronger competitor. As a result of this strategic effect, payoffs are in a rough sense more convex than in the case of no investment in a growth option. When the strategic advantage is strong, increased uncertainty encourages investment in growth options: higher uncertainty means more opportunity rather than simply larger risk. If the strategic effect is weak, the reverse is true. On the other hand, an increase in systematic risk discourages the acquisition of growth options. Our results contradict the view that volatility is a strong disincentive for investment.

## 2. Communication and Uncertainty in Concurrent Engineering
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
We present an analytical model of concurrent engineering, where an upstream and a down-stream task are overlapped to minimize time-to-market. The gain from overlapping activities must be weighed against the delay from rework that results from proceeding in parallel based on preliminary information. Communication reduces the negative effect of rework at the expense of communication time. We derive the optimal levels of concurrency combined with communication, and we analyze how these two decisions interact in the presence of uncertainty and dependence. Uncertainty is modeled via the average rate of engineering changes, and its reduction via the change of the modification rate over time. In addition, we model dependence by the impact the modifications impose on the downstream task. The model yields three main results. First, we present a dynamic decision rule for determining the optimal meeting schedule. The optimal meeting frequency follows the frequency of engineering changes over time, and it increases with the levels of uncertainty and dependence. Second, we derive the optimal concurrency between activities when communication follows the optimal pattern described by our decision rule. Uncertainty and dependence make concurrency less attractive, reducing the optimal overlap. However, the speed of uncertainty reduction may increase or decrease optimal overlap. Third, choosing communication and concurrency separately prevents achieving the optimal time-to-market, resulting in a need for coordination.

## 3. Knowledge Acquisition from Multiple Experts: An Empirical Study
### Author(s):
- Daniel E. O'Leary
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
Expert systems often employ a weight on rules to capture conditional probabilities. For example, in classic rule-based settings, Pr(h  e) = x is used to mean If e is known to be true then conclude h is true with probability x. Further, other probability-based approaches, such as influence diagrams and Bayes' Nets are increasingly being used to support decision making through decision support systems. Although algorithms for these systems have received substantial attention, less attention has been given to knowledge acquisition of probabilities used in these systems. However, the underlying probabilities are critical because they lead the user to particular solutions. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the quality of probability knowledge when it is acquired from groups or individuals.

## 4. Evaluating Environmental Investments: A Real Options Approach
### Author(s):
- Gonzalo Cortazar
- Eduardo S. Schwartz
- Marcelo Salinas
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
The paper presents a model that determines when (at which output price level) it is optimum for a firm to invest in environmental technologies and which are the main parameters that affect this decision. Our analysis shows that firms require high output price levels to be induced to invest in environmental technologies, because they optimally would not want to commit to a heavy irreversible investment that could turn out to be unprofitable in the event of a price fall. A comparative static analysis predicts that firms in industries with high output price volatility would be more reluctant to invest in environmental protection technologies and would be more willing to operate at low output levels (thus attaining low emission levels). Increases in the interest rate would also reduce optimal environmental investment levels.

## 5. Investment Strategies for Flexible Resources
### Author(s):
- Jan A. Van Mieghem
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
This article studies optimal investment in flexible manufacturing capacity as a function of product prices (margins), investment costs and multivariate demand uncertainty. We consider a two-product firm that has the option to invest in product-dedicated resources and/or in a flexible resource that can produce either product, but has to make its investment decision before demands are observed. The flexible resource provides the firm with a hedge against demand uncertainty, but at a higher investment cost than the dedicated resources. Our analysis highlights the important role of price (margin) and cost mix differentials, which, in addition to the correlation between product demands, significantly affect the investment decision and the value of flexibility. Contrary to the intuition also prevalent in the academic literature, we show that it can be advantageous to invest in flexible resources even with perfectly positively correlated product demands.

## 6. When Does Forced Idle Time Improve Performance in Polling Models?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
Sarkar and Zangwill (1991) showed by numerical examples that reduction in setup times can, surprisingly, actually increase work in process in some cyclic production systems (that is, reduction in switchover times can increase waiting times in some polling models). We present, for polling models with exhaustive and gated service disciplines, some explicit formulas that provide additional insight and characterization of this anomaly. More specifically, we show that, for both of these models, there exist simple formulas that define for each queue a critical value z* of the mean total setup time z per cycle such that, if zz*, then the expected waiting time at that queue will be minimized if the server is forced to idle for a constant length of time z*  z every cycle; also, for the symmetric polling model, we give a simple explicit formula for the expected waiting time and the critical value z* that minimizes it.

## 7. Validation in Simulation: Various Positions in the Philosophy of Science
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
There is still considerable doubt and even anxiety among simulation modelers as to what the methodologically correct guidelines or procedures for validating simulation models should be. Epistemically, the approaches one finds in the simulation literature run the gamut from objectivist to relativist with shades in between. At present in the philosophy of science, there appears to be a convergence toward a nonalgorithmic but discursive and nonrelativistic view of the argumentation involved in warranting scientific theorizing. The present paper attempts to give a description of the various philosophical positions as well as to summarize their problems and the kinds of evidentiary arguments they would each allow in arriving at defensible simulation models. From the debate, we attempt to set out a perspective that frees the practioner to pursue a varied set of approaches to validation with a diminished burden of methodological anxiety. Reciprocally this perspective does not let the modeler off of the hook but rather converts the validation problem into an ethical problem in which the practitioner must responsibly and professionally argue for the warrant of the model.

## 8. An Optimization Based Heuristic for Political Districting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
Redistricting, the redrawing of congressional district boundaries within the states, may occur every 10 years on the basis of the population census. Many redistricting plans are designed with partisan politics in mind, resulting in disputes and forcing judges to intervene. We address this problem from a nonpolitical viewpoint and present an optimization based heuristic incorporating universally agreed upon characteristics. We model the problem as a constrained graph partitioning problem and develop a specialized branch-and-price based solution methodology. We demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology by showing how to satisfy the one-person, one-vote principle with compact and contiguous districts for the state of South Carolina.

## 9. Technological ForecastingModel Selection, Model Stability, and Combining Models
### Author(s):
- Nigel Meade
- Towhidul Islam
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
The paper identifies 29 models that the literature suggests are appropriate for technological forecasting. These models are divided into three classes according to the timing of the point of inflexion in the innovation or substitution process. Faced with a given data set and such a choice, the issue of model selection needs to be addressed. Evidence used to aid model selection is drawn from measures of model fit and model stability. An analysis of the forecasting performance of these models using simulated data sets shows that it is easier to identify a class of possible models rather than the best model. This leads to the combining of model forecasts. The performance of the combined forecasts appears promising with a tendency to outperform the individual component models.

## 10. Computationally Manageable Combinational Auctions
### Author(s):
- Michael H. Rothkopf

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
There is interest in designing simultaneous auctions for situations such as the recent FCC radio spectrum auctions, in which the value of assets to a bidder depends on which other assets he or she wins. In such auctions, bidders may wish to submit bids for combinations of assets. When this is allowed, the problem of determining the revenue maximizing set of nonconflicting bids can be difficult. We analyze this problem, identifying several different structures of permitted combinational bids for which computational tractability is constructively demonstrated and some structures for which computational tractability cannot be guaranteed.

## 11. How Decision Makers Evaluate Alternatives and the Influence of Complexity
### Author(s):
- Paul C. Nutt
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1998
### Abstract:
The evaluation of alternatives during organizational decision making was investigated to uncover evaluation tactics used by decision makers and how these tactics and complexity influenced success. Evaluation tactics that relied upon subjective, judgmental, bargaining, and analytical inferences were uncovered from 317 strategic decisions. The complexity of these decisions was measured by the numbers of alternatives considered, number of criteria used, and perceived difficulty of the evaluation task to identify conditions under which the evaluation tactics were successful. The managerial implications of evaluating alternatives with the tactics that used judgmental, bargaining, analytical, and subjective inferences under different levels of complexity are discussed.
