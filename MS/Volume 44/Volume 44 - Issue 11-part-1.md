## 1. Process Innovation and Learning by Doing in Semiconductor Manufacturing

### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the relationship between process innovation and learning by doing in the semiconductor industry where improvements in manufacturing yield are a catalyst for dynamic cost reductions. In contrast to most previous studies of learning by doing, the learning curve is shown here to be the product of deliberate activities intended to improve yields and reduce costs, rather than the incidental byproduct of production volume. Since some of the knowledge acquired through learning by doing during new process development is specific to the production environment where the process is developed, some knowledge is effectively lost when a new process is transferred to manufacturing. We find that dedicated process development facilities, geographic proximity between development and manufacturing facilities, and the duplication of equipment between development and manufacturing facilities are all significant in improving performance in introducing new technologies. Once in manufacturing, new processes are shown to disrupt the ongoing learning activities of existing processes by drawing away scarce engineering resources to debug the new processes.

### Abstract:
We consider the long-run odds that narcotics users remain abstinent after methadone treatment. A flexible split-hazard specification that allows for individual-level differences in both the long-run probability of eventual relapse and the short-run timing of relapse is developed. The model is applied to a comprehensive data set involving individual drug abuse and treatment histories for over 800 addicts. Our findings indicate (1) that the short-run success of methadone programs does not automatically translate into long-run abstinence, which suggests the need for aftercare, (2) the value of preventing a teenager or young adult from initiating, and (3) the possibility of identifying high-risk groups, both in terms of age of first daily use and in terms of ethnicity.

## 3. Cross-Disciplinary Evidence for Hyperbolic Social Discount Rates
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
Researchers in different disciplines have independently found evidence to suggest that the social discount rate may be hyperbolic, rather than exponential, in nature. Both behaviorist research and some empirical economics studies support the hyperbolic discounting hypothesis. U.S. and U.K. government discounting dispensations for some long-run public development projects are explicable in terms of an underlying hyperbolic social discount rate. A statistical aggregation argument demonstrates that even if the behaviorist, economics and public choice evidence for hyperbolic discounting is not conclusive, the social discount rate of a set of people who individually express time preferences best modeled by exponential discounting functions is nonetheless hyperbolic.

## 4. The Effects of Cross-Ruff Coupons on Sales and Profits
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
Cross-ruff coupons are obtained at the time of purchase of a carrier brand and may be redeemed at a later date on a target brand. These coupons therefore have the ability to link consumer purchases across different brands as well as shopping trips. We model the effects of cross-ruff coupons on consumer choice behavior and derive the conditions under which cross-ruff coupons can lead to higher sales and profits than other types of package coupons. The model also provides insights into the selection of appropriate carrier and target brands, and on how the choice of an appropriate carrier or a target brand is affected when the categories that these brands belong to are demand complements or substitutes. We conduct an empirical analysis using data from 195 different cross-ruff coupon campaigns observed in grocery stores in a major U.S. city over a three-month period. The data are consistent with the key insights provided by the model.

## 5. Process Improvement, Quality, and Learning Effects
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
While quality has attracted significant attention in the past two decades, the debate is still on as to whether a firm should aim for zero defects or base its quality decisions on cost-benefit trade-offs. The continuous improvement advocates generally eschew the cost trade-off approach, but U.S. firms, after spending substantial sums on quality-related activities in the 1980s, appear to be focusing again on cost trade-offs and measures such as return on quality. This paper provides analytical support for the continuous improvement argument while relying on a cost trade-off analysis. We present a dynamic model of a monopolist making decisions on price, production, process improvement, and quality assurance efforts. The model is comprehensive and captures the effects of autonomous and induced learning on both productivity and quality and incorporates quality related costs in detail. Using this model, we show that quality improves over time, while process improvement effort and quality assurance effort decrease over time. In fact, as anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests, process improvement and quality assurance effort is high when quality level is low, and vice-versa. The optimal production rate is increasing and the optimal price is decreasing over time. We also provide valuable insights into the impact of changes in key parameters such as interest rates on production, price, process improvement effort, and quality assurance effort.

## 6. Logit Demand Estimation Under Competitive Pricing Behavior: An Equilibrium Framework
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
Discrete choice models of demand have typically been estimated assuming that prices are exogenous. Since unobservable (to the researcher) product attributes, such as coupon availability, may impact consumer utility as well as price setting by firms, we treat prices as endogenous. Specifically, prices are assumed to be the equilibrium outcomes of Nash competition among manufacturers and retailers. To empirically validate the assumptions, we estimate logit demand systems jointly with equilibrium pricing equations for two product categories using retail scanner data and cost data on factor prices. In each category, we find statistical evidence of price endogeneity. We also find that the estimates of the price response parameter and the brand-specific constants are generally biased downward when the endogeneity of prices is ignored. Our framework provides explicit estimates of the value created by a brand, i.e., the difference between consumers' willingness to pay for a brand and its cost of production. We develop theoretical propositions about the relationship between value creation and competitive advantage for logit demand systems and use our empirical results to illustrate how firms use alternative value creation strategies to accomplish competitive advantage.

## 7. ACLIPS: A Capacity and Lead Time Integrated Procedure for Scheduling
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
We propose a general hierarchical procedure to address real-life job shop scheduling problems. The shop typically produces a variety of products, each with its own arrival stream, its own route through the shop and a given customer due date. The procedure first determines the manufacturing lot sizes for each product. The objective is to minimize the expected lead time, and therefore we model the production environment as a queueing network. Given these lead times, release dates are set dynamically. This in turn creates a time window for every manufacturing order in which the various operations have to be sequenced. The sequencing logic is based on an Extended Shifting Bottleneck Procedure. These three major decisions are next incorporated into a four-phase, hierarchical, operational implementation scheme. A small numerical example is used to illustrate the methodology. The final objective however is to develop a procedure that is useful for large, real-life shops. We therefore report on a real-life application.

## 8. Probabilistic Analyses and Algorithms for Three-Level Distribution Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of integrating inventory control and vehicle routing into a cost-effective strategy for a distribution system consisting of a single outside vendor, a fixed number of warehouses and many geographically dispersed retailers. Each retailer faces a constant, retailer specific, demand rate and inventory holding cost is charged at the retailers and the warehouses. We show that, in an effective strategy which minimizes the asymptotic long run average cost, each warehouse receives fully loaded trucks from the vendor but never holds inventory. That is, each warehouse serves only as a coordinator of the frequency, time and sizes of deliveries to the retailers. This insight is used to construct an inventory control policy and vehicle routing strategy for multi-echelon distribution systems. Computational results are also reported.

## 9. An Analysis of Bid-Price Controls for Network Revenue Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1998
### Abstract:
Bid-prices are becoming an increasingly popular method for controlling the sale of inventory in revenue management applications. In this form of control, thresholdor bidprices are set for the resources or units of inventory (seats on flight legs, hotel rooms on specific dates, etc.) and a product (a seat in a fare class on an itinerary or room for a sequence of dates) is sold only if the offered fare exceeds the sum of the threshold prices of all the resources needed to supply the product. This approach is appealing on intuitive and practical grounds, but the theory underlying it is not well developed. Moreover, the extent to which bid-price controls represent optimal or near optimal policies is not well understood. Using a general model of the demand process, we show that bid-price control is not optimal in general and analyze why bid-price schemes can fail to produce correct accept/deny decisions. However, we prove that when leg capacities and sales volumes are large, bid-price controls are asymptotically optimal, provided the right bid prices are used. We also provide analytical upper bounds on the optimal revenue. In addition, we analyze properties of the asymptotically optimal bid prices. For example, we show they are constant over time, even when demand is nonstationary, and that they may not be unique.
