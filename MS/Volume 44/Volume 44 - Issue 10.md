## 1. Information Technology and Organization Design: Locating Decisions and Information
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We study the impact of information technology (IT) on the profitability of individual organization designs and on the relative profitability of different organization designs. We develop models where organization design is defined by the location of investment decision authority. We consider global and local investment when there is an information asymmetry between a central authority and decentralized nodesdecentralized nodes make better local investment decisions because of their local knowledge. We define three separate organization designs: a hierarchy where all investments are made by a central authority, a market where all investments are made by the decentralized nodes, and a mixed mode where global investments are made by a central authority and local investments are made by decentralized nodes. Because of complementarities between global and local investment, we show that there is under investment relative to first-best in all three organization designs. We also find that IT can be used to mitigate that underinvestment, either by bringing information to the decision maker or by redesigning the monitoring and incentive structure. We demonstrate that IT does not necessarily favor decentralized organization designs, and we show how the costs of coordination may result in the mixed mode being dominated by one or both of the alternative organization designs. Thus, collocation of investment decision rights and information that results in decisions that require coordination might not be optimal when the costs of not synchronizing global and local investment are high.

### Abstract:
Air Force 2025 was a study directed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force to identify key system concepts and technologies for achieving air and space dominance in the year 2025. The study was a large effort in which over 200 military experts participated for more than one year. We developed a Value-Focused Thinking model, which we used to evaluate which futuristic system concepts have the greatest potential to ensure future U.S. air and space dominance. We named the value model Foundations 2025 because it represented a return to the basics of air and space dominance. We used the silver standard approach for value hierarchy development. The participants identified key verbs to describe tasks that must be performed in 2025 to ensure air and space dominance. The value hierarchy was developed bottom-up by aggregating these verbs into higher order tasks using affinity diagrams. Using the value hierarchy, we used multiattribute decision analysis techniques to develop an additive value model with 134 attributes. The Foundations 2025 value model was successfully used to score 43 futuristic system concepts and provide insights about the most promising system concepts and technologies. The analysis results directly supported the study director and the senior leadership of the United States Air Force.

## 3. Tree Diversity, Landscape Diversity, and Economics of Maple-Birch Forests: Implications of Markovian Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
Markov decision process (MDP) models were effective in analyzing forest management policies. Even the simplest standard results gave useful insights into forest ecology, such as how landscape diversity is shaped by natural catastrophes, and how forests mature through successional phases. The methods were also useful to predict the effects of different management policies on ecological and economic criteria. Optimization augmented the usefulness of the approach, suggesting that income from Wisconsin's maple-birch forests could be increased without ruining their diversity of landscape, tree size, and tree species. It showed that maximizing species diversity, defined by the distribution of trees in shade-tolerance classes, would require some harvest. Instead, maximum tree size diversity occurred in unmanaged forests, but this gave a less diverse landscape and no income. The MDP method allowed for the design of compromise policies that would maximize income while keeping diversity above specified limits. The opportunity cost of increasing tree size diversity was found to be much higher than for species diversity. Comparing the maximum timber income owners could have got with what they actually cut suggested that the amenity value of forests was four times that of timber. Advantages of the methods reside in the ability to model complex ecosystem processes with simple probability matrices, and in the rich MDP theory and algorithms. Limitations include the difficulty of defining a space set large enough for accurate discretization, but small enough for practical application.

## 4. Repetitive Testing Strategies When the Testing Process Is Imperfect
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of test design and implementation when testing is imperfect. Items that are classified as conforming may be nonconforming, resulting in a poor outgoing quality level. Items that are classified as nonconforming may be conforming, resulting in excessive scrapping of conforming items. The failed items are commonly retested to reduce the scrapping problem. Alternatively, the accepted items may be retested to improve outgoing quality. In this paper, we examine the question of whether it is better to repetitively test rejected items, or to repetitively test accepted items. We also examine the relationship between the two testing policies, testing equipment accuracy and capacity, incoming quality, and outgoing quality requirements.

## 5. A Probabilistic Decision Model for Entity Matching in Heterogeneous Databases
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
In recent years, there has been a proliferation of database systems in all types of organizations. In many cases, these databases are developed in different departments and maintained autonomously. Much is to be gained, however, if databases across departments, divisions, or even organizations can be related to one another. One main problem of relating data stored in different databases is the differences in their representation of real-world entities, such as the use of different identifiers or primary keys. We present a decision theoretic model for matching entities across different databases. The decision to match two entities from two different databases inherently involves some uncertainty since an exact match may not be found because of errors in data collection, data entry, and data representation. We model this uncertainty using probability theory and propose an integer programming formulation that minimizes the total cost associated with the entity matching decision. The model has been implemented and validated on real-world data.

## 6. Multinomial Logit Market Share Models: Equilibrium Characteristics and Strategic Implications
### Author(s):
- Suman Basuroy
- Dung Nguyen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
We specify and analyze the conditions under which the MNL market share models are appropriate for equilibrium analysis. Our results show that a linear price response function as is often used in empirical research, in conjunction with the typical concavity assumed in a large range of marketing response functions, would yield an interior equilibrium solution. We then consider the optimal reactions on pricing and marketing spending to entry and potential market expansion. In the context of the MNL models, we demonstrate that the entry of a new brand evokes a decrease in the equilibrium prices of the existing brands as a defensive reaction. This is true in both an expanding market as well as a fixed market. However, while new entry into a fixed market would trigger the incumbents to lower the marketing expenditure, we show that firms tend to raise marketing activities as they experience market expansion. Consequently, there exist distinct possibilities that marketing efforts for the existing brands increase in view of entry in an expanding market. Further managerial and marketing implications for endogeneity of the number of firms are explored.

## 7. Lot-Sizing with Start-Up Times
### Author(s):
- Franois Vanderbeck
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
Many practical applications of lot-sizing and scheduling problems involve start-up times. Operations research literature contains but few studies of lot-sizing models that take start-up times explicitly into account. Here, we review some of these studies, discuss the models and their complexity, and we propose further models. We consider in particular a single-stage single-mode multi-item lot-sizing model with continuous set-ups and sequence independent start-up times, which we solve using an integer programming column generation algorithm and we develop a dynamic programming procedure for the single-item subproblem that treats the initial stock as a decision variable. We also use cutting planes developed by Constantino for the multi-item polyhedra. By combining column and cut generation, the lower bounds that we obtain before branching are on average less than 2% from an optimal solution. Our algorithm solves instances with 3 to 5 items and 24 periods in an average of 50 seconds on a modern workstation, and problems with 36 periods in an average of 750 seconds. Solutions guaranteed to be within 2% of optimality are obtained in less than 75% of these times.

## 8. Likelihood Ratio Derivative Estimation for Finite-Time Performance Measures in Generalized Semi-Markov Processes
### Author(s):
- Marvin K. Nakayama

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the likelihood ratio method for estimating derivatives of finite-time performance measures in generalized semi-Markov processes (GSMPs). We develop readily verifiable conditions for the applicability of this method. Our conditions mainly place restrictions on the basic building blocks (i.e., the transition probabilities, the distribution and density functions of the event lifetimes, and the initial distribution) of the GSMP, which is in contrast to the structural conditions needed for infinitesimal perturbation analysis. We explicitly show that our conditions hold in many practical settings, and in particular, for large classes of queueing and reliability models. One intermediate result we obtain in this study, which is of independent value, is to formally show that the random variable representing the number of occurring events in a GSMP in a finite time horizon, has finite exponential moments in a neighborhood of zero.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1998
### Abstract:
For the multi-machine job shop scheduling problem, a conceptually simple simulation-based procedure (first proposed by Lawrence and Morton 1986) is shown to be both effective and efficient in providing optimal, or near optimal, schedules for minimizing the maximum lateness, Lmax. Computational experimentation is used to identify the conditions under which the approach is most viable.
