### Abstract:
This paper concerns the modeling of low inventory lines. Currently, most models assume that processing times are independent. We consider the differences in behavior of workers in low- and high-inventory production lines. Using a laboratory experiment we show that workers speed up when they are the cause of idle time on the line. This means that processing time distributions are not independent of the size of the buffer, of the processing speed of co-workers, or of the amount of inventory in the system. We show that the direction of these effects is predictable and that the magnitude is significant. In particular, there is less idle time and higher output than would be predicted using assumptions of independence. In this experiment the effect completely canceled productivity loss due to blocking and starving. This work is important in understanding both the motivation of workers in low-inventory systems and the implications of models of manufacturing flow lines.

## 2. A Bilevel Model of Taxation and Its Application to Optimal Highway Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
We consider a bilevel model where the leader wants to maximize revenues from a taxation scheme, while the follower rationally reacts to those tax levels. We focus our attention on the special case of a toll-setting problem defined on a multicommodity transportation network. We show that the general problem is NP-complete, while particular instances are polynomially solvable. Numerical examples are given.

## 3. Incentive-Compatible Pricing for a Service Facility with Joint Production and Congestion Externalities
### Author(s):
- Albert Y. Ha
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper considers the pricing problem of a service facility when services are jointly produced by the customers and the facility. Building on the work of Mendelson (1985), we model the facility as a GI/GI/1 queue with customer-chosen service rates and linear delay costs. We show that the service rates chosen by the customers, based on their self-interest, are always suboptimal for the facility due to congestion externalities. We derive optimal incentive-compatible pricing schemes that can achieve optimal arrival rates and induce customers to choose optimal service rates. For the case of systemwide net-value maximization, we show that the optimal incentive-compatible pricing scheme consists of a variable fee that is proportional to the actual service time and a fixed rebate that is equal to a customer's expected delay cost in the queue. For the case of profit maximization of the facility, we show that the optimal pricing scheme again consists of a fixed fee and a variable fee. One insight from our analysis is that it may be appropriate for a service facility to reimburse each customer for his actual delay cost in the queue.

## 4. Vehicle Scheduling in Public Transit and Lagrangean Pricing
### Author(s):
- Andreas Lbel
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the multi-commodity flow formulation of the multiple-depot vehicle scheduling problems arising in public mass transit. We develop a column generation technique that makes it possible to solve the huge linear programs that come up there. The technique, which we call Lagrangean pricing, is based on two different Lagrangean relaxations.

## 5. Financial Data and the Skewed Generalized T Distribution
### Author(s):
- Panayiotis Theodossiou
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
This paper develops a skewed extension of the generalized t (GT) distribution, introduced by McDonald and Newey (1988). In particular, the paper derives the mathematical moments and other properties of the distribution and assesses its ability to fit the empirical distribution of several financial series characterized by skewness and excess kurtosis. In all cases the skewed GT provides an excellent fit to the empirical distribution of data.

## 6. Incentive Effects Favor Nonconsolidating Queues in a Service System: The PrincipalAgent Perspective
### Author(s):
- Stephen M. Gilbert
- Z. Kevin Weng
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study a service network in which an agency is responsible for satisfying a constraint on the expected waiting and service time experienced by customers. However, the agency does not render the actual service. Instead, it serves to coordinate independently operated facilities. The coordinating agency must devise a strategy for allocating compensation and customers to the self-interested operators in order to minimize its own costs. For a network of two facilities, we model the facilities' self-interested capacity decisions as the solution to a game. Using this analytical framework, we compare two types of customer allocation: one from a common queue, and one from separate queues. Our analysis shows that it can be in the best interest of the coordinating agency to adopt a separate queue allocation scheme instead of one based on a common queue. Although doing so sacrifices risk-pooling benefits, these can be more than offset by the stronger incentives that are created for the independent facilities.

## 7. Research, Development, and Engineering Metrics
### Author(s):
- John R. Hauser
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
We seek to understand how the use of Research, Development, and Engineering (R,D&E) metrics can lead to more effective management of R,D&E. This paper combines qualitative and quantitative research to understand and improve the use of R,D&E metrics. Our research begins with interviews of 43 representative Chief Technical Officers, Chief Executive Offices, and researchers at 10 research-intensive international organizations. These interviews, and an extensive review of the literature, provide qualitative insights. Formal mathematical models attempt to explore these qualitative insights based on more general principles.

## 8. Evaluating Income Streams: A Decision Analysis Approach
### Author(s):
- James E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
Most important decision problemsvirtually all capital investments and planning situationsinvolve risky cash flows with uncertainties that are resolved over time. In most of these problems, the decision-maker has access to financial markets and may borrow and lend to smooth consumption over time. Yet, because of the difficulty of incorporating these borrowing and lending decisions into the evaluation models, these opportunities are rarely explicitly modeled in decision and risk analyses of these investments. In this paper, we study the errors induced by failing to account for these borrowing and lending decisions, and we develop extensions to the standard decision and risk analysis procedures that, given certain market and preference assumptions, take these borrowing and lending opportunities into account without overburdening the evaluation models.

## 9. Limit Theory for Performance Modeling of Future Event Set Algorithms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1998
### Abstract:
In a discrete-event simulation, the information related to the events scheduled to occur in the future is kept in a data structure called the future event set (FES). In this paper, we study the interaction hold model, a popular stochastic model for FES performance analysis, corresponding to the superposition of a (fixed) number of renewal processes. The general state-space Markov chain formed by the discrete-time process that keeps track, at event times, of the residual lifetimes is shown here to be recurrent in the sense of Harris, and its stationary distribution is obtained. Linked lists and indexed lists, two popular FESs, are investigated using this model. For the interaction hold model, we make rigorous certain published results as well as introduce new ones. For example, we derive the distribution of the relative position of the event to be inserted in the data structure. In the exponential case, our analytic and empirical results confirm that when events with relatively short lifetimes often get regenerated upon their occurrence, it is better to scan a list (or sublist) from its head rather than tail. In the same context and for indexed lists with sublists with constant sizes, our results suggest that subsequent sublists should be of larger sizes, i.e., the first sublist should contain the smallest number of records, the second sublist the second smallest number of records, etc.
