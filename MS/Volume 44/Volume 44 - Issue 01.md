## 1. R&D and Global Manufacturing Performance
### Author(s):
- John E. Ettlie
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
R&D intensity and manufacturing performance were evaluated in this study of 600 durable goods firms in 20 countries. In a path-analytic model, R&D intensity was significantly associated with improvements in market share (R2 = 34%), controlling for firm size, previous market share, and regardless of industry or region of the world. Market share increases were also significantly correlated with improvements in manufacturing agility (R2 = 4%). Agility improvement was significantly correlated with R&D intensity, and computerization in manufacturing, controlling for firm size and region, and did exhibit industry effects, with electronic equipment firms elevated on this measure. Computerization exhibited regional (not industry) differences, with South American firms depressed on this measure. The role of computerization in manufacturing and agility in firm innovativeness are discussed.

## 2. Capacity Expansion and Replacement in Growing Markets with Uncertain Technological Breakthroughs

### Abstract:
The accelerated pace of technological change has led to rapid obsolescence of productive capacity in electronics and other industries. Managers must consider the impact of future technologies while making acquisition and replacement decisions in such environments. We consider a problem where a sequence of technological breakthroughs are anticipated but their magnitude and timing are uncertain. A firm, operating in such an environment, must decide how much capacity of the current technology to acquire to meet future demand growth. It must also determine whether to upgrade any of the older vintages. We formulate this problem and present some structural results. Using these results, we then develop a highly efficient regeneration point-based dynamic programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through a computational study. The sensitivity of the first period decision to various parameters is also explored.

## 3. Financial Asset-Pricing Theory and Stochastic Programming Models for Asset/Liability Management: A Synthesis
### Author(s):
- Pieter Klaassen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
Practical portfolio investment problems under uncertainty can be modeled well as multiperiod stochastic programs. However, the numerical optimization methods that need to be used to solve such models seriously limit the level of detail in the uncertainty about future asset prices and returns that can be incorporated. Somewhat surprisingly, the question how this necessarily approximate description of the uncertainty should be constructed has received relatively little attention in the stochastic programming literature. Moreover, many of the descriptions that have been used are not arbitrage-free, and therefore inconsistent with modern financial asset-pricing theory. In this paper we will present aggregation methods that can be used in combination with financial asset-pricing models to obtain a description of the uncertainty that is arbitrage-free, consistent with observed market prices as well as concise enough for a stochastic programming model. Furthermore, we will discuss how these aggregation methods can form the basis of an iterative solution approach.

## 4. Sensitivity Analysis of Efficiency Scores: How to Bootstrap in Nonparametric Frontier Models
### Author(s):
- Lopold Simar
- Paul W. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
Efficiency scores of production units are generally measured relative to an estimated production frontier. Nonparametric estimators (DEA, FDH, ) are based on a finite sample of observed production units. The bootstrap is one easy way to analyze the sensitivity of efficiency scores relative to the sampling variations of the estimated frontier. The main point in order to validate the bootstrap is to define a reasonable data-generating process in this complex framework and to propose a reasonable estimator of it. This paper provides a general methodology of bootstrapping in nonparametric frontier models. Some adapted methods are illustrated in analyzing the bootstrap sampling variations of input efficiency measures of electricity plants.

## 5. Deterrence, Reputations, and Competitive Cognition
### Author(s):
- Bruce H. Clark
- David B. Montgomery
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
This study examines an aspect of competitive interactions that has attracted increasing research attention: the relationship between deterrence and competitive reputations. We build a conceptual model of the antecedents and consequences of a firm's reputation for being a credible defender of its markets. Theory and limited empirical evidence suggests a firm with this reputation should deter competitive attacks against it. We explore how a manager's competitive cognition about her opponents' (1) patterns of activity in the marketplace and (2) previous success can lead her to perceive a competitor as a credible defender. We test the framework using MBA students in a quasi-field setting, the Markstrat2 simulation game. The results of this study suggest that reputation deters attack only when the potential attacker considers the target firm a minor competitor. Managers consider defenders that have previously been successful as credible defenders of their markets. They also weigh consistency of activity relative to industry average in making inferences about credibility. The study indicates that the deterrence-reputation link is more complex than previous theory and evidence might imply, and suggests considerable promise for a psychological approach to examining competitive interactions.

## 6. SPOT: Scheduling Programs Optimally for Television
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
This paper introduces SPOT (Scheduling Programs Optimally for Television), an analytical model for optimal prime-time TV program scheduling. Due in part to the advent of new cable TV channels, the competition for viewer ratings has intensified substantially in recent years, and the revenues of the major networks have not kept pace with the costs of the programs. As profit margins decrease, the networks seek to improve their viewer ratings with innovative scheduling strategies. Our SPOT models for scheduling network programs combine predicted ratings for different combinations of prime-time schedules with a novel, mixed-integer, generalized network-based flow, mathematical programming model, which when solved provides an optimal schedule. In addition to historical performance, subjective inputs from actual network managers were used as input to the network flow optimization model. The optimization model is flexible. It can utilize the managers' input and maximize profit (instead of ratings) by considering not only the revenue potential but also the costs of the shows. Moreover, SPOT can describe the scheduling problem over any time period (e.g., day, week, month, season), and designate certain shows to, and restrict them from, given time slots. The methodology of SPOT is illustrated using data for the first quarter of 1990, obtained from a cable network. The optimization model produces solutions that would have generated an increase of approximately 2% in overall profitability, representing over $6 million annually for the cable network. SPOT not only produces more profitable TV schedules for this network, but also provides valuable general insights into the development of mixed programming strategies for improving future schedules.

## 7. Assembly System Design: A Branch and Cut Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the single-product assembly system design problem (ASDP), which seeks to minimize total cost by optimally integrating design (selecting the machine type to locate at each activated station) and operating issues (assigning tasks to observe precedence relationships and cycle time restrictions). We propose an effective branch-and-cut approach for solving single-product ASDPs, adapting inequalities known to be valid for embedded line balancing structures to form inequalities that are valid for the ASDP. The implementation also involves a specialized preprocessor, a heuristic, separation procedures, and an enumeration scheme. Computational tests establish benchmark results for this first implementation of cutting planes for solving the ASDP.

## 8. Equilibrium Play in Large Group Market Entry Games
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
Coordination behavior is studied experimentally in a class of noncooperative market entry games featuring symmetric players, complete information, zero entry costs, and several randomly presented values of the market capacity. Once the market capacity becomes publicly known, each player must decide privately whether to enter the market and receive a payoff, which increases linearly in the difference between the market capacity and the number of entrants, or stay out. Payoffs for staying out are either positive, giving rise to the domain of gains, or negative, giving rise to the domain of losses. The major findings are substantial individual differences that do not diminish with practice, aggregate behavior that is organized extremely well in both the domains of gains and losses by the Nash equilibrium solution, and variations in the population action strategies with repeated play of the stage game that are accounted for by a variant of an adaptive learning model due to Roth and Erev (1995).

## 9. Note. Optimal Storage Assignment Policies for Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems with Stochastic Demands
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1998
### Abstract:
In existing AS/RS research, storage assignment policies are evaluated based on the probability that item type j will be stored (and subsequently retrieved). This note applies the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies of Hausman et al. (1976) to a stochastic environment by identifying the kth pallet of item type j: Frequently demanded pallets are stored close to the input/output point and rarely demanded pallets are stored at the end of the storage rack. We consider a discrete storage rack and a continuous storage rack. For the continuous rack case, we develop an expression for expected one-way travel time given uniform and exponentially distributed demand. We show that the turnover-based policy applied to the stochastic environment is optimal (it minimizes one-way travel time) and that both the turnover-based and class-based assignment policies applied in the stochastic environment reduce expected storage/retrieval time compared with random assignment. These savings can be directly translated into increased throughput capacity for existing systems and can be used to improve the design of proposed systems.
