### Abstract:
Expert panels are playing an increasingly important role in U.S. health policy decision making. A fundamental issue in these applications is how to synthesize the judgments of individual experts into a group judgment. In this paper we propose an approach to synthesis based on Bayesian hierarchical models, and apply it to the problem of determining physician staffing at medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA).

## 2. Variability Reduction Through Operations Reversal
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
Products with high product variety are often made in a manufacturing process (or a supply chain) consisting of multiple stages, with products taking certain features or personalities at each stage. The product may start as a common single engine. As the product moves along manufacturing process, more features are added, and the product assumes more identities of the final end product. When demands of the end products are variable from period to period, the production volumes of the intermediate stages in the manufacturing process are also variable. It is widely recognized that variabilities of production volumes may add cost to the process. This paper is motivated by our observations in industry, where some companies have reengineered the manufacturing process by reversing two consecutive stages of the process. Such changes could lead to variance reduction, thereby improving the performance of the process. We develop formalized models that characterize the impact of such changes: operations reversal. These models are used to derive insights on when such reversal would be advisable.

## 3. Decision Support for Target-Based Resource Allocation of Public Services in Multiunit and Multilevel Systems
### Author(s):
- Antreas D. Athanassopoulos
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the problem of resource allocation and target setting in the provision of public services. The paper develops a network-based representation of multilevel resource management with equity, efficiency, and effectiveness being recognised as the fundamental objectives of the system. On the modelling side, the proposed method combines data envelopment analysis and goal programming formulations integrated within an interactive planning framework. An illustrative application on fire departments is used to show the applicability of the method developed to assist the resource allocation process.

## 4. The Stochastic Modeling of Purchase Intentions and Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
A common objective of social science and business research is the modeling of the relationship between demographic/psychographic characteristics of individuals and the likelihood of certain behaviors for these same individuals. Frequently, data on actual behavior are unavailable; rather, one has available only the self-reported intentions of the individual. If the reported intentions imperfectly predict actual behavior, then any model of behavior based on the intention data should account for the associated measurement error, or else the resulting predictions will be biased. In this paper, we provide a method for analyzing intentions data that explicitly models the discrepancy between reported intention and behavior, thus facilitating a less biased assessment of the impact of designated covariates on actual behavior. The application examined here relates to modeling relationships between demographic characteristics and actual purchase behavior among consumers. A new Bayesian approach employing the Gibbs sampler is developed and compared to alternative models. We show, through simulated and real data, that, relative to methods that implicitly equate intentions and behavior, the proposed method can increase the accuracy with which purchase response models are estimated.

## 5. An Approximate Method for Sampling Correlated Random Variables from Partially-Specified Distributions
### Author(s):
- Philip M. Lurie
- Matthew S. Goldberg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for generating correlated vectors of random numbers. The user need not fully specify the joint distribution function; instead, the user partially specifies only the marginal distributions and the correlation matrix. The algorithm may be applied to any set of continuous, strictly increasing distribution functions; the marginal distributions need not all be of the same functional form. The correlation matrix is first checked for mathematical consistency (positive semi-definiteness), and adjusted if necessary. Then the correlated random vectors are generated using a combination of Cholesky decomposition and Gauss-Newton iteration. Applications are made to cost analysis, where correlations are often present between cost elements in a work breakdown structure.

## 6. New Bounds and Heuristics for (Q, r) Policies
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Gallego
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
To clarify the impact of demand variability on single item stochastic inventory systems with setup costs, we subsume the distributional information of the lead time demand into its mean and variance and solve the resulting problem against the worst possible distribution in this class. For (Q, r) policies we obtain in closed form a distribution-free solution for Q and r, and upper bounds on the optimal long run average cost and on the optimal batch size. As a byproduct we develop a robust, distribution-free, batch size heuristic that causes a relative cost increase of no more than 6.07%. In addition, when the newsvendor cost is known, we obtain sharper lower and upper bounds on the long run average cost. These bounds clarify, in an exceedingly simple way, the cost impact of fixed setup costs, demand variability, and constraints on the batch size. We illustrate our bounds and heuristics on problems with Poisson and Compound Poisson demands.

## 7. Standardized Time Series Lp-Norm Variance Estimators for Simulations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
This paper studies a class of estimators for the variance parameter of a stationary stochastic process. The estimators are based on Lp norms of standardized time series, and they generalize previously studied estimators due to Schruben. We show that the new estimators have some desirable properties: they are asymptotically unbiased and have low asymptotic variance. We also illustrate empirically the performance of the Lp-norm estimators on various stochastic processes.

## 8. Stability and Chaos in Input Pricing for a Service Facility with Adaptive Customer Response to Congestion
### Author(s):
- Christopher M. Rump
- Shaler Stidham
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
We consider the stability of the equilibrium arrival rate and equilibrium admission price at a service facility, using a generalization of an input-pricing model introduced by Dewan and Mendelson and further examined by Stidham. At the equilibrium, the marginal value of service equals the admission price, that is, the sum of the admission fee and the expected delay cost. Stability means (roughly) that the system returns to the equilibrium after a perturbation, assuming the customers base their join/balk decisions on previous prices. We extend the discrete-time, dynamic-system pricing model of Stidham to allow adaptive expectations in which customers predict the future price based on a convex combination of the current price and the previous prediction. We show that this can lead to chaotic behavior when the equilibrium is unstable. That is, the price and arrival rate can follow aperiodic orbits, which appear to be completely random. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for observed variations in the mean arrival rate to a queueing system, which are often modeled by means of a random exogenous (e.g., Markovian) environment process.

## 9. Guided Local Search with Shifting Bottleneck for Job Shop Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Egon Balas
- Alkis Vazacopoulos
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
Many recently developed local search procedures for job shop scheduling use interchange of operations, embedded in a simulated annealing or tabu search framework. We develop a new variable depth search procedure, GLS (Guided Local Search), based on an interchange scheme and using the new concept of neighborhood trees. Structural properties of the neighborhood are used to guide the search in promising directions. While this procedure competes successfully with others even as a stand-alone, a hybrid procedure that embeds GLS into a Shifting Bottleneck framework and takes advantage of the differences between the two neighborhood structures proves to be particularly efficient. We report extensive computational testing on all the problems available from the literature.

## 10. Note. The Role of Returns Policies in Pricing and Inventory Decisions for Catalogue Goods
### Author(s):
- Hamilton Emmons
- Stephen M. Gilbert
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1998
### Abstract:
Manufacturers often use returns policies to encourage retailers to stock and price items more aggressively. We focus on the effect that such policies have on both a retailer's and a manufacturer's profits when the retailer must commit prior to the selling season to both a stocking quantity and a price at which to sell an item. Such a commitment is often necessary for retailers who sell primarily through catalogues.
