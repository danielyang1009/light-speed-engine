## 1. Information Technology and Time-Based Competition in Financial Markets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
This paper studies time-based competition in imperfect securities markets, linking IT investment decisions, information processing delays, and trading strategies. At the IT investment stage, traders trade off the cost of IT against their anticipated trading profits. At the trading stage, each trader devises a trading strategy based on his new information while taking into account the impact of both his own trades and those of other traders in the market. Our results illustrate how traders react to market imperfections due to trading costs and information processing delays, and how superior traders convert a timeliness advantage into higher trading profits. They also shed light on the relationship between the price adjustment process and traders' information processing delays. Timeliness imposes an interesting structure on trader competition: traders with longer information processing delays trade less frequently, submit smaller orders and enjoy lower profits per trade. Our analysis of traders' IT investment decisions demonstrates how factors such as IT costs, number of traders, and the frequency and nature of new information affect the level of IT investments. We further illustrate how improved IT infrastructure translates into competitive advantage.

## 2. Testing New Direct Marketing Offerings: The Interplay of Management Judgment and Statistical Models
### Author(s):
- Vicki G. Morwitz
- David C. Schmittlein
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
The launch of a new product or service via direct marketing is nearly always preceded by a test of that offering. Such a live test, conducted with a subset of the entire list of customer prospects, can sometimes be useful in a go/no-go decision regarding a full-scale launch of the offering. More commonly, the test is used to direct the offering more effectively toward the market segments that appear most promising. Specifically, test results are used and useful to determine whether a particular rental list of customer prospects should indeed be rented, and (for both rental and in-house lists) which specific customer segments should be contacted with the offering.

## 3. Economics of Product Development by Users: The Impact of Sticky Local Information
### Author(s):
- Eric von Hippel
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
Those who solve more of a given type of problem tend to get better at itwhich suggests that problems of any given type should be brought to specialists for a solution. However, in this paper we argue that agency-related costs and information transfer costs (sticky local information) will tend drive the locus of problem-solving in the opposite directionaway from problem-solving by specialist suppliers, and towards those who directly benefit from a solution and who have difficult-to-transfer local information about a particular application being solved, such as the direct users of a product or service. We examine the actual location of design activities in two fields in which custom products are produced by mass-customization methods: application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and computer telephony integration (CTI) systems. In both, we find that users rather than suppliers are the actual designers of the application-specific portion of the product types examined. We offer anecdotal evidence that the pattern of user-based customization we have documented in these two fields is in fact quite general, and we discuss implications for research and practice.

## 4. Improving Decision Making by Means of a Marketing Decision Support System
### Author(s):
- Gerrit H. van Bruggen

### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
Marketing decision makers are confronted with an increasing amount of information. This leads to a complex decision environment that may cause decision makers to lapse into using mental-effort-reducing heuristics such as anchoring and adjustment. In an experimental study, we find that the use of a marketing decision support system (MDSS) increases the effectiveness of marketing decision makers. An MDSS is effective because it assists its users in identifying the important decision variables and, subsequently, making better decisions based on those variables. Decision makers using an MDSS are also less susceptible to applying the anchoring and adjustment heuristic and, therefore, show more variation in their decisions in a dynamic environment. Low-analytical decision makers and decision makers operating under low time pressure especially benefit from using an MDSS.

## 5. Similarity Judgments in Choice Under Uncertainty: A Reinterpretation of the Predictions of Regret Theory
### Author(s):
- Jonathan W. Leland
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
The Regret theory of Loomes and Sugden (1982) predicts choice anomalies implied by other alternatives to expected utility (e.g., violations of the independence axiom). It also makes unique and controversial predictions regarding the rational violation of stochastic dominance and invariance. All these predictions depend critically on assumptions regarding the statistical independence or dependence of the available alternatives. None of the predictions depend on the framing or representation of the alternatives. Leland (1994) shows that a model of choice based on similarity judgments predicts choices implied by Regret theory. In contrast to Regret theory, however, these predictions depend critically on the way the choices are framed and not on the dependence or independence of the alternatives. This paper presents experimental results indicating that the frequencies with which violations of independence, dominance, and invariance occur are, in most cases, insensitive to the statistical dependence or independence of the alternatives but sensitive to the way the choices are presented. These findings support the hypothesis that such behaviors arise as a consequence of reliance upon similarity judgments.

## 6. A Minimax Portfolio Selection Rule with Linear Programming Solution
### Author(s):
- Martin R. Young
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
A new principle for choosing portfolios based on historical returns data is introduced; the optimal portfolio based on this principle is the solution to a simple linear programming problem. This principle uses minimum return rather than variance as a measure of risk. In particular, the portfolio is chosen that minimizes the maximum loss over all past observation periods, for a given level of return. This objective function avoids the logical problems of a quadratic (nonmonotone) utility function implied by mean-variance portfolio selection rules. The resulting minimax portfolios are diversified; for normal returns data, the portfolios are nearly equivalent to those chosen by a mean-variance rule. Framing the portfolio selection process as a linear optimization problem also makes it feasible to constrain certain decision variables to be integer, or 0-1, valued; this feature facilitates the use of more complex decision-making models, including models with fixed transaction charges and models with Boolean-type constraints on allocations.

## 7. Optimal Batch Provisioning to Customers Subject to a Delay-Limit
### Author(s):
- Menachem Berg
- Frank van der Duyn Schouten
- Jorg Jansen
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
This work deals with batch provisioning and order aggregation. Two examples are: (i) a manufacturer that has to deliver items to customers in a remote destination, and (ii) a company that provides repair and replacement service to its clients. In both cases the remoteness of customers suggests order aggregationa batch delivery in the first example, and a batch-visits journey in the other; the alternative is to provide individual services to customers. A key element is a contractual obligation of the company to provide service within an agreed delay-limit, and in that view the main decision problem is to determine the moments at which a batch service should be executed. That decision would depend on: (random) demand-arrival patterns, the costs associated with the two service modes (batch and individual), as well as the model used to describe operating conditions.

## 8. Discrete Lotsizing and Scheduling by Batch Sequencing
### Author(s):
- Carsten Jordan
- Andreas Drexl
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
The discrete lotsizing and scheduling problem for one machine with sequence-dependent setup times and setup costs is solved as a single machine scheduling problem, which we term the batch sequencing problem. The relationship between the lotsizing problem and the batch sequencing problem is analyzed. The batch sequencing problem is solved with a branch & bound algorithm which is accelerated by bounding and dominance rules. The algorithm is compared with recently published procedures for solving variants of the DLSP and is found to be more efficient if the number of items is not large.

## 9. An Exact Algorithm for the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem Based on a New Mathematical Formulation
### Author(s):
- Aristide Mingozzi
- Vittorio Maniezzo
- Salvatore Ricciardelli
- Lucio Bianco
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider the Project Scheduling Problem with resource constraints, where the objective is to minimize the project makespan. We present a new 0-1 linear programming formulation of the problem that requires an exponential number of variables, corresponding to all feasible subsets of activities that can be simultaneously executed without violating resource or precedence constraints. Different relaxations of the above formulation are used to derive new lower bounds, which dominate the value of the longest path on the precedence graph and are tighter than the bound proposed by Stinson et al. (1978).

## 10. On the Equivalence of General and Specific Control in Organizations
### Author(s):
- Hans Gersbach
### Published:
- 1 May 1998
### Abstract:
Most principal-agent relationships in firms are multidimensional. In the presence of multiple tasks and multiple performance signals, the contract between principal and agent not only has to motivate the agent, but also has to direct the agent to allocate effort among different tasks. The value of efforts for a specific task accrues not only through the principal's expected returns, but also through its contribution to overall risk, and therefore to the risk diversification of the task portfolio. Hence, if the agent is risk-averse, multitask relationships can be considered as a portfolio problem coupled with incentive constraints.
