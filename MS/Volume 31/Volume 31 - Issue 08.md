## 1. Subjective Stochastic Dominance, Put Writing, and Stock Purchases with Extensions to Option Pricing and Portfolio Composition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
Initially an investor has the choice of two risky assets, writing a European put option or buying the underlying share. Under broad conditions a risk averse investor will be subjectively better off writing the put. When homogeneous expectations are invoked, an upper bound for the put premium is obtained. A numerical example using the lognormal density function illustrates the broad conditions for risk-averters subjectively preferring the put writing strategy. Additional conditions permit this preference for writing puts to be extended to the portfolio context. Transactions costs only reinforce this preference in the one-period horizon considered.

## 2. The Dynamics of Prices and Market Shares Over the Product Life Cycle
### Author(s):
- Birger Wernerfelt
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
We analyze a duopoly through a differential game, in which the players set prices as functions of time. Under reasonable assumptions, we find that prices first decline, then increase. The market share of the biggest firm grows initially but decreases later. It is demonstrated that a firm may growth maximize early, but never late, in the product life cycle. Finally we show that only the low price firm will pay for informative advertising, whereas both firms will pay for persuasive advertising, though less if their market shares are very different.

## 3. Investment Planning and Arm's Length Control in a Nationalised Industry
### Author(s):
- Spyros K. Lioukas
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
Applying a relatively decentralised system of control which would keep state-owned enterprises (SOE) at arm's length from ministerial departments has been a stated policy for many governments around the world. However, the specific controls typically used for implementing this policy have seldom been successful. The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate certain of these controls, drawing upon the British system of arm's length control of nationalised industries. In order to delimit the problem the paper cuts across the government-SOE relationship from the perspective of investment planning. Using primary information from the capital investment process in a particular nationalised industry, the paper searches for evidence on whether and in what ways existing controls have not been successful.

## 4. On the Joint Decisions of R&D and Technology Adoption
### Author(s):
- Tom K. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
This paper attempts to bridge the gap between R&D models that do not consider technology adoption decisions and technology adoption models that do not consider R&D decisions. It develops and analyzes a decision-theoretic model on the joint decisions of R&D and technology adoption of a firm.

## 5. The Effects of Task Size and Similarity on the Decision Behavior of Bank Loan Officers

### Published:

### Abstract:
Research on decision-making behavior has shown that decision strategies used by individuals are contingent upon the characteristics of the task. For example, as the task size (i.e., the number of alternatives and/or the number of dimensions describing each alternative) increases, individuals tend to quickly eliminate alternatives that do not meet a criterion level for any dimension (i.e., they adopt a noncompensatory decision strategy, in which a high value on one dimension cannot offset or compensate for a low value on another dimension). Most of this research has involved consumers making buying decisions. The purpose of the research reported here was to determine if contingent decision behavior extends to experts (experienced bank loan officers) making business decisions (loan decisions). In this study two task characteristics (task size, and similarity of loan profiles describing alternatives) were varied in a bank loan decision context. Two process tracing methods (information boards and think-aloud verbal protocol analysis) were used to obtain evidence of how eleven bank loan officers made choices among alternative loan candidates. Of particular interest was the effect that changes in task characteristics had on loan officers' decision strategies. The results indicated that when faced with tasks of increasing size, loan officers adapted their behavior in a manner consistent with an increased use of noncompensatory decision strategies. In contrast, when the loan profiles of candidate companies were similar loan officers exhibited an increased use of compensatory strategies. It was also found that when both the task size and similarity of alternatives were varied loan officers adapted their behavior as if they processed these characteristics serially. These results indicate that contingent behavior associated with the two types of task characteristics may be quite different. A priori, there was reason to believe that expert loan officers would not exhibit contingent decision behavior. The fact that their decision strategies were contingent upon task characteristics has important implications for managerial practice and research. First, the results have design implications for information and decision support systems for lending institutions. Second, future research should investigate the consequences of serial processing of task characteristics.

## 6. An Autoregressive Process for Beta Random Variables
### Author(s):
- Ed McKenzie
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
Two stationary first-order autoregressive processes with Beta marginal distributions are presented. They are both linear, additive processes but the coefficients are Beta random variables. Their autocorrelation functions are investigated: one is positive and the other alternates in sign. The usefulness of the models in simulation is discussed. The Bivariate Beta distributions of two consecutive observations are considered in some detail. Several examples are given, including a Bivariate Uniform process which is also examined in detail. The relationship of these Bivariate Beta distributions to the Dirichlet distribution is discussed.

## 7. Investing in Reduced Setups in the EOQ Model
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
This paper is motivated by the observation that the Japanese have devoted much time and energy to decreasing setup costs in their manufacturing processes and that there has been little in the way of a formal framework available to use to think about such efforts. The object of this paper is to begin to provide such a framework. The framework developed identifies only one aspect of the advantages of reducing setups, namely reduced inventory related operating costs. The other advantages, such as improved quality control, flexibility, and increased effective capacity, are not accounted for in this paper. Nevertheless, substantial reductions in setups may be warranted based solely on the benefits identified in this paper. The approach taken here introduces an investment cost associated with changing the (current) setup level and adds a per unit time amortization of this cost to the other costs identified in the standard EOQ model. The general problem becomes that of minimizing the sum of a convex and a concave function. In two special cases, the minimization can be carried out explicitly. In one of these cases, numerous interpretations of the results are made, including comparisons of Japanese and American practices. For example, holding other parameters constant, there is a critical sales level such that investment is made in reducing setups if and only if the sales rate is above that level. When such investment is made, the optimal lot size is independent of the sales rate. The paper also addresses the joint selection of the setup cost and the sales rate. Selection of the sales rate is seen as incorporating explicit production and holding costs into the classical monopolists pricing problem. An explicit solution is obtained for the model postulated.

## 8. Allocation of Servers for Stochastic Service Stations with One Overflow Station
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
As one of its services, the Bell System provides microwave and cable transmission equipment for the transmission of news, sports and special-event TV programs from sites that do not have permanent transmission facilities. This paper describes a model for determining quantities of this TV equipment for service stations located throughout the country. This is actually a fundamental model for allocating servers (equipment in our case) for a stochastic service system consisting of several multiserver stations with one multiserver overflow station. The flows of customers to the initial stations are independent Poisson processes, and if a customer arrives at a station when all of its servers are busy, it is either served at the overflow station or denied service, depending on whether an overflow-server is available or not. The service times are exponential random variables. There are holding costs for having the servers in the system and costs for the services, depending on where they are done. We present a myopic nonlinear programming algorithm that finds numbers of servers for the stations that serve a desired percentage of customers at near-minimum cost. As part of our analysis, we show how Hayward's and Wilkinson's approximations for the blocking probability at the overflow station extend to heterogeneous service rates.

## 9. An Adaptive Filtering Procedure for Estimating Regression Quantiles
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1985
### Abstract:
Applications of reliability theory and some forms of chance-constrained programming need real-time, nonstationary estimates of regression quantiles to trigger preventive actions, thereby avoiding undesirable system states. We have designed the Quantile Estimation Procedure (QEP) for this purpose. QEP is a new adaptive filter that nonparametrica11y estimates time-varying parameters of multivariate regression quantiles. Results of Monte Carlo tests show that QEP provides accurate estimates for a range of stochastic processes. Falling within this range is the case study of this paper on monitoring compliance with short-term air quality standards.
