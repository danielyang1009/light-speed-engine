### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
Based on a sample of 80 firms, this paper examines the risk/return performance of related and unrelated diversified firms at the level of accounting data. The results suggest that although on the average related diversified firms outperform unrelated diversified firms, related diversification offers no guarantee of a favorable risk/return performance. (Many low performers are related diversifiers.) In fact, different diversification strategies can result in similar risk/return performance. However, a favorable risk/return performance is extremely hard to achieve with unrelated diversification. The study identifies diversified firms that have managed to simultaneously reduced risks and increase returns. The results indicate that these firms differ from other firms on some managerially useful dimensions. The differences suggest clues to guide other diversified firms to improve their risk/return performance.

## 2. A New Measure of Attributable Risk for Public Health Applications
### Author(s):
- Louis A. Cox, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
A persistent conceptual problem in the theory of risk accounting and risk analysis methodology is that of allocating or attributing a risk among the joint causes or factors producing it. When multiple factors interact, the especially difficult problem of risk externalities arises. Drawing on related work in the mathematical theory of games that seeks solutions to similar philosophical and conceptual problems, this paper proposes a method for solving the risk attribution problem. The proposed solution is justified on the grounds that it is the unique risk attribution function satisfying three reasonable principles, or axioms, of risk accounting. A mathematical framework for formulating risk attribution problems, and several possible applications, are also discussed.

## 3. Parallel Funding of R&D Tasks with Probabilistic Outcomes
### Author(s):
- Jonathan F. Bard
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem commonly faced by R&D managers of funding redundant R&D tasks across several stages or components of a project. In the proposed methodology it is assumed that task outcomes are random, but that their distribution can be determined from engineering inputs. In order to account for individual preferences a utility function is used to measure overall project results, and hence guide the decisions at each stage. The problem is formulated as a probabilistic network and solved by means of a heuristic comprising simulation and dynamic programming. Although computational experience is limited, the results obtained from a number of examples associated with the development of a photovoltaic solar module were quite promising; that is, the heuristic always found the optimal investment plan. In general, computational times were minimal when compared to data collection efforts, with the latter perhaps being the principal hurdle to full implementation. The sponsoring organization, however, felt that the unified approach offered by the methodology represented a major improvement over current analytic techniques.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
The radio frequency communication environment, for example, in large vessels, aircraft, space vehicles, and satellites, has become increasingly complex as more and more transmitters, receivers, and corresponding communication nets are being added to perform multiple functions. This paper discusses some of the problems faced by a decision maker in managing a communication network. A particular and important problem worth investigating occurs when different frequencies are simultaneously active in a network. This may cause various types of interference creating a disturbance in communication. One interesting and important type of interference, which may be expressed mathematically, is intermodulation. A typical problem scenario is thus to assign frequencies to the different nets of the network so that intermodulation interference is within desirable limits. A second problem is to add a net to an existing network, with previously assigned frequencies, so that the new net produces an acceptable level of intermodulation interference. Besides these, other related problems may be defined. For many problem scenarios, related integer nonlinear programming models may be derived. These models, corresponding algorithms and related software are discussed.

## 5. A Note on Stochastic Shop Models in Which Jobs have the Same Processing Requirements on Each Machine
### Author(s):
- Michael Pinedo
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
We consider stochastic models for flow shops, job shops and open shops in which the work required by job j is the same at each machine, being a random variable Wj. Because machines operate at different speeds, Si, the processing time of job j at machine i is Wj/Si,. It is the main result of this note that in a flow shop where the machine speeds increase (decrease) from the first to last machine and the workload distributions are ordered by a likelihood ratio criterion, then the makespan of the jobs is stochastically minimized by processing the jobs in the order of least to greatest (greatest to least) workload.

## 6. An Algorithm for a Class of Nonconvex Programming Problems with Nonlinear Fractional Objectives
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
In public policy decision making and in capital planning fractional criterion functions occur. For a given set of desirable target values (goals) i, this paper develops an algorithm for solving a nonconvex programming problem of the type: Minxs Maxi{i(fi(x)/gi(x)  i), i = 1, , m} where fi are convex functions, gi are concave functions over the convex subset S of Rn and i are nondecreasing gauge functions. Here i() is the penalty incurred whenever the fractional objective fi/gi deviates from the target value i, the problem is then to choose an x that minimizes the maximum penalty incurred.

## 7. Focused Scheduling in Proportionate Flowshops
### Author(s):
- Peng Si Ow
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
The proportionate flowshop is a special class of flowshops in which the operation times of jobs are proportionate, e.g., because of differences in the speeds of machines. In this paper, we make use of a special property of proportionate flowshops, namely that the bottleneck in the shop is almost always the one where job operations are proportionately longer than for any other operations (the slowest machine) to demonstrate a scheduling procedure that makes scheduling decisions by focusing on the information and consequences at the bottleneck resource. This is called the Focused Approach. The scheduling objective is to minimize the total tardiness cost of jobs, where each job may have a different tardiness cost. The decision rule used in this approach is the Idle Time Rule whose development is described in this paper. The approach was tested using approximately proportionate flowshops of different sizes. The results obtained for small 3-machine problems were compared against the optimal permutation schedules obtained using Branch-and-Bound and was found to be near-optimal. For larger problems using 4- and 8-machine flowshops, the results were compared to five other scheduling methods. The focused approach performed far better than those other scheduling methods not only in minimizing tardiness cost, but also minimizing the percentage of tardy jobs and the percentage of processing time to work-in-process time. Finally, the two-product shop where the bottleneck was dynamic was studied and, using a simple strategy to track bottlenecks, the focused approach was again found to perform well compared with other heuristic methods.

## 8. On Approximate Queueing Models of Dynamic Job Shops
### Author(s):
- J. A. Buzacott
- J. G. Shanthikumar
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a class of job shops with a dispatch area and a machine shop, where operational controls are exercised at the dispatch area as well as at the machine shop. For such dynamic job shops with these two levels of control, there are three categories of models. They are (1) pseudo-static, (2) pure dynamic, and (3) pseudo-dynamic. In this paper approximate queueing models are developed for pure dynamic and pseudo-dynamic job shops; open queueing network models and controlled arrival single stage queueing models, respectively. The accuracy of the open queueing network models and their use are illustrated. An example indicative of the possible accuracy of the controlled arrival single stage queueing models is also given.

## 9. Analysis of Names and Relationships Among Data Elements
### Author(s):
- C. S. Sankar
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
When making decisions, managers like to obtain pertinent information quickly and accurately from the information systems in an organization. But, often, different answers are obtained, depending on how the information request is phrased or from which information system the information is requested. In order to correct this problem, the system analyst and data base administrator have to resolve any conflicts in defining elements, their names and their relationships before computerized information systems are designed. A syntax method, described in this paper, has been developed to handle this process. This method standardizes names and mathematical relationships of elements. These standard data elements become the input to most system analysis methods facilitating the design of computerized information systems.

## 10. Rationality in the Analysis of Behavioral Simulation Models
### Author(s):
- John D. W. Morecroft
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1985
### Abstract:
An important task in the analysis of a behavioral simulation model is to explain clearly how the models organizational assumptions lead to its simulated behavior. All too often, model-based arguments involve an uncomfortable leap of logic between equations and consequences. This paper proposes two methods of analysis, premise description and partial model testing, which provide stepping stones between model equations and their simulated consequences. Premise description examines the bounded rationality of policies or decision functions in the model, pointing out the process and cognitive limitations assumed in decisionmaking. Partial model tests expose the intended rationality of smalt combinations of policies, showing that policies produce sensible actions with respect to their premises. The application of those methods is illustrated with a simulation model of a sales organization in which sales-force productivity is prone to decline. The behavior of productivity is traced to dysfunctional interactions between objectives, overtime, and salesforce motivation.
