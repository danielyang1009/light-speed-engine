## 1. Application of Sequential Testing to Motor Vehicle Emission Certification
### Author(s):
- George Miller
- Robert L. Farrell
- Stephen M. Pollock
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
A new structure for economically-based sequential inspection plans is developed for use in motor vehicle emission testing. The structure allows for multiple attributes, multiple sources of randomness, misclassification of inspected items, and adjustment of cost parameters to produce desirable classical properties. Specific sequential plans are developed for the Environmental Protection Agency's motor vehicle certification program and are applied retrospectively to vehicles tested in the past. The use of such plans in the past could have saved resources while resulting in no significant degradation in performance. Both the structure and computational methods used have potential application to other sampling inspection problems.

## 2. Successive Linear Programming at Exxon
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Baker
- Leon S. Lasdon
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
Successive Linear Programming (SLP) has been used extensively in the refining and petrochemical industries for over 20 years. This paper concentrates on some recent work at Exxon to unify the treatment of nonlinear terms in mostly linear models. We first discuss the source of nonlinearities in refining and petrochemical problems and propose a multiplicative formulation for the linearized subproblems to be solved by SLP. We then describe a SLP algorithm which is shown to be related to the concept of trust regions. Finally, we present an example formulation and computational results for a series of large industrial applications.

## 3. NoteMulti-Activity Facility Design and Location Problems
### Author(s):
- Umit Akinc
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of optimally locating multi-activity facilities whose activity compositions are also to be determined. It is assumed that there are fixed costs associated both with establishing facilities and with including specific activities at the locations. This problem is examined under alternative assumptions concerning the facility capacities. Efficient branch-and-bound algorithms are developed, and extensive computational results are given.

## 4. Analyzing Personnel Rotation in the Navy
### Author(s):
- Donald E. Maurer
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to analyze personnel rotation in the Navy. Although primarily a sea-going force, the Navy must periodically rotate personnel to shore duty. The effective administration of this policy promotes morale and reduces attrition. It also enables managers to control the distribution of personnel, so that programmed changes in force manning levels can be implemented gradually without disrupting individual career development. In order to accomplish this, however, Navy planners must understand the effect alterations in individual parameters will have on the system. A simplified mathematical model is developed and analyzed to help clarify these interrelationships. The results of this analysis are applied to answer some important questions concerning the present enlisted force.

## 5. Employing Financial Futures to Increase the Return on Near Cash (Treasury Bill) Investments
### Author(s):
- Edwin J. Elton
- Martin J. Gruber
- Joel C. Rentzler
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to formulate and test a decision model to increase the return on a pool of liquid assets through the use of Treasury bill futures contracts. Recent literature has documented inefficiencies in the pricing of T-bill futures. These inefficiencies can be exploited to increase the return on a portfolio of T-bills without affecting the maturity of the portfolio. The solution technique used is dynamic programming. The results of applying a dynamic programming algorithm parameterized on available data to trade in real time are presented. The rules lead to increased returns.

## 6. Uncertainty and Technical Communication Patterns
### Author(s):
- James W. Brown
- James M. Utterback
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
This paper examines the relationship between research and development peoples' perceptions of uncertainty in their firm's competitive environment and their patterns of technical communication. Measures of both these attributes of six R&D groups, two in each of three industries, are reported and analyzed here. Technical people who saw the world (competitors, suppliers, customers, technology and regulations) outside their firm as more uncertain also were found to seek greater contact with sources of information outside their firms. The gatekeeper phenomenon was found to be more pronounced, but less formal and less well defined in these firms. Gatekeepers in general were found to perceive a higher level of uncertainty than others in all six firms.

## 7. Innovation in a Newly Industrializing Country: A Multiple Discriminant Analysis
### Author(s):
- Linsu Kim
- Youngbae Kim
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
This article examines 42 innovative firms in a newly industrializing country, Korea. It identifies different patterns of innovation associated with four types of firms, which is categorized by two variables: the source of initiation and the local availability of related foreign products. Bivariate analyses suggest that innovation patterns are distinctly different for Type I firms (user initiated and related foreign products locally available) and Type IV firms (innovator initiated and no related foreign products locally available). Type I firms use and benefit most from close interactions with customers and visits to the domestic users of related foreign products, while Type IV firms benefit most from the overseas observation of foreign suppliers and the assistance of local R&D institutes. The other two groups are more closely related but still different from the above two groups. The results of a multiple discriminant analysis are supportive of the patterns which emerged in the bivariate analyses. It was also found that majority of important and crucial information to solve technical problems were transferred free of charge from abroad through informal mechanisms rather than formal collaboration with foreign firms. The findings suggest that different situations call for different approaches to make innovations successful.

## 8. The Managerial Economics of Civil Litigation
### Author(s):
- Ferdinand K. Levy
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
As the United States has become a more litigation society, executives are finding more of their time and their firms' resources consumed by litigation. This paper attempts to assist their decision making with regard to legal matters by looking at the following questions:
Under what conditions should a potential plaintiff litigate a specific issue?
Under what conditions should a defendant faced with a lawsuit respond forcefully to it?
How can legal expenses be budgeted and controlled by both sides?
What are the most likely conditions under which both plaintiff and defendant would be willing to seek out of court settlement?

## 9. M-Labeled Digraphs: An Aid to the Use of Structural and Simulation Models
### Author(s):
- James R. Burns
- Wayland H. Winstead
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
M-labeled digraphs are defined and a technique for determination of the sign of sequences in such digraphs is presented. Conditions under which the sign of a sequence can be determined are derived. This work is motivated by the need to assess the structural effect of an input upon the endogenous quantities of an M-labeled digraph. A technique for comparing and combining the effects of structurally redundant inputs is presented. The theoretical development is followed by application to a prototypical Forrester model involving a population sector interactant with a housing sector.

## 10. On Competition to Join a Simple Queueing System Before the Facility Opens
### Author(s):
- Colin E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
A single server provides FIFO services commencing at time 0. Each member of a population of N potential customers must decide whether or not to arrive at the facility. Customers choosing to arrive must do so no later than time 0. This paper studies the benefit to customers: the value of service received minus the cost of waiting time.

## 11. NoteA Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Joint Replenishment Under General Order Cost Functions
### Author(s):
- Meir J. Rosenblatt
- Moshe Kaspi
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
The multi-item joint replenishment problem is generalized to allow ordering costs to be dependent on the specific items jointly supplied. A fixed cycle approach is examined in which all the items of a group are always jointly replenished. A dynamic programming algorithm is developed for partitioning the items into groups, each with its own fixed cycle time, resulting in an optimal fixed cycle replenishment policy.

## 12. NoteResponse to Equilibrium Strategies for Final-Offer Arbitration: There is No Median Convergence
### Author(s):
- Gerald Rabow
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
For an arbitrator model different from the one in the referenced paper, final-offer arbitration (FOA) is very effective. This suggests that strategies for conducting successful FOA may be available to arbitrators.
In the above quoted paper, Brams and Merrill (Brams, Steven J., Samuel Merrill, III. 1983. Equilibrium strategies for final-offer arbitration: there is no median convergence. Management Sci.29 (August) 927941.) quote a statement on final-offer arbitration (FOA):
The theory which underlies final-offer arbitration is quite simple. If the arbitrator or panel was permitted to select only one or the other of the parties' final offers, with no power to make a choice anywhere in between, it was expected that the logic of the procedure would force negotiating parties to continue moving closer together in search of a position that would be most likely to receive neutral sympathy. Ultimately, so the argument went, they would come so close together that they would almost inevitably find their own settlement.
and then refute it as follows:
One purpose of our article is to show that there is little truth to this theory: divergence, rather than convergence, of equilibrium strategies is the norm.

## 14. NoteA Note on Optimal and Near Optimal Price and Advertising Strategies
### Author(s):
- Ram C. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1985
### Abstract:
In this paper Optimal and Near Optimal Price and Advertising Strategies, Welam (Welam, Ulf P. 1982. Optimal and near optimal prize and advertising strategies. Management Sci.28 13131327.) considers a model which is similar to a model analyzed by Gould (Gould, John P. 1970. Diffusion processes and optimal advertising policy. E. S. Phelps et al., eds. Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory. W. W. Norton, 338368.) in his work on optimal advertising policies. The main difference between the two papers is that while Welam's analysis is in discrete time, Gould's is in continuous time. The equivalence of the two analyses is easy to establish and is contained in Rao (Rao, Ram C. 1983. A note on optimal advertising strategies. Working paper, University of Texas, Dallas, January.).
