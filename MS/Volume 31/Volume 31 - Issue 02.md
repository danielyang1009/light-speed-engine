## 1. A Robust Credit Screening Model Using Categorical Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
Motivated by an application in a public utility, the credit screening problem is re-examined from a decision theoretic viewpoint. The relationships between several alternative problem formulations are explored, and compared to the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) approach. Several mathematical programming based solution methods are proposed when the data are binary, and an efficient algorithm is developed for the case when the screening function must also have binary weights. Actual results of both the mathematical programming and LDA methods are presented and compared. The resulting mathematical programming rules are effective, robust, and flexible to administer. Practical advantages of the resulting n out of N type rules are discussed. These screening rules have been widely implemented by a major public utility and have resulted in substantial benefits to the utility and to the public.

## 2. Control: Organizational and Economic Approaches
### Author(s):
- Kathleen M. Eisenhardt
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
Organizational design often focuses on structural alternatives such as matrix, decentralization, and divisionalization. However, control variables (e.g., reward structures, task characteristics, and information systems) offer a more flexible approach. The purpose of this paper is to explore these control variables for organizational design. This is accomplished by integration and testing of two perspectives, organization theory and economics, notably agency theory. The resulting hypotheses link task characteristics, information systems, and business uncertainty to behavior vs. outcome based control strategy. These hypothesized linkages are examined empirically in a field study of the compensation practices for retail salespeople in 54 stores. The findings are that task programmability is strongly related to the choice of compensation package. The amount of behavioral measurement, the cost of measuring outcomes, and the uncertainty of the business also affect compensation. The findings have management implications for the design of compensation and reward packages, performance evaluation systems, and control systems, in general. Such systems should explicitly consider the task, the information system in place to measure performance, and the riskiness of the business. More programmed tasks require behavior based controls while less programmed tasks require more elaborate information systems or outcome based controls.

## 3. Modeling Data and Process Quality in Multi-Input, Multi-Output Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Donald P. Ballou
- Harold L. Pazer
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general model to assess the impact of data and process quality upon the outputs of multi-user information-decision systems. The data flow/data processing quality control model is designed to address several dimensions of data quality at the collection, input, processing and output stages.

## 4. Capital Rationing and Organizational Slack in Capital Budgeting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
This paper reconciles three stylized facts about capital budgeting in firms and shows that they are tied to the presence of asymmetric information among the several members of the firm, each with his or her own objectives and decisions. The facts of interest are:

## 5. Capacity Expansion of Power Generation Systems with Uncertainty in the Prices of Primary Energy Resources
### Author(s):
- Nissan Levin
- Asher Tishler
- Jacob Zahavi
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
In capacity expansion studies of power generation systems, the uncertainty in the prices of the primary energy resources is a major concern. The approach presented in this paper accounts for this uncertainty by mapping the probability distribution of the installed capacity for any given distribution of the fuel prices. Given the probability density function and the cumulative distribution of the installed capacity, a variety of performance measures is derived, including the expected value, the mode, and the variance of the installed capacity, and the expected total costs. Results are obtained analytically for a 2-unit system using a breakeven point analysis approach to find the optimal mix for any given set of fuel prices under the assumption of normally distributed primary energy prices.

## 6. The Role of Linear Recursive Estimators in Time Series Forecasting
### Author(s):
- D. J. Pack
- D. H. Pike
- D. J. Downing
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
This paper presents a descriptive synthesis of a number of a linear recursive estimator (LRE) procedures for time series forecasting, i.e., procedures which involve parameter updates proportional to the last period forecast error. It is stressed that both constant and variable parameter procedures exist among LRE's. General requirements for stability of parameter estimates are given, as are general forms for parameter estimate covariance matrices that appear in forecast variance determinations. Procedures explicitly considered are the Kalman filter, dynamic autoregression, the Carbone-Longini adaptive estimation procedure, generalized least squares, Widrow's least mean square, and the Makridakis-Wheelwright generalized adaptive filtering.

## 7. Optimal Weighted lp Norm Parameters for Facilities Layout Distance Characterizations
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Love
- Paul D. Dowling
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
The distances used in certain types of industrial, office or street grid layouts are often assumed to be rectangular. Because of the doubling back effect caused by finite block and facility sizes, actual distances travelled are often much greater than indicated by the l1 norm. In this study the weighted lp norm is fitted to a certain commonly occurring class of layout patterns. The optimal best-fit parameters are reported in addition to other observations which should be useful to users of distance models. The results give strong support for the use of the l1 norm in determining optimal facility locations when travel distances are rectangular and doubling back occurs. However, the l1 norm is not appropriate for modelling actual travel distances under the same circumstances.

### Abstract:
A stochastic PERT network is a directed acyclic network in which the arc lengths are independent random variables with known distributions. A fundamental problem in PERT networks is to identify the activities which are critical to the achievement of the project objectives.

## 9. Using Simulation to Estimate First Passage Distribution
### Author(s):
- Sheldon M. Ross
- Zvi Schechner
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
Consider a discrete time Markov process {Xn, n > 0}. For a given subset  of the state space, consider the problem of using simulation to estimate the number of transitions it takes the process to enter . Using estimators based on the observed hazard, we are able to improve on the usual Monte Carlo estimator. We also consider the problem of estimating the distribution of the first state in,  to be reached, and then extend our results to continuous time.

## 10. Approximating the Equilibrium Behavior of Multi-Server Loss Systems
### Author(s):
- J. P. Jarvis
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
A procedure is given for approximating the equilibrium behavior of multi-server loss systems having distinguishable servers and multiple customer types under light to moderate traffic intensity. Calls are assumed to arrive according to independent Poisson processes for each customer type. General service time distributions which may depend on both server and customer type are allowed. For N servers, the approximation routine consists of a simple iterative procedure in N nonlinear equations. Computational experience with respect to the convergence properties of the iteration and the accuracy of the approximation is given.

## 11. NoteFinding Certain Weakly-Efficient Vertices in Multiple Objective Linear Fractional Programming
### Author(s):
- Harold P. Benson
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1985
### Abstract:
Recently Kornbluth and Steuer have developed a simplex-based algorithm for finding all weakly-efficient vertices of an augmented feasible region of a multiple objective linear fractional programming problem. As part of this algorithm, they presented a method for detecting certain weakly-efficient vertices called break points. In this note we show that the procedure used by Kornbluth and Steuer in this method for computing the numbers needed to find these break points may sometimes fail. We also propose a fail-safe method for computing these numbers and give some computational results with this method.
