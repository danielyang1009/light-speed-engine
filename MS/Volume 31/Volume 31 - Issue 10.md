## 1. Decision Analysis Models for Social Attitudes Toward Inequity
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
Social preferences for equity in the distribution of net benefits are not represented in a cost-benefit study by the sum of the individuals net present values. This paper presents two different decision analysts models for representing such an equity issue. For each model, conditions on the tradeoffs between different individuals are shown to imply that preferences can be represented by a special type of group value function. Procedures are presented by which such a group value function can be determined and used as part of a public policy evaluation.

## 2. Probability Versus Certainty Equivalence Methods in Utility Measurement: Are they Equivalent?
### Author(s):
- John C. Hershey
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
Certainty equivalence (CE) and probability equivalence (PE) methods are the two most frequently used procedures for constructing von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. In this paper, we compare these methods experimentally, using a two-stage within-subject design. By asking subjects first for a CE judgment and later for a related PE judgment (or vice versa), a consistency test is devised which any deterministic expectation model, including those allowing probability transformations, should meet. Using four related experiments, this consistency test is applied separately to gain and loss questions, and to the two sequences of linked equivalence judgments, namely CE-PE and PE-CE. The empirical results reveal serious inconsistencies between the CE and PE responses for each of the four experiments. The extent of discrepancy depends strongly on the subject's initial risk attitude and whether the gain or loss domain is examined. To explain the complex pattern of results, the second part of the paper explores several plausible hypotheses.

## 3. Options on Commodity Forward Contracts
### Author(s):
- Edward O. Thorp
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
We develop formulas for European options on commodity forward contracts. The assumptions and derivations are simple. The qualitative behavior of the formulas is developed for an intuitive overview. The put formula and related ideas were applied to successfully manage a quarter billion dollar hedge of GNMA futures versus standbys.

## 4. Forecasting Trends in Time Series
### Author(s):
- Everette S. Gardner, Jr.
- Ed. Mckenzie
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
Most time series methods assume that any trend will continue unabated, regardless of the forecast lead time. But recent empirical findings suggest that forecast accuracy can be improved by either damping or ignoring altogether trends which have a low probability of persistence. This paper develops an exponential smoothing model designed to damp erratic trends. The model is tested using the sample of 1,001 time series first analyzed by Makridakis et al. Compared to smoothing models based on a linear trend, the model improves forecast accuracy, particularly at long leadtimes. The model also compares favorably to sophisticated time series models noted for good long-range performance, such as those of Lewandowski and Parzen.

## 5. A Multi-Echelon Inventory Model for a Repairable Item with One-for-One Replenishment
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
The problem that we address is to determine the inventory stockage levels in a multi-echelon inventory system for a repairable item. In its simplest form the multi-echelon system consists of a set of operating sites supported by a centrally-located repair depot. Each operating site requires a set of working items and maintains an inventory of spare items. The repair depot also holds an inventory of spare items. Item failures are infrequent and are replaced on a one-for-one basis. In this paper we present an exact model for finding the steady-state distribution of the net inventory level at each site. This model assumes that the failures are generated by a compound Poisson process and that the shipment time from the repair depot to each site is deterministic. No assumptions are made with regard to the repair cycle at the depot. We contrast this model with existing models for these systems. Based on the exact model we present an approximation for the steady-state distribution for the case with ample servers at the repair depot. We show that this approximation is very accurate on a set of test problems.

## 6. An Interactive Decomposable Heuristic for Project Selection
### Author(s):
- Tomislav Mandakovic
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
Decomposable systems, decomposition and 0-1 integer programming techniques are reviewed relative to project selection problems. It is concluded that a heuristic procedure is a suitable way to handle such problems in organizational settings. A hierarchical multiperiod multidimensional model is proposed. Good results are obtained based on an existing heuristic algorithm by Toyoda, by means of a decomposable interactive formulation. Examples and discussions are included that show how the use of this model can improve management decisions. A major advantage of this formulation is its flexibility to handle many different R&D situations, a feature which should increase its usefulness over many other R&D Project Selection Models. The model can be used in a multihierarchy ambience, can use parametric budgeting, and can be used as a control tool. The interactive feature provides the means for improving organizational communications and integrating divergent viewpoints.

## 7. Project Selection Decision Making Linked to a Dynamic Environment
### Author(s):
- G. Edward Fox
- Norman R. Baker
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
A simulation model that attempts to include simplified market and production characteristics of a hypothetical firm and a specific project selection decision mechanism is constructed. Three types of projects are assumed to existprojects whose impact is to increase market share, decrease production cost and increase production capacity. An experiment aimed at two questions is conducted. The questions are (1) Do different market conditions affect project selection decisions and (2) over time, what patterns of project selection emerge. In the model and experiment, an attempt is made to capture the essence of Abernathy and Utterback's model of the innovation process so that it may be applied to more specific settings. Observed project selection patterns over time indicate an apparent relationship between market share increasing and production cost decreasing projects and Abernathy and Utterback's concept of product innovation, and similarly between capacity increasing projects and process innovation.

## 8. Continuous-Review Policies for a Multi-Echelon Inventory Problem with Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):
- Marc A. De Bodt
- Stephen C. Graves
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
This paper considers a multi-stage, serial inventory system. The demand for the end item is stochastic and stationary. The relevant costs include a fixed ordering cost and an echelon inventory holding cost for each stage, and a backordering cost for the end item. The objective is to find a continuous-review inventory control policy that minimizes the expected average costs. We present and analyze an approximate cost model. Our approximation is analogous to that for the traditional single-item, continuous-review inventory model that assumes a reorder-point, reorder-quantity policy. We obtain policies that are natural extensions to those for the single-item model.

## 9. A Lagrangean Based Branch and Bound Algorithm for Single Machine Sequencing with Precedence Constraints to Minimize Total Weighted Completion Time
### Author(s):
- C. N. Potts
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
The single machine sequencing problem is considered in which there are precedence constraints on the jobs. The objective is to minimize the sum of weighted completion times. A lower bound is obtained by successively performing a Lagrangean relaxation of appropriate constraints. Each Lagrange multiplier is chosen to provide the maximum increment to the lower bound subject to retaining the nonnegativity of the coefficients of the variables. When no further suitable constraints can be introduced into the Lagrangean function, the variables having zero cost coefficient are used to obtain a feasible sequence which provides an upper bound. The gap between the lower and upper bound is reduced by removing some constraints from the Lagrangean function and replacing them with others. This lower bounding procedure is used in a branch and bound algorithm. Computational results indicate that the algorithm can satisfactorily solve problems with up to 100 jobs.

## 10. An Improved Successive Linear Programming Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Jianzhong Zhang
- Nae-Heon Kim
- L. Lasdon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1985
### Abstract:
Successive Linear Programming (SLP) algorithms solve nonlinear optimization problems via a sequence of linear programs. They have been widely used, particularly in the oil and chemical industries, beginning with their introduction by Griffith and Stewart of Shell Development Company in 1961. Since then, several applications and variants of SLP have appeared, the most recent being the SLPR algorithm described in this journal in 1982 (Palacios-Gomez et al.). SLP procedures are attractive because they are fairly easy to implement if an efficient, flexible LP code is available, can solve nonseparable as well as separable problems, can be applied to as large a problem as the LP code can handle (often thousands of constraints and variables), and have been successful in many practical applications.
