## 1. The Impact of Interorganizational Manpower Flows on the Innovation Process
### Author(s):
- John E. Ettlie
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
In a study of 56 food processing firms, respondents reported on manpower flows that had an important influence on innovation decision making. Positive gain manpower flows appear to be a relatively rare occurrence. Only 23 (41%) of these 56 firms report any significant, innovation-impact, personnel additions, and 15 of these involve management positions. Four propositions were tested that focus on the relationship between manpower flows and innovative outcomes of an organization, i.e., offering new products and incorporating new processes. Moderate support was found for the proposition that net gain manpower flows are more likely to be related to radical as opposed to incremental process adoption. Evidence suggests that there is an inverted u shaped relationship between, net manpower flows and innovation outcomes. New blood stimulates innovation up to a point after which there is disruption to the innovation process. Adding too many people at once who all have a significant influence on the process may be unwise.

## 2. Optimization of Bank Transit Check Clearing Operations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
The passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 has created a major change in the banking system of the United States, in that the Federal Reserve began charging for its check clearing and collection services September 1, 1981. The result from the passage of this legislation has been major changes in bank check clearing arrangements, in that greater check clearing efficiency is now required to offset the increased clearing costs. This paper describes the development of an integer programming model which has been used to determine the set of clearing arrangements and associated transportation connections that optimizes a banks transit check clearing system in this new environment.

## 3. Consumption Experience and Sales Promotion Expenditure
### Author(s):
- Claes Fornell
- William T. Robinson
- Birger Wernerfelt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
An economic theory of habit formation through consumption learning is developed to explain order differences in relative sales promotion expenditures among brands. The theory applies to consumer brands in equilibrium markets, where consumer information from sources other than advertising, sales promotion, and previous consumption experience is negligible.

## 4. New Polynomial Shortest Path Algorithms and Their Computational Attributes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
This paper presents six new variants of the polynomially bounded Partitioning Shortest Path (PSP) algorithm for finding the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a network. Three of these variants, one for negative arc lengths, but without negative cycles, and two for nonnegative arc lengths, augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called sharp by Shier and Witzgall. The other three variants augment the PSP algorithm to maintain a property called near-sharp for nonnegative arc lengths. Extensive computational testing is presented on one of the sharp variants for nonnegative arc lengths and two of the near-sharp variants. The empirical results based on 4500 test problems with 90 different configurations and three different network topologies indicate that these new algorithms have excellent computational performance characteristics. Based on total solution times for the 4500 test problems, these new algorithms out-perform all other algorithms tested. In addition, one of the near-sharp algorithms strictly dominates all others on all problem topologies tested.

## 5. The Dynamics of Organizational Proximity

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
The proximity among people in an organization is known to exert considerable influence on a variety of organizational outcomes such as performance, stress, and job satisfaction. Early research on proximity in organizations studied pairs of people in job locations that were at fixed distances (e.g., keypunch operators at their work stations). This research procedure ignores three critical features of organizational life. First, people are simultaneously proximate to everyone else in their organization. Second, this proximity changes throughout the day as people move about the organization. Finally, the opportunity and obligation for communication that people perceive by being physically close to others is often more important than the actual physical distance.

## 6. Optimal Compensation for Data-Sharing in Registration Processes
### Author(s):
- Klaus Brockhoff
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
Data-sharing is suggested or required in various registration procedures to avoid parallel testing of possibly dangerous substances. The question arises what the optimal compensation of an imitator to the innovator would be under such conditions. In a first arbitration award a scheme to determine the compensation is given. We develop another scheme on the basis of the Nash-solution for cooperative games. This is discussed with respect to the Shapley value and the core of the game.

## 7. Bayes Solution to Dynamic Inventory Models Under Unknown Demand Distribution
### Author(s):
- Katy S. Azoury
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
This paper considers the periodic review inventory problem for which one or more parameters of the demand distribution are unknown with a known prior distribution chosen from the natural conjugate family. The Bayesian formulation of this problem results in a dynamic program with a multi-dimensional state space. Two models are analysed: the depletive inventory model of consumable items and the nondepletive model of reparable items. For both models and for some specific demand distributions, it is shown that the solution of the Bayesian model can be reduced to that of solving another dynamic program with a one-dimensional state space. Moreover, an explicit form for the optimal Bayesian ordering policy is given in each case.

## 8. Balancing Mixed Model Lines with In-Process Inventories
### Author(s):

- Avraham Shtub
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
This paper deals with mixed-model line balancing; i.e., the problem of combining line balancing with lot sizing in a multi-product environment. Recent developments in the area of multi-echelon production/inventory systems are applied, and algorithms are developed which determine the number of work stations required along the line, the tasks assigned to each station, and the cycle time. The algorithms are designed to minimize total production costs composed of labor costs, inventory carrying costs, and setup costs. Computational results are presented to illustrate the ability of the algorithms to design mixed model lines effectively and efficiently.

## 9. The Optimal Acquisition of Automation to Enhance the Productivity of Labor
### Author(s):
- Cheryl Gaimon
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
Decisions concerning the mix of automation and labor employed by an organization are embedded in the long-term strategic plan since the composition of productive capacity impacts on an organization's ability to survive and compete. In this paper, the optimal mix of automation and labor is identified for automation which acts to enhance the productivity of an organization's workforce. The incentives considered for acquiring automation are increasing the level of output, reducing the high cost of labor, and compensating for a limited supply of labor. Factors explicitly examined by the model include the future long-term goal level of output, costs associated with maintaining the workforce (wages) and automation, and costs associated with changing the levels of workforce and automation. Since the formulation is dynamic so that all exogenous and decision variables may be expressed as functions of time, the effects of technological improvement, increasing wage rates, changing labor supply, and diminishing returns as additional automation is acquired are considered.

## 10. NoteRankings from Round-Robin Tournaments
### Author(s):
- Michael Stob
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1985
### Abstract:
In a December 1983 article in Management Science, Stephen Goddard studies the problem of ranking contestants in a round-robin tournament. He gives objections to the usual method of ranking contestants by number of victories and proposes both an alternative method for ranking contestants and a criterion for determining the fairest ranking. We argue here that his criterion is faulty and, in fact, falls prey to his own objections. We also show that his method, in any event, produces rankings which don't satisfy the criterion. Finally we describe a general class of models of competition which have been proposed to solve this problem and which lead to the usual method of ranking by number of victories.
