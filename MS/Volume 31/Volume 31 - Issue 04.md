## 1. Transactions Costs, Extent of Inefficiencies, Entries and Multiple Wagers in a Racetrack Betting Model
### Author(s):
- Donald B. Hausch
- William T. Ziemba
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
In a previous paper (Management Science, December 1981) Hausch, Ziemba and Rubinstein (HZR) developed a system that demonstrated the existence of a weak market inefficiency in racetrack place and show betting pools. The system appeared to make possible substantial positive profits. To make the system operational, given the limited time available for placing bets, an approximate regression scheme was developed for the Exhibition Park Racetrack in Vancouver for initial betting wealth between $2500 and $7500 and a track take of 17.1%. This paper: (1) extends this scheme to virtually any track and initial wealth level; (2) develops a modified system for multiple horse entries; (3) allows for multiple bets; (4) analyzes the effects of the track take and breakage on profits; (5) presents recent results using this system; and (6) considers the extent of the inefficiency, i.e., how much can be bet before the market becomes efficient?

## 2. Effort and Accuracy in Choice
### Author(s):
- Eric J. Johnson
- John W. Payne
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
Individuals often use several different strategies such as the expected value rule, conjunctive rule, and elimination-by-aspects, to make decisions. It has been hypothesized that strategy selection is, in part, a function of (1) the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate response and (2) the strategy's demand for mental resources or effort. We examine effort and accuracy and their role in strategy selection. Several strategies that may be used to make choices under risk are simulated using a production system framework. This framework allows the estimation of the effort required to use the strategy in a choice environment, while simultaneously measuring its accuracy relative to a normative model. A series of Monte-Carlo studies varied several aspects of the choice environments, including the complexity of the task and the presence or absence of dominated alternatives. These simulations identify strategies which approximate the accuracy of normative procedures while requiring substantially less effort. These results, however, are highly contingent upon characteristics of the task environment. The potential of production system models in understanding task effects in decisions is stressed.

## 3. Beta Instability and Stochastic Market Weights
### Author(s):
- David H. Goldenberg
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
An argument is given for individual firm beta instability based upon the stochastic character of the market weights defining the market portfolio and the constancy of its beta. This argument is generalized to market weighted portfolios and the form of the stochastic process generating betas is linked to that of the market return process. The implications of this analysis for adequacy of models of beta nonstationarity and estimation of betas are considered in light of the available empirical evidence.

## 4. A Linear Dynamic Programming Approach to Irrigation System Management with Depleting Groundwater
### Author(s):
- A. L. Stoecker
- A. Seidmann
- G. S. Lloyd
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
A model for measuring the economic benefits of irrigation system development over a depleting aquifer is presented, along with related methodology for detailed long-range farm planning. The paper considers management issues, such as distribution system configuration, drilling policy, area developed for irrigation, and crop production.

## 5. Implicit Understandings in Channels of Distribution
### Author(s):
- Steven M. Shugan
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
Formal agreements can be used to achieve coordination among channel members. These agreements work by exerting explicit control over the members who make the agreements. However, implicit understandings can be used as a partial substitute for more formal agreements. In this paper, we show that implicit understandings can develop as channel members learn about each other's behavior.

## 6. Multiple Objective Linear Programming with Parametric Criteria Coefficients
### Author(s):
- Harold P. Benson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the multiple objective linear programming problem with parametric criteria coefficients. This problem is of interest since in many situations the coefficients of the objective functions of a multiple objective linear program either represent estimates of the true data or are subject to systematic variations. Properties of this problem are developed, and an algorithm for generating the set of all weakly-efficient extreme points of this problem is described. To implement this algorithm, a nonconvex subproblem must be solved for each candidate extreme point encountered. This is accomplished by applying the Generalized Benders Decomposition method. Computational results concerning the solution of these subproblems are presented.

## 7. The Best Order for Queues in Series
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
An important design problem for queueing systems is to determine the best order for two or more service stations in series. For given external arrival process and given service-time distributions, the object is to determine the order of the stations (to be used by all customers) that minimizes the expected equilibrium sojourn time per customer. Unfortunately, very little is known about this problem because exact analysis is extremely difficult. This paper applies approximation methods recently developed for networks of queues to obtain approximation formulas and useful heuristic design principles.

## 8. Fill-Rate Optimization in a One-Warehouse N-Identical Retailer Distribution System
### Author(s):
- Leroy B. Schwarz
- Bryan L. Deuermeyer
- Ralph D. Badinelli
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
This paper examines the system fill-rate of a one-warehouse N-identical retailer distribution system as a function of warehouse and retailer safety stock. Using the approximation model of Deuermeyer and Schwarz (Deuermeyer, B. L., L. B. Schwarz. 1981. A model for the analysis of system service level in warehouse/retailer distribution systems: the identical retailer case. Chapter 8 in Multi-Level Production/Inventory Control Systems: Theory and Practice. North-Holland, Amsterdam.) we examine the problem of maximizing system fill-rate subject to a constraint on system safety stock. Optimal safety stock policy is characterized to be the intersection of a fill-rate policy line and the safety stock budget line. Properties of fill-rate policy lines are given. These properties may be used to provide managerial insight into system optimization and as the basis for heuristics. One heuristic, the vertical heuristic, based on the corresponding deterministic version of the problem, yields trivially simple and near-optimal policies.

## 9. Optimal Ordering Policies Under Conditions of Extended Payment Privileges
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Davis
- Norman Gaither
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1985
### Abstract:
This paper develops optimal order quantities for firms that are offered a one-time opportunity to delay payment for an order of a commodity. Such delayed payments result in a reduction of the effective purchase cost, which is a function of the return available on alternative investments, the number of units of the commodity ordered, and the length of the extended period. Optimal order quantities are developed for extended payment privileges that occur at a reorder point of between reorder points. Six suppliers' extended payment scenarios are evaluated. A simulation analysis is conducted to determine the sensitivity of derived models to changes in the various input parameters. The simulation with realistic parameter values reveals that the additional discounted order quantity is insensitive to large changes in the ordering cost and unit price; sensitive to changes in the carrying cost and return rate of funds, but without significantly affecting the total cost; and extremely sensitive to the annual demand. Simple analytic decision rules are provided to guide firms that are offered such extended payment privileges.
