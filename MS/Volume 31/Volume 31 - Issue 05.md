### Abstract:
In most regions of the United States there is a serious imbalance between the number of kidneys donated for transplantation and the number of persons wishing to receive a transplant. This not only affects the quality of life of those unable to obtain a transplant, but it also has important repercussions on the large and rapidly growing federal expenditures for the treatment of end-stage renal disease by transplantation and dialysis. A simulation model was constructed to assess the impact that changes in the number of cadaveric kidneys donated in Michigan would have on the waiting list of potential kidney transplant recipients in the state. The model represents the process of matching donated kidneys to people on the waiting list, taking into account the compatibility of the donor with the potential recipient's blood type and the tissue compatibility of the recipient to the donor as estimated by cytotoxicity. We describe the structure and data needs of the model, and we discuss the results obtained for Michigan. It was found that, under the current conditions, the waiting list would continue to grow rapidly. The number of donors needed to compensate for this growth would have to be disproportionately large: as the number of donations increases the effect of each donation in reducing the waiting list is less. The approach is applicable to other regions and it should also be adaptable to other types of organ transplants that require tissue compatibility, once such transplants become common enough to warrant regional coordination of the matching of recipients with donors.

## 2. Should Scoring Rules be Effective?
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Nau
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
A scoring rule is a reward function for eliciting or evaluating forecasts expressed as discrete or continuous probability distributions. A rule is strictly proper if it encourages the forecaster to state his true subjective probabilities, and effective if it is associated with a metric on the set of probability distributions. Recently, the property of effectiveness (which is stronger than strict properness) has been proposed as a desideratum for scoring rules for continuous forecasts, for reasons of monotonicity in keeping the forecaster close to his true probabilities, since in practice the forecast must be chosen from a low-dimensional set of admissible distributions. It is shown in this paper that what effectiveness implies, beyond strict properness, is not a monotonicity property but a transitivity property, which is difficult to justify behaviorally. The logarithmic scoring rule is shown to violate the transitivity property, and hence is not effective. The L1 and L metrics are shown to allow no effective scoring rules. Some potential difficulties in interpreting admissible forecasts are also discussed.

## 3. Strategic Implications of Market Share Attraction Models
### Author(s):
- Aneel Karnani
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
Market share attraction models, which specify that a firm's market share is equal to the ratio of its attraction to the total attraction for all firms, have received increasing attention in recent years. However, there has been little research investigating the practical implications of such models. This paper presents a game-theoretic analysis of such a model and deduces the strategic implications of a Nash equilibrium solution to the model. It is shown that these implications are consistent with previous empirical research in marketing and business policy.

## 4. General Economic Equilibrium as a Unifying Concept in Energy-Economic Modeling
### Author(s):
- John P. Weyant
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
In the pristine model of general economic equilibrium producers and consumers are assumed to take prices for their inputs and outputs as given. A market equilibrium solution is obtained when the prices of all products lead to equal amounts of supply and demand for each. The mathematical properties of this model provide a rich and powerful unifying foundation for much of modern microeconomic theory. However, in many practical applications it is difficult or impossible to develop the data, and formulate and solve the equations required to implement the model of general economic equilibrium in its most general form. In practice, generality of formulation is often sacrificed for ease of computation and interpretation. These tradeoffs allow the latest breakthroughs in optimization algorithms and computer technology to be applied in the analysis of important societal problems.

## 5. The Tolerance Approach to Sensitivity Analysis in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Wendell
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
In constrast to ordinary sensitivity analysis in linear programming, the tolerance approach considers simultaneous and independent changes in the objective function coefficients and in the right-hand side terms. This approach yields a maximum tolerance percentage such that, as long as selected coefficients or terms are accurate to within that percentage of their estimated values, the same basis is optimal. In particular, if the objective function coefficients are accurate to within the maximum tolerance percentage of their specified values, then the same solution is optimal.

## 6. Estimating Network Characteristics in Stochastic Activity Networks
### Author(s):
- George S. Fishman
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
This paper describes a Monte Carlo method based on the theory of quasirandom points for estimating the distribution functions and means of network completion time and shortest path time in a stochastic activity network. In particular, the method leads to estimators whose absolute errors converge as (log K)N/K, where K denotes the number of replications collected in the experiment and N is the number of dimensions for sampling. This rate compares favorably with the standard error of estimate O(1/K1/2) which obtains for experiments that use random sampling. Moreover, since quasirandom points are nonrandom the upper bound (log K)N/K is deterministic in contrast to the random sampling rate O(1/K1/2) which is probabilistic. The paper demonstrates how the use of a cutset of the network reduces N in the bound when estimating the distribution functions. Two examples illustrate the benefits and costs of using quasirandom points.

## 8. Work Force Size and Single Shift Schedules with Variable Demands
### Author(s):
- R. N. Burns
- M. W. Carter
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
In recent years, labour negotiations for seven-day-week organizations such as hospitals, mining companies and chemical industries have seen an increased emphasis on improving shift schedules. This paper gives an exact lower bound on the number of workers required to satisfy such primary contractual commitments as ensuring that each employee receives at least A out of every B weekends off, everyone works exactly five days per week, and no one works more than six consecutive days. The model addressed is general in that it allows the number of workers required each day to vary. The proof that the bound is the best possible is constructive. A linear time algorithm is presented that generates schedules satisfying all the primary objectives. Extensions discuss means of incorporating secondary objectives such as giving pairs of adjacent days off.

## 9. Budgeting Costs of Nursing in a Hospital
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
This paper examines issues in building decision support models for budgeting nursing workforce requirements in a hospital. We determine regular-time, overtime, and agency workforce levels for various skill classes in a budget cycle. We introduce a family of eight models ranging from a single-period, aggregate and deterministic model to a multiperiod, disaggregate and probabilistic model. In a single-period model, we ignore the time-varying nature of demand for nursing hours. Aggregation is done over the nurse skill class mix. For probabilistic models, we consider demand uncertainty. Using empirical data, we evaluate the effects of level of sophistication in model building and in information requirements on their relative performances. The results suggest that ignoring the time-varying nature of demand does not induce gross errors in budget estimates. However, ignoring demand uncertainty produces underestimates (about five to six percent) of budget needsa consequence of a Madansky (Madansky, A. 1960. Inequalities for stochastic linear programming problem. Management Sci.6 197204.) inequality. It also induces added costs to the system due to implementing nonoptimal regular-time workforce levels. Finally, we find that a simple formula using a single-period demand estimate gives excellent approximations to the budget estimates obtainable from the more precise models.

## 10. An Analysis of Optimal Advertising Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Dung Nguyen
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
We examine the firm's optimal advertising behavior under conditions of uncertainty. For the static one-period model, we show that the firm's attitude toward risk may be responsible for the potential divergence between advertising decisions under uncertainty and those under deterministic conditions. For the dynamic multi-period model, the ultimate impact of uncertainty on advertising is further complicated when the sales response function contains an unknown parameter, and the firm wishes to gain more information about it through experimentation. We demonstrate that whether it is optimal for the firm to experiment at an advertising rate higher, equal to, or lower than the myopic (one-period) level would depend on the specification of the response function. Finally, we offer some empirical evidence for our assumption of a quadratic sales response function, using time-series data of twelve major brands of cigarettes.

## 11. NotePerformance Bounds for Lot Sizing Heuristics
### Author(s):
- Sven Axster
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the classical dynamic lot size problem without backlogging and capacity limitation. We derive worst case performance bounds for a class of lot sizing heuristics. When the considered methods are applied a decision whether to have a set-up or not in a certain period is taken without regarding the future demand. It is shown that 2 is a lower bound for the worst case performance ratio for such heuristics. The results illustrate circumstances under which the approximate techniques fail.

## 12. NoteA Note on the Optimality of the Modified Generalized Goal Decomposition Model
### Author(s):
- Wayne J. Davis
- David T. Whitford
### Published:
- 1 May 1985
### Abstract:
This note demonstrates that Freeland's (Freeland, J. R. 1976. A note on goal decomposition in a decentralized organization. Management Sci.23 100102.) modification of Ruefli's (Ruefli, T. W. 1971. A generalized goal decomposition model. Management Sci.17 505518.) Generalized Goal Decomposition model can generate nonoptimal solutions and shows how these difficulties can be corrected. In several papers on multi-level planning, it has been suggested that extending the hierarchical levels of the models from two to three or more levels is a straightforward process. This paper shows that this assertion is generally not true. The note points out that in Freeland's (Freeland, J. R. 1976. A note on goal decomposition in a decentralized organization. Management Sci.23 100102.) three-level model, the interactions between the two lowest level of the hierarchy must be strictly controlled before information is passed to the highest level of the organization.
