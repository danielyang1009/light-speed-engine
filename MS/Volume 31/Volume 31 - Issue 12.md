### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
We develop an optimization procedure for assisting decision-makers in the allocation of resources for cleaning up a specific oil spill. The objective function is to minimize a weighted combination of spill-specific response and damage costs. Inputs to this problem include information about the outflow of oil, availability and performance of spill cleanup equipment, as well as costs of equipment transported and on-scene operation. A general (albeit separable) damage function is assumed. The algorithm is deterministic and is based on a dynamic program within which a series of 0-1 knapsack problems are solved repeatedly. Although this algorithm is approximate, its worst-case performance is quantified and we argue that under realistic inputs the procedure can be expected to produce solutions very close to optimality. Under prescribed conditions we prove that the algorithm produces optimal solutions. A realistic example based on the Argo Merchant oil spill is presented to provide insight into the structure of this problem. Finally, we discuss possible uses of this model within the existing and alternative operational and policy environments.

## 2. On Combining Forecasts: Some Extensions and Results
### Author(s):
- Anthony E. Bopp
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
This paper is about the motivation, methodology, and evaluation of combining the forecasts from two or more different models in a combined forecast. Granger and Newbold (Granger, C., P. Newbold. 1977. Forecasting Economic Time Series. Academic Press, New York.) have presented this method as one whereby an optimal forecast can be obtained. Makridakis and Winkler (1966) and Winkler and Makridakis (Winkler, R., S. Makridakis. 1983. The combination of forecasts: some empirical results. J. Roy. Statist. Soc., Ser. A146 150157.) have presented results to support this claim and Mahmoud (Mahmoud, Essam. 1984. Accuracy in forecasting: a survey. J. Forecasting3 139159.) has reviewed over 20 articles all claiming that combined forecasts out perform single model forecasts. This paper extends this topic in a number of directions. First a section on motivation provides additional reasons for combining forecasts. Combination problems are then discussed in 2, observations and evaluations of the problem presented are discussed in 3 and concluding remarks are contained in 4.

## 3. Aggregating Subjective Forecasts: Some Empirical Results
### Author(s):

- Robert H. Ashton
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
The impact on forecast accuracy of aggregating the subjective forecasts of up to 13 individuals was examined for five forecast weighting methodsequal weighting, two ex post methods that took advantage of prior information about the individuals' relative accuracy, and two ex ante methods based on objective and subjective assessments of relative accuracy. The individuals were executives, managers and sales personnel employed by Time. Inc., and the variable forecasted was the number of advertising pages sold annually by Time magazine over a 14-year period. The results show that both the average forecast error and the variance of the error decrease as additional individuals' forecasts are included in the aggregate. Only two to five individuals' forecasts must be included to achieve much of the total improvement available from combining all 13 forecasts. Three of the differential weighting methods produced more accurate forecasts than equal weighting, but the magnitude of the improvement was small. Implications for realistic forecasting situations are discussed, as are conditions under which the use of aggregates seems attractive.

## 4. A Multiobjective Discrete Optimization Model for Land Allocation
### Author(s):
- Kenneth C. Gilbert
- David D. Holmes
- Richard E. Rosenthal
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
A multiobjective integer programming model is presented for allocating an area of land for development. The objectives considered in the allocation are cost, proximity to desirable and undesirable land features and the shape of the area. An interactive multiobjective optimization algorithm is presented and applied to the model. The algorithm generates a subset of efficient solutions with some guidance from the decision maker at each iteration as to what constitutes a preferred efficient point. The algorithm calls for the frequent solution of subproblems which constrain all but one of the objectives while optimizing the remaining one. In the land allocation model, the subproblems are integer programs solved efficiently by specialized enumeration techniques. For some of the subproblems (namely, those using proximity as the single objective), the first feasible solution we enumerate is guaranteed optimal. For the other subproblems, we show that an algorithm with this fortunate property would require the solution of an NP-hard problem at each step of the enumeration. The model and algorithm were tested in locating potential sites for a 13-acre residential development within a 2250-acre study area near Norris, Tennessee.

## 5. Optimal Capacity Expansion Over an Infinite Horizon
### Author(s):
- James C. Bean
- Robert L. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
The problem of choosing an optimal initial capacity expansion from a finite number of durable facility sizes is affected by potential future expansion decisions. As we consider such expansions over longer and longer study horizons, the optimal initial facility choice can fluctuate due to end-of-study effects. We discuss an algorithm that will determine, for arbitrary deterministic demand profiles, how long a horizon is sufficient to reach stability in the first facility choice. Moreover, it is shown that this first choice is the optimal first choice for the infinite horizon problem. We also establish an explicit analytical formula for a study horizon guaranteed to provide a first facility size that, followed by an infinite horizon expansion strategy, will attain a discounted cost within a predetermined maximal error of the optimal infinite horizon cost.

## 6. Branch and Bound Experiments in Convex Nonlinear Integer Programming
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
The branch and bound principle has long been established as an effective computational tool for solving mixed integer linear programming problems. This paper investigates the computational feasibility of branch and bound methods in solving convex nonlinear integer programming problems. The efficiency of a branch and bound method often depends on the rules used for selecting the branching variables and branching nodes. Among others, the concepts of pseudo-costs and estimations are implemented in selecting these parameters. Since the efficiency of the algorithm also depends on how fast an upper bound on the objective minimum is attained, heuristic rules are developed to locate an integer feasible solution to provide an upper bound. The different criteria for selecting branching variables, branching nodes, and heuristics form a total of 27 branch and bound strategies. These strategies are computationally tested and the empirical results are presented.

## 7. The Impact of Decision Models on Federal Coal Leasing
### Author(s):
- D. A. Gulley

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
A three-year case study was conducted of the effects of computer-based decision technology on policy formation, policy implementation, and routine operations in the Federal Coal Management Program. Several methodologies were used, including semistructured interviewing and content analysis. Midway through the interview schedule, program regulations were changed to reflect the different philosophies of the Carter and Reagan administrations, affording the observers an unusual opportunity to study the reactions of the organization to a de-emphasis on analyses and computer applications. Also noteworthy in the case was the emergence of a major public policy dispute which was closely associated with the coal leasing programs changes in use of computer-based economic analysis. We found that computer models had significant but not dominant effects on the workplace environment of most persons working in the program. Nevertheless some applications of computer models had very high visibility and large impacts.

## 8. A New Product Adoption Model with Price, Advertising, and Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Shlomo Kalish
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a framework for modeling innovation diffusion that includes price and advertising. The adoption of a new product is characterized by two steps: awareness and adoption. Awareness is the stage of being informed about the product search attributes. The process of becoming aware is modeled as a simple epidemic type model, where the information is spread by advertising and word of mouth. The second step, adoption, is conditional on awareness, and it occurs if the perceived risk adjusted value of the product exceeds its selling price. The population is heterogeneous with respect to valuation of the product. Individuals are risk averse, and therefore are willing to pay more for the product, on the average, as information from early adopters reduces uncertainty about the product. Optimal control of the diffusion process by pricing and advertising over time is analyzed, and a comparative estimation of the model in one application is reported.

## 9. NoteOpposition of Interest in Subjective Bayesian Theory
### Author(s):
- Joseph B. Kadane
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
A characterization is given of diametrically opposed interests between two players: either neither is a Bayesian, or both have a unique probability and utility function (up to the usual transformation) or both have many possible probabilities and utilities. In the second case, their utility functions must have representations that sum to zero, and they must have identical probability distributions on every uncertain event in the space. Implications of this result for negotiations and for game theory are discussed.

## 10. NoteA Note on the Use of the CAPM as a Strategic Planning Tool
### Author(s):
- Anthony E. Boardman
- Norman E. Carruthers
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
A recent paper by Naylor and Tapon (Naylor, Thomas H., Francis Tapon. 1982. The capital asset pricing model: an evaluation of its potential as a strategic planning tool. Management Sci.28 11661173.) showed that the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) can be an important strategic planning tool, but their specific strategic suggestions were incorrect. The proper conclusion to draw from the CAPM is that a company should purchase a business if its expected return exceeds the expected return in equilibrium of a business in the same risk class. In the absence of synergy, each potential acquisition should be evaluated on its own merit, independent of the other businesses in a company's portfolio. When all firms are in equilibrium, no gain may be made from merger or takeover.

## 11. NoteA Note on Computing Periodic Inspection Policies
### Author(s):
- Carl R. Schultz
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1985
### Abstract:
Certain systems must be inspected in order to discover failures that would otherwise go undetected. Periodic inspection is the most commonly used inspection policy and is the optimal policy form for some inspection models. Determining the optimal periodic inspection interval, however, would involve a numerical search and require knowledge of the underlying failure distribution. This note examines the cost performance of an existing simple approximation of the optimal inspection interval and presents a new approximation. The new approximation is computationally simple, and outperforms the existing approximation. The new approximation yields expected total costs that are typically well within one percent of optimal.
