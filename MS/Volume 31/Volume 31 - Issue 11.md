### Abstract:
A number of models have been developed in recent years for the allocation and deployment of urban police units. However, these models are not directly applicable to the state highway patrol counterparts. Although urban police and the state highway patrol are both law enforcement agencies, an urban police force typically operates by reacting to crimes already committed (i.e., a reactive mode of operation) while the state highway patrol attempts to maintain a visible presence to prevent infractions (i.e., a proactive mode of operation). This paper describes a modeling approach that can be used to deploy state highway patrol cars to the road segments comprising a highway patrol district. Specifically, an integer nonlinear goal programming model is described and demonstrated within the context of a hypothetical case example. The model reflects the fact that the relationships between unit deployment and performance measures are often nonlinearas additional patrol units are assigned to a road segment, performance will increase but at a decreasing rate. The model's goal constraints reflect the proactive nature of patrol deployment. The model is solved using a modified multi-criteria pattern/gradient search technique, and the results are analyzed to test their sensitivity to goal levels and priority structures.

## 2. An Experimental Evaluation of Graphical and Color-Enhanced Information Presentation

### Published:

### Abstract:
A laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the influence of graphical and color-enhanced information presentation on decision quality, decision-making time and user perceptions of information systems attributes. The experimental design examined the main and interaction effects of report format, color, and individual differences (field dependence/independence) among the subjects. The findings indicate that the claims made about the benefits of color-enhanced reports are subject to qualification. Even though color influenced decision-making quality in general, and to some extent color was more beneficial for graphical than tabular reports, its most significant impact was on the performance of field-dependents. The decision-making quality of field-dependents with color-enhanced reports was 73% better than field-dependents who did not have such reports. There were no performance differences between subjects who used tabular and graphical reports. This outcome is explained by taking into consideration the underlying nature of the task given to the subjects and how the reports were organized to support this task. This finding suggests that proponents of graphical presentation must qualify their claims to environments where there is a clearly defined rationale for the potential benefits of graphical report usage.

## 3. A Method of Multiattribute Decision Making with Incomplete Information
### Author(s):
- M. Weber
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
A precise determination of a multiattribute utility function of a decision maker or a group of decision makers requires considerable information that may not be available in many decision situations. In this paper the method HOPIE, which allows one to determine a set of utility functions consistent with the incomplete information received from the decision maker, is proposed. The method is based on holistic judgments of hypothetical alternatives defined by a certain factorial design. It requires that the evaluation of the alternatives be given on an interval scale. The method can also accommodate other types of additional information such as pairwise comparisons.

## 4. Information Acquisition and the Adoption of New Technology
### Author(s):
- Kevin F. McCardle
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
The profitability of a new technology is rarely known with certainty at its announcement date. Consequently, prior to making an adoption decision it behooves the firm considering the adoption of this innovation to reduce the level of uncertainty associated with its profitability. The firm accomplishes this by sequentially gathering information, updating its prior estimate of profitability in a Bayesian manner. Quantifying the uncertainty regarding the innovation permits application of dynamic programming techniques: criteria are derived which tell the firm when to stop collecting information and make the adoption decision. It will be shown that it is optimal for the firm to continue to collect information until its estimate of profitability crosses one of two thresholds: upon crossing the upper threshold the firm adopts the technology, whereas the firm rejects the technology if the lower threshold is crossed. The model predicts that even the manager who behaves optimally will occasionally adopt unprofitable technologies and reject profitable ones.

## 5. Beta in Linear Risk Tolerance Economies
### Author(s):
- Robert R. Grauer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
This paper employs numerical means to examine: (i) the expected return-beta plot in power utility Linear Risk Tolerance (LRT) economies, and (ii) whether, in the power utility economies, a valuation equation containing covariance and coskewness terms might better explain expected returns than one containing covariance terms alone. The results show that the expected return-beta plots constructed from real world return distributions are very similar to the plots found in empirical tests of the Mean Variance Capital Asset Pricing Model (MV CAPM). Hence a power utility LRT CAPM may provide a better theory of asset pricing than the MV CAPM does. While beta is not the correct measure of risk in power utility LRT economies, the results show that on average a valuation equation containing covariance terms only explains expected returns better than a valuation equation containing both covariance and coskewness terms.

## 6. Estimating Market Model Betas: A Comparison of Random Coefficient Methods and Their Ability to Correctly Identify Random Variation
### Author(s):
- Bill McDonald
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
When estimating market model betas using random coefficient methods, the rather fine distinction between significance or insignificance, as argued in recent studies, overlooks two important factors. First, the maximum likelihood method has not been tested in comparison to the generalized least squares approximation. Second, and more importantly, the ability of these methodologies to correctly identify a known random coefficient process has not been examined in the context of the market model. Using both simulations and subsequent empirical tests, this study shows that, for reasonable levels of variation in beta, neither method can consistently identify a random coefficient process. These results suggest that the nominal level of significant random coefficients previously observed could be indicative of a much more predominant phenomenon.

## 7. Scheduling to Minimize Maximum Workload
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
We pose the following problem: given m jobs, each of which requires a certain total amount of labour that must be performed within specified time periods, how should one schedule the jobs' execution to obtain a total workload that is as even as possible? A related question is: what is the minimal work capacity needed to accomplish all jobs? These questions can be formulated as a linear program, but the number of variables and constraints required usually will be large. Using linear duality theory we instead derive a purely combinatorial problem whose resolution leads to the needed minimal capacity, and thus to the imposed bottleneck. Then we concentrate on the important special case where the time constraints for performing each job are in the form of a single time interval: We detail a simple procedure that efficiently determines the minimal capacity and the bottleneck. A second efficient combinatorial algorithm determines a feasible execution schedule which minimizes the maximum total workload. These algorithms require a computational time of the order of m2 and negligible core memory, and for most practical applications can be implemented on microcomputers.

## 9. A Note on Competitive Bidding with Asymmetric Information
### Author(s):
- Rafael Rob
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
This note reexamines a problem of competitive bidding under asymmetrical information about the value of the object which was originally formulated and studied by R. Wilson (Wilson, R. B. 1967. Competitive bidding with asymmetric information. Management Sci.13 816820.). We analyze the Stackelberg equilibria of the game under alternative behavioral assumptions about the sequencing of moves. The relative gains of the seller and the two buyers are computed for specific numerical examples.

## 10. On the Replenishment of Repair Kit Inventories for Systems with Life Distributions of Phase Type
### Author(s):
- Charles E. Wells
- John L. Bryant
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
Several models are developed for the evaluation of replenishment policies for an inventory of repair kits used by a system subject to both repairable and nonrepairable failures. At the time of a repairable failure, a repair kit is removed from inventory and used to renew the system. Nonrepairable failures are assumed to occur at some time in the future distributed as a random variable of phase type and permanently terminate the life of the system. Under general stochastic assumptions concerning the lifetime of the components and the time required to perform repair, reorder strategies are identified which maximize the expected net discounted contribution over the lifetime of the systems.

## 11. A State Space Modeling Approach for Time Series Forecasting
### Author(s):
- Tep Sastri
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1985
### Abstract:
A stochastic filtering method is presented for on-line recursive estimation and forecasting of autocorrelated time series. Several state space models for nonseasonal and seasonal time series, which belong to the autoregressive integrated-moving average class, are presented. The Kalman filter is introduced as the recursive data processor for on-line time series forecasting. The estimation problem and initial values determination are discussed, and numerical examples are given. An extension of Brown's adaptive smoothing method for autocorrelated time series through the proposed filtering approach is also presented.
