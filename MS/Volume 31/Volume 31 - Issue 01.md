## 1. A Measurement Error Approach for Modeling Consumer Risk Preference
### Author(s):
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
- John R. Hauser
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Von Neumann-Morgenstern (vN-M) utility theory is the dominant theoretical model of risk preference. Recently, market researchers have adapted vN-M theory to model consumer risk preference. But, most applications assess utility functions by asking just n questions to specify n parameters. However, any questioning format, especially under market research conditions, introduces measurement error. This paper explores the implications of measurement error on the estimation of the unknown parameters in vN-M utility functions and provides procedures to deal with measurement error.

## 2. Ordinal Ranking with Intensity of Preference
### Author(s):
- Wade D. Cook
- Moshe Kress
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
In conventional ordinal ranking models the voter/ranker supplies an ordered set of preferences on a collection of objects without specifying any form of intensity of preference. For example, an executive committee of ten members is required to assign five candidates to five positions. The nature of the positions is such that position one requires the highest qualified candidate (relative to a given attribute), position two the second qualified person and so on.

## 3. A Cluster-Analytic Approach to Facility Layout
### Author(s):
- Michael Scriabin
- Roger C. Vergin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Due to the combinatorial nature of the facility layout problem, current heuristic computer procedures do not always provide better solutions than visual methods. A new algorithm, FLAC (Facility Layout by Analysis of Clusters), is described which emulates the visual methods used by industrial engineers in solving facility layout problems. Initially side-stepping the combinatorial nature of the problem, FLAC is found to perform well in problems with high as well as low flow dominance, and in the presence and absence of line dominance. Computation time is attractive, especially on larger problems.

## 4. Malaysian Integrated Population Program Performance: Its Relation to Organizational and Integration Factors
### Author(s):
- C. O. Fong
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
The aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, it seeks to compare the efficacy of the Malaysian integrated population (i.e., integration of family planning with health) program with its categorial family planning counterpart. Secondly, it attempts to identify the organizational factors and the integration factors (operationalized as staff integrative linkages) that result in better program performance for the two programs. On the basis of effectiveness of family planning diffusion, the results of the analysis indicate that the Malaysian integrated population program is more effective than its categorial counterpart. Further, integrative linkage variables were found to be an important group of variables that results in the improved effectiveness of the integrated program. This suggests that future expansion of the Malaysian population program (and population programs of other developing countries in a similar stage of development as Malaysia) should be through the approach of integrating family planning services with the health network, rather than through the expansion of the categorial family planning organization.

## 5. Antithetic Variates, Multivariate Dependence and Simulation of Stochastic Systems
### Author(s):
- Reuven Y. Rubinstein
- Gennady Samorodnitsky
- Moshe Shaked
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Some theoretical and practical aspects antithetic and common random numbers for variance reduction in simulation of stochastic systems with dependent elements are considered. A proof of their optimality in estimating the expected value of the response sum or the response difference of a pair of functions of vector arguments with dependent components is presented. The efficiency of antithetic and common random numbers for variance reduction under different assumptions for the response functions is discussed. Applications to reliability, networks and queueing systems are given.

## 6. Reversibility of Tandem Blocking Queueing Systems
### Author(s):
- Genji Yamazaki
- Takeshi Kawashima
- Hirotaka Sakasegawa
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with queueing systems of several service stations in series in which each station may consist of multi-servers. An infinite number of customers always waits in front of the first station, and each customer passes through all of the stations in sequence. There is only a finite number of waiting positions between any two adjacent stations. The service time for a customer at any station is assumed to be a random variable, the distribution of which may depend on the station. In this mode of operation the servers at any station will at any time be busy, idle, or blocked. This blocking system is said to be C-reversible if the capacity remains invariant under reversal of the system. The reversed system is obtained by reversing the original stations' order, that is, every customer in the reversed system passes through the original stations in the reverse order. It has already been proved that C-reversibility holds for any blocking system in which each station consists of either a single server of nondeterministic service times or multi-servers of deterministic service times, and that the blocking system has a stronger property than C-reversibility.

## 7. The p-Median Problem for Cluster Analysis: A Comparative Test Using the Mixture Model Approach
### Author(s):
- T. D. Klastorin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Recently, Mulvey and Crowder (Mulvey, J., H. Crowder. 1979. Cluster analysis: an application of Lagrangian relaxation. Management Sci.25 329340.) suggested that the p-median problem might be useful for cluster analysis problems (where the goal is to group objects described by a vector of characteristics in such a way that objects in the same group are somehow more alike than objects in different groups). The intent of this paper is to test Mulvey and Crowder's proposal using the mixture model approach; i.e., by applying a number of algorithms (including one for the p-median problem) to a set of objects randomly sampled from a number of known multivariate populations and comparing the ability of each algorithm to detect the original populations. In order to evaluate the results, a generalized partition comparison measure and its distribution are developed. Using this measure, results from various algorithms are compared.

## 8. Use of Sample Information in Stochastic Recourse and Chance-Constrained Programming Models
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
In probabilistic linear programming models the decision maker is typically assumed to know the probability distribution of the random parameters. Here it is assumed that the distribution functions of the parameters have a specified functional form F(t, ), where  is an unknown (real) vector parameter. We suppose that the decision maker has the opportunity of observing a random sample drawn from F(t, ). For a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model the deterministic equivalent model is found using a Bayesian approach. Properties are presented for the deterministic equivalents in general and in the special case of the simple recourse model. Expressions for Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI) and Expected Net Gain from Sampling (ENGS) are also derived. In the final section similar results are obtained for chance constrained programming models.

## 9. NoteThe Logic of Policy as Argument
### Author(s):
- Mitchell O. Locks
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
This paper is a review and evaluation of a policy argument in a recent issue of Management Science. Mitroff, Mason and Barabba presented a case study of a policy model, built around the problem of undercounting minorities in the U.S. Census, in a Toulmin format. We restructure this model as a Boolean system with both conditional and unconditional statements, preserving both the MMB arguments and the Toulmin format. It is shown that there is an error in the buildup of the MMB model. This error does not change the end result that their model is a contradiction, however it is much earlier to see this fact with the Boolean formulation than with a verbal presentation only. We discuss the potential usefulness of this type of modelling for policy capture, including some of the difficulties of employing the Toulmin format.

## 10. NoteTesting Regret
### Author(s):
- Paul Anand
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Bell's recent paper (Bell, D. E. 1983. Risk premiums for decision regret. Management Sci.29 11561166.) in this journal provides useful foundations for the regret approach to decision theory. This work is all the more important because regret, that is, the pain of having chosen incorrectly, is one of the few radical departures from the conceptual framework of the ubiquitous expected utility model and its variants. Despite providing many of the parametric accoutrements deemed necessary for the acceptance of a model he has not, I believe, proposed a test which is the most appropriate to establish the validity of regret.

## 11. ReplyPutting a Premium on Regret
### Author(s):
- David E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1985
### Abstract:
Anand (Anand, P. 1985. Testing regret. Management Sci.31 114116.) has suggested that measuring the sacrifice a person is prepared to make to avoid regret may be more difficult than I suggest in Bell (Bell, D. E. 1983. Risk premiums for decision regret. Management Sci.29 11561166.). Though he believes regret is probably widespread, he is concerned that regret may be confounded with other of the psychological phenomena that I have discussed, especially disappointment (Bell [Bell, D. E. 1985. Disappointment in decision making under uncertainty. Harvard Business School Working Paper 83-18, 1982. Oper. Res. (January--February).]). I will use this opportunity for response to set my work in perspective.
