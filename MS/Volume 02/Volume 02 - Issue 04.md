## 1. Operations Engineering
### Author(s):
- E. R. Bowerman
- S. B. Littauer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
Interest in management science, especially under the name “operations research,” on the part of industry has grown since World War II due partly to the publicity given to military applications and partly to the return to industry of men trained along these lines. The techniques have become more fully developed and it is the purpose of this article to develop some conclusions we have been able to draw from our experience in applying the concepts. These conclusions resulted from an analysis of what was needed to apply operations research techniques to manufacturing. In particular, attention was given to stabilizing procedures, to making decisions in the face of uncertainty and to improving communication. It was found that these and related operating problems could be handled in an engineering fashion so that operations research would be more effective.

## 2. Some Models of Inventory and an Application
### Author(s):
- Eliezer Naddor
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with two topics: (1) the development of mathematical models for several simple inventory situations, and (2) an industrial application of a mathematical model of inventory. Because T. M. Whitin has described in detail in this journal the present state of research in inventory control (Whitin, T. M. 1954. Inventory control research. Management Sci.I (November).), no attempt will be made to provide a review here. This paper is not an attempt to solve the “general inventory problem.” On the contrary, the object is to deal with specific situations, and with an illustrative industrial application. The emphasis is on methodology of approach rather than on a general solution.

## 3. A Fruitful Application of Static Marginal Analysis
### Author(s):
- H. W. Karr
- M. A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
This paper describes the application of the technique of simple “marginal analysis” to an Air Force problem and suggests that a similar application may be useful in many industrial situations. Examples of such industrial problems are also presented.

## 4. A Mathematical Model for Integrated Business Systems
### Author(s):
- Irving J. Lieberman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
The business firm is not merely “facts”, modified by logic, engineering, and intuition forming communication networks among rational individuals with perdictable reactions. Nevertheless, it is true that intercommunication of facts is necessary for continuance and that the prosperity of the firm does depend to a significant degree on the efficiency, effectiveness, and application of facts toward operations throughout the enterprise. The form and manner of data transmittal must be prescribed and organized. It is to this portion of the problems of management that the considerations in this paper are directed.

## 5. An Optimum Geographical Distribution of Publicity Expenditure in a Private Organisation
### Author(s):
- A. P. Zentler
- Dorothy Ryde
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
This paper attempts the solution of a practical problem. Given an international organisation with branches in n different countries and concerned with publicity for a commodity X—in competition with a substitute X′—how should such an organisation allocate its expenditure among them so as to get the maximum overall return. Though our model is necessarily based to some extent on intelligent guess-work, it has the merit of providing at least a logically consistent solution of the problem.

## 6. Geographical Distribution of Production in Multiple Plant Operations
### Author(s):
- John D. Dillon
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1956
### Abstract:
The primary purpose of this report is to point up the interrelations found among selected conflicting company objectives, the criteria by which one may evaluate alternate course of action indicated by each of the stated objectives, and some methods for reducing similar problems to a reasonable size, susceptible of analysis by available mathematical techniques. The problem discussed herein is a real problem, but in order to protect the interests of the company which sponsored this particular study, the entire report is paraphrased, and numbers such as quantities and dollars are deliberately changed.
