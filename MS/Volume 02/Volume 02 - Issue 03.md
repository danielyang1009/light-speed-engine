## 1. General Systems Theory—The Skeleton of Science
### Author(s):
- Kenneth E. Boulding
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
In recent years increasing need has been felt for a body of systematic theoretical constructs which will discuss the general relationships of the empirical world. This is the quest of General Systems Theory. It does not seek, of course, to establish a single, self-contained “general theory of practically everything” which will replace all the special theories of particular disciplines. Such a theory would be almost without content, for we always pay for generality by sacrificing content, and all we can say about practically everything is almost nothing. Somewhere however between the specific that has no meaning and the general that has no content there must be, for each purpose and at each level of abstraction, an optimum degree of generality. It is the contention of the General Systems Theorists that this optimum degree of generality in theory is not always reached by the particular sciences.

## 2. Present Status of the Work of Managing
### Author(s):
- Harold F. Smiddy
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
I am going to take advantage of my brief time with you here to see if we can establish the basic meaning of a Science of Management; and so to reveal the intent which has guided the steps of many who have chosen to search through the complex of social, political and economic variables which both describe the direction in which understanding may be found and inhibit the progress toward it.

## 3. Management Science in Marketing: Status and Prospects
### Author(s):
- Melvin Anshen
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
The practice of administration in marketing has been handicapped by a type of cultural lag. In every phase of marketing operations the application of systematic methodology to the management task has trailed by approximately one generation the experience in the field of production. Recognition of the causes of this lag helps to explain the current state of management science in marketing and will contribute to an understanding of future prospects and opportunities. This understanding has relevance for advances in the science and its application, on one hand, and in management's willingness and ability to use a scientific approach to making marketing decisions, on the other.

## 4. A Problem in Optimal Machine Loading
### Author(s):
- M. E. Salveson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
An important managerial problem in manufacturing is to determine the optimum amount and mix of products that can be manufactured from a given set of facilities, such as machine tools. A method is discussed here for handling this problem more effectively in one instance than has been possible. It makes use of several standard procedures, but adapts them and adds others to accommodate the unavoidable difficulty of discreteness in real production situations. The traditional formulation of the economic lot size is shown to be incorrect in the general case and a preferred formulation is presented for the situation studied here. A method of optimizing the amount of in-process inventory to carry in the circumstances of this study also is given.

## 5. A Computing Procedure for a Line Balancing Problem
### Author(s):
- James R. Jackson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
In a recent article (Salveson, M. E. 1955. The assembly line balancing problem. J. Indust. Engrg.VI 18–25.), M. E. Salveson discussed various problems concerned with setting up production lines. The purpose of the present paper is to set forth an enumeration procedure for solving one of these problems. The reader is referred to Salveson's article for a detailed discussion of the circumstances in which this problem arises and for remarks concerning the assumptions in its statement.

## 6. On the Theory of Dynamic Programming—A Warehousing Problem
### Author(s):
- Richard Bellman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
In a recent report, [Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper. Generalizations of the warehousing model. O. N. R. Research Memorandum, No. 34, 1955, Graduate School of Industrial Administration, Carnegie Institute of Technology.], Charnes and Cooper present a solution by means of linear programming techniques of one version of what is called the “warehouse problem”. The purpose of this note is to indicate how problems of this general nature may be approached by means of the functional equation technique of the theory of dynamic programming, and thereby reduced to a very simple and straight-forward computational problem.

## 7. The Transhipment Problem
### Author(s):
- Alex Orden
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1956
### Abstract:
The transportation problem has offered two mathematical facets: (1) as a specialized type of linear programming problem, (2) as a method of representation of some combinatorial problems. In this paper a third aspect of the mathematical properties of the transportation problem is developed. It is shown that the same mathematical framework can be extended beyond pair-wise connections, to the determination of optimum linked paths over a series of points. This extension although viewed here as a linear programming problem, takes advantage of the combinatorial aspect of the transportation problem, and applications may arise which, like the assignment problem, appear to be combinatorial problems, but which can be solved by linear programming.
