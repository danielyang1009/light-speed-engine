## 1. Computers as Tools for Management
### Author(s):
- John S. Coleman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
This year the development of electronic digital computing machines has reached the point where American industry can turn from analysis and speculation to actual trial of the effectiveness of these machines in general business use. In these circumstances, it would seem necessary to look to the fundamentals right now, early in the growth period. Most of the business applications of computers, which we have planned up to this point, have led in one direction: greater speed in the processing of business data. To achieve this goal, we have aimed at more and more complete office automation. Probably that was a sound choice of a starting point. For business became interested in the electronic computer when it was pointed out that the machine can effect great savings in the processing of data. Hence this application of the computer was the foot in the door needed to get this industry off to a sound start financially.

## 2. Formulating a Theory of Work Measurement
### Author(s):
- Adam Abruzzi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
Most everyone would agree that optimal management decisions can only be made on the basis of sharp information. However, this question has not received much specific attention in the literature, largely because of a preoccupation with formal theories and models. This is quite understandable for, until comparatively recently, there was little theory in the field of management science. This is no longer the case, and the theories have far outrun data-gathering procedures. Indeed, the theories themselves suggest that better data-gathering procedures are needed than have heretofore been available. Improved theories and models simply demand improved sources and types of data.

## 3. Recent Advances in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
As interest grows rapidly in industry on the potentialities of mathematical programming techniques, it appears worthwhile to have a paper devoted to some of the more promising developments which may speed up the transition from interest to use. Three topics have been selected (in three sections that follow) which have recently come into prominence: uncertainty, combinatorial problems, and large scale systems. The reader will find in the course of their discussions that a survey—though perhaps not a systematic survey—has been made of current techniques in the linear programming field.

## 4. An Inventory Policy for a Case of Lagged Delivery
### Author(s):
- M. Beckman
- R. Muth
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the question which inventory policy is optimal in the presence of long delivery lags under otherwise simple conditions. The data on which the solution depends are the average demand per day (say), the carrying cost per unit and day, the fixed and per unit costs of ordering, the penalty per day of shortage, and the delivery lag. It will be shown that under certain conditions, mentioned presently, the optimal inventory policy is of the following simple type: order a fixed amount whenever the level of stock plus outstanding orders reaches a certain level. Formulas for the determination of the order size and of the reordering point will be derived.

## 5. Current Status of the Industrial Use of Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- L. Wheaton Smith, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
The 1955 Conference on Business Statistics (Held in Philadelphia, June 9 and 10, 1955, sponsored by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and by the American Statistical Association. The panel on linear programming was organised by M. M. Flood.) included a two-day panel discussion on “The Current Uses of Linear Programming in American Business.” The participants in the panel represented a wide enough segment of those who have been active in linear programming to permit brief coverage of a major portion of the active applications. Consequently, this report attempts to summarize the “state of the art” on the basis of that conference (The report is based in part on a verbal summary at the close of the panel discussions by a committee which consisted of A. Orden, L. Wheaton Smith, Jr., and H. H. Cauvet.).

## 6. Derivation of a Linear Decision Rule for Production and Employment
### Author(s):
- Charles C. Holt
- Franco Modigliani
- John F. Muth
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
An application of linear decision rules to production and employment scheduling was described in the last issue of this journal [Holt, C. C., F. Modigliani, H. A. Simon. 1955. A linear decision rule for production and employment scheduling. Management Sci. (October).]. The hypothetical performance of these rules represented a significant improvement over the actual company performance as measured by independent cost estimates and other managerial measures of efficiency. The quadratic cost function which was used should be applicable to production and employment scheduling decisions in many other situations. Also the general approach of approximating decision criteria with quadratic functions and obtaining linear decision rules can usefully be extended to many decision problems.

## 7. The Objectives of TIMS
### Author(s):
- Merrill M. Flood
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
Article II of the Constitution of The Institute of Management Sciences provides that: “The objects of The Institute shall be to identify, extend, and unify scientific knowledge that contributes to the understanding and practice of management.” This evening, I shall offer a few personal views and convictions concerning possible paths through the future to these goals.

## 8. Management Science—Fact or Theory?
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1956
### Abstract:
Theory and fact are just two sides of the same coin; but the two sides of a coin are different, and this difference will continue to characterize the development of management science. I hope that the future issues of the journal will more and more emphasize the problems of measurement and data-determination, just as they have emphasized “theoretical” formulations in the past.
