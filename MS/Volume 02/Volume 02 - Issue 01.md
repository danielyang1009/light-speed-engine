## 1. A Linear Decision Rule for Production and Employment Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Charles C. Holt
- Franco Modigliani
- Herbert A. Simon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
The decision problems involved in setting the aggregate production rate of a factory and setting the size of its work force are frequently both complex and difficult. The quality of these decisions can be of great importance to the profitability of an individual company, and when viewed on a national scale these decisions have a significant influence on the efficiency of the economy as a whole. This paper reports some of the findings of a research team that has been developing new methods to enable production executives to make better decisions and to make them more easily than they can with prevailing procedures. With the cooperation of a manufacturing concern, the new methods have been developed in the context of a set of concrete production scheduling problems that were found in a factory operated by the company.

### Abstract:
The success of any industrial enterprise is obviously dependent upon the effectiveness of its managerial organization and its supervisory personnel. There are differences in management in different industries and even within the same industry in a single country. And these managerial differences may be the single most important competitive difference. But, the differences may be even greater and more significant when comparisons are made on a cross-national basis. In Europe, for example, the concept of the function of management is quite different from that in the United States, as are the variances in the avenues of access to managerial positions.

## 3. The Uses of Game Theory in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
Since the war, there has been a great growth in interest in the theory of organization. The size of many modern organizations has brought to the surface problems of communication and decision-making of a very different nature to those confronted by smaller groups. A large organization appears to be both quantitatively and qualitatively different from a small one. Information flows and decisions that could be comfortably handled by one “jack-of-all-trades” executive in a small organization or in a dictatorial system, where wastage may be no problem, must be broken down and handled by many specialists. In many cases they may never reach the one-man decision level but are finally acted upon by groups. The need to understand these vital processes of decision-making has impelled us to lay emphasis upon the gathering and study of information, the evaluation of goals, and the role of the individual decision-maker.

## 4. Automatic Management: A Forecast and its Educational Implications
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
These remarks are intended to outline a forecast of the future of management and management science, namely that through scientific research management is going to become increasingly automatic. This forecast is based on a survey and projection of some contemporary technological and scientific developments.

## 5. Inventory Control and Price Theory
### Author(s):
- T. M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
In spite of the high level of interest in inventory control that has sprung up recently among statisticians, economists, and businessmen, very little has been written that indicates the fundamental connection between price theory and inventory control. Most of the inventory control systems now in operation assume a given price structure. The analysis is frequently restricted to cost minimization. Economic theorists, on the other hand,~have concerned themselves with profit maximization but have not ordinarily concerned themselves with the realistic details underlying the construction of their curves. Only in the event that other variables external to the cost minimization problem are assigned optimal values will the cost minimization problem be equivalent to profit maximization.

## 6. A Basis for Strategic Decisions on Inventory Control Operations
### Author(s):
- George J. Feeney
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
It is the purpose of this paper to suggest that inventory control operations involve two distinct types of problems which may be identified as tactical decision problems and strategic decision problems. The difference between these two types of problems will be discussed in more detail below. For the moment it is sufficient to observe that a solution to the tactical problem defines a family of decision rules while a solution to the strategic problem involves a final selection of some particular member of this family. It will be suggested, further, that while much attention has been given to the tactical decision problem, the methods typically employed to solve the strategic problem are frequently less than satisfactory. Finally, an alternative approach to strategic decisions on inventory control operations will be outlined. This alternative approach will be illustrated through two specific examples taken from recent experience.

## 7. On the Optimal Inventory Equation
### Author(s):
- R. Bellman
- I. Glicksberg
- O. Gross
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1955
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to discuss a number of functional equations which arise in the “optimal inventory” problem. This is a particular case of the general problem of ordering in the face of an uncertain future demand. Actually, an important aspect of the problem is that of determining a suitable criterion of cost, one which is both realistic and analytically malleable.
