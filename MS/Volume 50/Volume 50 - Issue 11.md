## 1. 50th Anniversary Article: Organizational Behavior, Strategy, Performance, and Design in Management Science
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
This article provides a personal perspective on the themes and topics that have emerged in research published by the department of organizational behavior, in the first 50 years of Management Science. A review of articles accepted by the department suggests several themes that reflect broad objectives, such as “improving management science models,” or distinguishing points of view or assumptions, such as “treating organizations as decision-making entities.” The research is summarized through topics and subtopics that classify the subjects and findings of the research, identifying the relative popularity of the topics, and their contribution to each of the themes. The pattern suggests that as a “behavioral” department in a journal characterized by managerial practice, optimization, and the context of real work organizations, research is uniquely grounded in applications, solutions, and work consequences in ways that are less prevalent in typical outlets for behavioral research. The article concludes by suggesting that there are ample signs of convergence across departments in the journal. Scholars in organizational behavior increasingly recognize that the context provided by other management disciplines provides essential insights. Likewise, scholars in other management disciplines increasingly recognize the value of integrating behavioral theories and findings into their frameworks and models.

## 2. The Strength of Weak Ties You Can Trust: The Mediating Role of Trust in Effective Knowledge Transfer
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
Research has demonstrated that relationships are critical to knowledge creation and transfer, yet findings have been mixed regarding the importance of relational and structural characteristics of social capital for the receipt of tacit and explicit knowledge. We propose and test a model of two-party (dyadic) knowledge exchange, with strong support in each of the three companies surveyed. First, the link between strong ties and receipt of useful knowledge (as reported by the knowledge seeker) was mediated by competence- and benevolence-based trust. Second, once we controlled for these two trustworthiness dimensions, the structural benefit of weak ties emerged. This finding is consistent with prior research suggesting that weak ties provide access to nonredundant information. Third, competence-based trust was especially important for the receipt of tacit knowledge. We discuss implications for theory and practice.

## 3. Managing Knowledge in the Dark: An Empirical Study of the Reliability of Capability Evaluations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
If knowledge is to be managed and transferred, it is essential that members of organizations know and agree on where capabilities reside. Few studies, however, have examined the difficulties of evaluating capabilities in large firms. This paper reports an in-depth empirical study of capabilities central to knowledge management efforts in large leading multinational companies. The results show that evaluation of these capabilities is a complex task. The median interrater correlation for capabilities designated as strategic by top management is only 0.28. Analysis of the determinants of reliability show that the difference in evaluations is largest for subsidiaries managers know less about, for younger subsidiaries, and for subsidiaries in less important markets. The results of our empirical study have important implications for creating, retaining, and transferring knowledge in organizations.

## 4. Managing Knowledge-Based Resource Capabilities Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
A firm's ability to manage its knowledge-based resource capabilities has become increasingly important as a result of performance threats triggered by technology change and intense competition. At the manufacturing plant level, we focus on three repositories of knowledge that drive performance. First, the physical production or information systems represent knowledge embedded in the plant's technical systems. Second, the plant's workforce has knowledge, including diverse scientific information and skills, to effectively operate the technical systems. Third, the firm's managerial systems embody knowledge in the form of goals, reward systems, and control and coordination systems. Taken together, we consider the technical systems, workforce knowledge, and the managerial systems as the plant's knowledge-based resource capability.

## 5. Knowledge and Performance in Knowledge-Worker Teams: A Longitudinal Study of Transactive Memory Systems
### Author(s):
- Kyle Lewis
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
This study examined how transactive memory systems (TMSs) emerge and develop to affect the performance of knowledge-worker teams. Sixty-four MBA consulting teams (261 members) participated in the study. I proposed that the role and function of TMSs change to meet different task and knowledge demands during a project. Hypotheses predicting that TMSs emerge during a project-planning phase as a function of a team's initial conditions, and later develop and mature as a function of the nature and frequency of communication were generally supported, as were hypothesized relationships between TMSs and team performance and viability. Findings suggest that teams with initially distributed expertise and familiar members are more likely to develop a TMS. Frequent face-to-face communication also led to TMS emergence, but communication via other means had no effect. Teams with more established TMSs later benefited from face-to-face communication, but they were less helped by frequent communication via other means, suggesting that transactive retrieval processes may have been triggered during face-to-face communication and suppressed during other types of communication. TMSs were positively related to team viability and team performance, suggesting that developing a TMS is critical to the effectiveness of knowledge-worker teams.

## 6. Effects of Adaptive Behaviors and Shared Mental Models on Control Crew Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
Control crews are highly trained teams responsible for monitoring complex systems, performing routine procedures, and quickly responding to nonroutine situations. Previous literature suggests that higher-performing control crews engage in adaptive behavior during high-workload or crisis situations. Other work suggests that higher-performing crews use periods of lower workloads to prepare for future problems. To understand which behaviors performed during which situations better differentiate lower- from higher-performing crews, we conducted a study of 14 nuclear power plant control room crews and examined adaptive behaviors and shared mental model development in the crews as they faced monitoring, routine, and nonroutine situations. Our results suggest that few differences in adaptive behaviors exist between higher- and lower-performing crews during monitoring or routine situations, but that information collection and shared mental model development activities, and intracrew processes used during model development, differ significantly between lower- and higher-performing control crews during nonroutine situations.

## 7. The Role of Volition in Organizational Learning: The Case of Automotive Product Recalls
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
What is the role of volition in organizational learning? Do firms learn better in response to internal procedures or external mandates? Existing literature provides conflicting answers to this question, with some theories suggesting that volition is important for learning because autonomy increases commitment and problem analyses, whereas external mandates tend to produce defensive reactions that are not coupled to the organization in any useful way. Yet, other theories suggest that mandate is important for learning because external pressures act as jolts that help overcome organizational inertia, resulting in deep exploration of problems to prevent future surprises. We investigate this issue in the context of automakers learning from voluntary versus involuntary product recalls. Using data on all recalls experienced by automakers that sold passenger cars in the United States during the 1966–1999 period, we follow the learning-curve tradition in investigating the effects of voluntary and involuntary recalls on subsequent recall rates. We find that voluntary recalls result in more learning than mandated recalls when learning is measured as a reduction in subsequent involuntary recalls. This effect is at least partly because of shallower learning processes that result from involuntary recalls. The effect of volition, however, is different for generalist and specialist automakers. The results of this study suggest an important, yet understudied, determinant of the rate and effectiveness of learning—volition. The results also add to our knowledge of the different learning processes of generalist and specialist organizations.

## 8. Focusing Firm Evolution: The Impact of Information Infrastructure on Market Entry by U.S. Telecommunications Companies, 1984–1998
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
Organization structure acts as a lens on the environment, gathering information and shaping its flow through a firm to inform managers' choices. This shaping of information flow happens through an organization's operating units, which selectively process information from the environment, and through the links between them, which pass information between units. We explore the relationship between this “information infrastructure” and firm strategy using structure and service information from the eight largest telephone service providers in the United States from 1984 to 1998. We find that firms with more units that scan areas of opportunity are more likely to enter a market, while firms with more units that scan nonfocal areas are less likely to enter the market. We also find that personnel links between units and the corporate level of the firm often constrain entry to new markets by dampening a unit's appetite for risk. Personnel links between operating units, on the other hand, can make a firm more likely to enter new markets, particularly when the cooperating units combine different sets of information. Thus, a firm's information infrastructure plays a dual role in shaping firm evolution, leading toward some paths and away from others.

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
This study asserted that quality improvement (QI) requires the coexistence of two cultural values of innovation and attention to detail and proposed that their coexistence depends on the implementation of multiple QI practices. A longitudinal QI intervention, with five phases, consisting of multiple QI practices—ISO 9000, QI teams, quality goals, and coaching and communication by top management—was implemented.

## 10. How Effective Are Electronic Reputation Mechanisms? An Experimental Investigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
Electronic reputation or “feedback” mechanisms aim to mitigate the moral hazard problems associated with exchange among strangers by providing the type of information available in more traditional close-knit groups, where members are frequently involved in one another's dealings. In this paper, we compare trading in a market with online feedback (as implemented by many Internet markets) to a market without feedback, as well as to a market in which the same people interact with one another repeatedly (partners market). We find that while the feedback mechanism induces quite a substantial improvement in transaction efficiency, it also exhibits a kind of public goods problem in that, unlike in the partners market, the benefits of trust and trustworthy behavior go to the whole community and are not completely internalized. We discuss the implications of this perspective for improving feedback systems.

## 11. Remembrance of Things Past? The Dynamics of Organizational Forgetting
### Author(s):
- Pablo Martin de Holan
- Nelson Phillips
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2004
### Abstract:
How organizations create, transfer, and retain knowledge has been the focus of intensive investigation by management researchers. However, one aspect of the dynamics of knowledge—organizational forgetting—has received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we draw on an exploratory, multiple-case study of learning in international strategic alliances to explore how and why organizations forget. Based on our case study, we develop a theory of organizational forgetting, discuss the role of forgetting in the dynamics of organizational knowledge, and present a typology of types of organizational forgetting.
