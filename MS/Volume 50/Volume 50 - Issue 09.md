## 3. Option Pricing Under a Double Exponential Jump Diffusion Model
### Author(s):
- S. G. Kou

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
Analytical tractability is one of the challenges faced by many alternative models that try to generalize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to incorporate more empirical features. The aim of this paper is to extend the analytical tractability of the Black-Scholes model to alternative models with jumps. We demonstrate that a double exponential jump diffusion model can lead to an analytic approximation for finite-horizon American options (by extending the Barone-Adesi and Whaley method) and analytical solutions for popular path-dependent options (such as lookback, barrier, and perpetual American options). Numerical examples indicate that the formulae are easy to implement, and are accurate.

## 4. Convergence of the Least Squares Monte Carlo Approach to American Option Valuation
### Author(s):
- Lars Stentoft
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) suggest a method to American option valuation based on simulation. The method is termed the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method, and although it has become widely used, not much is known about the properties of the estimator. This paper corrects this shortcoming using theory from the literature on seminonparametric series estimators. A central part of the LSM method is the approximation of a set of conditional expectation functions. We show that the approximations converge to the true expectation functions under general assumptions in a multiperiod, multidimensional setting. We obtain convergence rates in the two-period, multidimensional case, and we discuss the relation between the optimal rate of convergence and the properties of the conditional expectation. Furthermore, we show that the actual price estimates converge to the true price. This provides the mathematical foundation for the use of the LSM method in derivatives research.

## 5. Which GARCH Model for Option Valuation?
### Author(s):
- Peter Christoffersen

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
Characterizing asset return dynamics using volatility models is an important part of empirical finance. The existing literature on GARCH models favors some rather complex volatility specifications whose relative performance is usually assessed through their likelihood based on a time series of asset returns. This paper compares a range of GARCH models along a different dimension, using option prices and returns under the risk-neutral as well as the physical probability measure. We judge the relative performance of various models by evaluating an objective function based on option prices. In contrast with returns-based inference, we find that our option-based objective function favors a relatively parsimonious model. Specifically, when evaluated out-of-sample, our analysis favors a model that, besides volatility clustering, only allows for a standard leverage effect.

## 6. Primal-Dual Simulation Algorithm for Pricing Multidimensional American Options
### Author(s):
- Leif Andersen
- Mark Broadie
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
This paper describes a practical algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulation for the pricing of multidimensional American (i.e., continuously exercisable) and Bermudan (i.e., discretely exercisable) options. The method generates both lower and upper bounds for the Bermudan option price and hence gives valid confidence intervals for the true value. Lower bounds can be generated using any number of primal algorithms. Upper bounds are generated using a new Monte Carlo algorithm based on the duality representation of the Bermudan value function suggested independently in Haugh and Kogan (2004) and Rogers (2002). Our proposed algorithm can handle virtually any type of process dynamics, factor structure, and payout specification. Computational results for a variety of multifactor equity and interest-rate options demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we use the proposed method to examine and verify the tightness of frequently used exercise rules in Bermudan swaption markets.

## 7. Pricing Path-Dependent Securities by the Extended Tree Method
### Author(s):
- Naoki Kishimoto
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
This paper presents a discrete-time method (ET method) for pricing path-dependent securities by the supplementary variable technique and examines the ET method from the point of view of Arrow-Debreu event tree. In particular, this paper identifies sufficient conditions on supplementary variables under which the ET method yields the same price for a path-dependent security as a valuation method based on a comparable Arrow-Debreu event tree. Two examples are provided to illustrate the ET method. The first example is a valuation of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), where the collateral of a CMO is modeled as a pool of mortgage loans with heterogeneous prepayment costs. The second example is a valuation of American average options where the average is computed over a moving period with a fixed length. In addition, this paper presents a measure for the computational size of the ET method and illustrates numerical advantages of the ET method with examples.

## 8. Dividends and Debt with Managerial Agency and Lender Holdup
### Author(s):
- George Kanatas
- Jianping Qi
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
A well-known view in the literature is that if management is more concerned with the firm's survival than with profitability, it is efficient to use a levered capital structure and thereby transfer the liquidation decision to lenders. Our paper extends this idea to a setting where lenders behave opportunistically when they control the liquidation decision. We show that in this situation, an optimal mix of debt and dividends can mitigate the twin moral hazard problems of the manager and the lender. Given an otherwise optimal capital structure, initiating a dividend policy increases firm value, lowers debt payments, but raises total cash disbursements—interest and dividends—to investors. Numerous other empirical implications of the model are also discussed.

## 9. A Comparison of VaR and CVaR Constraints on Portfolio Selection with the Mean-Variance Model
### Author(s):
- Gordon J. Alexander
- Alexandre M. Baptista
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze the portfolio selection implications arising from imposing a value-at-risk (VaR) constraint on the mean-variance model, and compare them with those arising from the imposition of a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint. We show that for a given confidence level, a CVaR constraint is tighter than a VaR constraint if the CVaR and VaR bounds coincide. Consequently, a CVaR constraint is more effective than a VaR constraint as a tool to control slightly risk-averse agents, but in the absence of a risk-free security, has a perverse effect in that it is more likely to force highly risk-averse agents to select portfolios with larger standard deviations. However, when the CVaR bound is appropriately larger than the VaR bound or when a risk-free security is present, a CVaR constraint “dominates” a VaR constraint as a risk management tool.

## 10. Inventory Management with Asset-Based Financing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
Most of the traditional models in production and inventory control ignore the financial states of an organization and can lead to infeasible practices in real systems. This paper is the first attempt to incorporate asset-based financing into production decisions. Instead of setting a known, exogenously determined budgetary constraint as most existing models suggest, we model the available cash in each period as a function of assets and liabilities that may be updated periodically according to the dynamics of the production activities. Furthermore, our models allow different interest rates on cash balance and outstanding loans, which is an enhancement over most traditional models in that inventory financed by a loan may be more expensive than that by out-of-pocket cash. We demonstrate the importance of joint consideration of production and financing decisions in a start-up setting in which the ability to grow the firm is mainly constrained by its limited capital and dependence on bank financing. We then explain the motivation for asset-based financing by examining the decision making at a bank and a set of retailers in a newsvendor setting.

## 11. Decentralized Pricing and Capacity Decisions in a Multitier System with Modular Assembly
### Author(s):
- Fernando Bernstein
- Gregory A. DeCroix
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2004
### Abstract:
We model a modular assembly system in which a final assembler outsources some of the assembly task to first-tier suppliers (subassemblers), who produce modules made up of multiple components. The assembler sets module prices it will pay to the subassemblers, the subassemblers set component prices they will pay to suppliers, and then all players choose how much capacity to install, with the minimum capacity choice determining system capacity. Finally, stochastic end-product demand is observed and all players produce (and are paid for) the same number of units—the minimum of demand and system capacity.
