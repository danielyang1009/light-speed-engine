### Abstract:
The development of the information systems (IS) literature in Management Science during the past 50 years reflects the inception, growth, and maturation of several different research streams. The five research streams we identify incorporate different definitions of the managerial problems that relate to IS, the alternate theoretical perspectives and different methodological paradigms to study them, and the levels of the organization at which their primary results impact managerial practice. The decision support and design science research stream studies the application of computers in decision support, control, and managerial decision making. The value of information research stream reflects relationships established based on economic analysis of information as a commodity in the management of the firm. The human-computer systems design research stream emphasizes the cognitive basis for effective systems design. The IS organization and strategy research stream focuses the level of analysis on the locus of value of the IS investment instead of on the perceptions of a system or its user. The economics of information systems and technology research stream emphasizes the application of theoretical perspectives and methods from analytical and empirical economics to managerial problems involving IS and information technologies (IT). Based on a discussion of these streams, we evaluate the IS literature's core contributions to theoretical and managerial knowledge, and make some predictions about the road that lies ahead for IS researchers.

### Abstract:
This paper examines search across competing e-commerce sites. By analyzing panel data from over 10,000 Internet households and three commodity-like products (books, compact discs (CDs), and air travel services), we show that the amount of online search is actually quite limited. On average, households visit only 1.2 book sites, 1.3 CD sites, and 1.8 travel sites during a typical active month in each category. Using probabilistic models, we characterize search behavior at the individual level in terms of (1) depth of search, (2) dynamics of search, and (3) activity of search.

## 3. Long-Distance Access Network Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
Long-distance telephone companies in the United States pay access fees to local telephone companies to transport calls that originate and terminate on their networks. These charges form the largest portion of the cost of providing long-distance service. Recent changes in the structure of access rates, which were mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), have created opportunities for long-distance companies to better manage access costs. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based approach to the economic design of access networks. Our novel solution approach combines stochastic aspects of the problem with a challenging discrete facility location problem in a three-phase algorithm. Computational results indicate a potential cost savings of hundreds of millions of dollars annually for long-distance companies.

## 4. Dynamic Conversion Behavior at E-Commerce Sites
### Author(s):
- Wendy W. Moe
- Peter S. Fader
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model of conversion behavior (i.e., converting store visits into purchases) that predicts each customer's probability of purchasing based on an observed history of visits and purchases. We offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically, we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components: one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the complexity of these two key components and also compare our general framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties, including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying online buyer behavior.

## 5. Suckers Are Born but Markets Are Made: Individual Rationality, Arbitrage, and Market Efficiency on an Electronic Futures Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
The Iowa Electronic Markets are specially designed futures markets that appear to aggregate information efficiently to predict events such as election outcomes. Yet, in theory, perfect information aggregation is impossible. Further, the markets are populated by a nonrepresentative sample of mistake-prone and biased traders. That is, traders are prone to the behavioral anomalies predicted by behavioral finance. How can this be reconciled with market efficiency? Here, we take a first step by analyzing the behavior of two self-selected types of traders. Dramatic differences in mistake rates across traders can help us answer the question. Market-making traders who set prices are less mistake prone and appear to be more rational than price-taking traders. This highlights an important feature of markets: marginal (in this case, market making), not average, traders set prices. This can drive the efficiency of market prices in spite of large numbers of traders who display patently suboptimal behavior.

## 6. Work Groups, Structural Diversity, and Knowledge Sharing in a Global Organization
### Author(s):
- Jonathon N. Cummings
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
Effective work groups engage in external knowledge sharingâ€”the exchange of information, know-how, and feedback with customers, organizational experts, and others outside of the group. This paper argues that the value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings. Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around the integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.

## 7. Analysis and Optimization of a Multistage Inventory-Queue System

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
An important issue in the management of supply chains and manufacturing systems is to control inventory costs at different locations throughout the system while satisfying an end-customer service-level requirement. The challenge involved is to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem that captures the key dynamics of a complex production-inventory system. In this paper, we first develop a multistage inventory-queue model and a job-queue decomposition approach that evaluates the performance of serial manufacturing and supply systems with inventory control at every stage. We then present an efficient procedure to minimize the overall inventory in the system while meeting the required service level. Our technique is relatively simple and delivers accurate performance estimates. Furthermore, numerical studies generate certain managerial insights into related design and control issues.

## 8. A Polyhedral Approach for the Staff Rostering Problem
### Author(s):
- Giovanni Felici
- Claudio Gentile
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
In this paper we formulate and efficiently solve staff scheduling problems for large organizations that provide continuous services to customers. We describe an integer programming approach for a class of such problems, where solutions have to obey a number of constraints related to workload balancing, shift compatibility, and distribution of days off. The formulation of the constraints is general and can be extended to different personnel management problems where staff members must cover shifts, and management must assign a fixed number of days off per week. The model maximizes staff satisfaction, expressed by positive weights for pairs of shifts in consecutive days. We consider the associated polytope and study its structure, determining some classes of inequalities that are facet inducing for special subproblems and other valid classes. We also identify a particular subproblem whose solution can be used to determine strong cuts for the complete problem. In addition, we design special branching rules that break the symmetries that arise in the solution space and have a large impact in the efficiency of the method. The validity of this approach has been ascertained by extensive computational tests; moreover, the operations research (OR) department of an airline has implemented the method to solve ground staff management problems.

## 9. Productivity Effects of Organizational Change: Microeconometric Evidence
### Author(s):
- Irene Bertschek
- Ulrich Kaiser
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the relationship between investment in information and communication technologies (ICT), non-ICT investment, labor productivity, and workplace reorganization. Firms are assumed to reorganize workplaces if the productivity gains arising from workplace reorganization exceed the associated reorganization costs. Two different types of organizational change are considered: enhancement group work and flattening of hierarchies. Empirical evidence is provided for a sample of 411 firms from the German business-related services sector.

## 10. Multistage Monte Carlo Method for Solving Influence Diagrams Using Local Computation
### Author(s):
- John M. Charnes
- Prakash P. Shenoy
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
The main goal of this paper is to describe a new multistage Monte Carlo (MMC) simulation method for solving influence diagrams using local computation. Global methods have been proposed by others that sample from the joint probability distribution of all the variables in the influence diagram. However, for influence diagrams having many variables, the state space of all variables grows exponentially, and the sample sizes required for good estimates may be too large to be practical. In this paper, we develop a MMC method, which samples only a small set of chance variables for each decision node in the influence diagram. MMC is akin to methods developed for exact solution of influence diagrams in that we limit the number of chance variables sampled at any time. Because influence diagrams model each chance variable with a conditional probability distribution, the MMC method lends itself well to influence diagram representations.

## 11. Noteâ€”Commonality Strategies: Value Drivers and Equivalence with Flexible Capacity and Inventory Substitution
### Author(s):
- Jan A. Van Mieghem
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2004
### Abstract:
Commonality strategies assemble different products from at least one common component and one other product-specific component. The distinguishing feature of commonality, i.e., the presence of dedicated components to be assembled with a common component, is shown to be mathematically inconsequential in the sense that the unified commonality problem for two products can be reduced to an equivalent substitution flexibility problem without those dedicated components. This significant simplification provides the first general, closed-form condition for commonality adoption and identifies its value drivers. Commonality is optimal even for perfectly correlated demands if products have sufficiently different margins. This introduces the "revenue-maximization option" of commonality as a second benefit that is independent of the traditional risk-pooling benefit. "Pure commonality" strategies are never optimal unless complexity costs are introduced. Dual sourcing, externalities, and operational hedging features of commonality are discussed.
