## 3. Manufacturer Benefits from Information Integration with Retail Customers

### Abstract:
Information integration efforts between manufacturers and retailers, in the form of information sharing, synchronized replenishment, and collaborative product design and development, have been cited as major means to improve supply chain performance. This paper develops a conceptual framework that relates information-integration initiatives to manufacturer profitability. The framework allows such initiatives to impact inventory management and revenue-enhancing measures that, in turn, increase manufacturer profit margins, or affect profit margins directly. Through an extensive survey in the food and consumer packaged goods industry, we empirically examine this framework. The analysis reveals that the various integration techniques are differentially associated with manufacturer performance. Collaborative planning on replenishment, in the form of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is directly and positively related to manufacturer margins, while collaboration on new products and services is positively related to intermediate performance measures. Specifically, this latter form of collaboration allows the manufacturer to charge higher wholesale prices and, interestingly, is associated with lower retailer, and consequently manufacturer, stockouts. In contrast, collaboration on the handling of excess and defective retailer inventory (i.e., reverse logistics) results in higher manufacturer stockout levels, on average. Solely sharing information on either inventory levels or customer needs is associated with higher manufacturer performance measures up to a certain point; sharing this information is prevalent among manufacturers that achieve industry-average profitability relative to those that achieve below industry-average profitability. The paper explains these results in the context of the conceptual framework developed and discusses the managerial implications for effective coordination between supply chain partners.

## 4. Retailer- vs. Vendor-Managed Inventory and Brand Competition

### Abstract:
Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is emerging as a significant development in the recent trend towards collaboration and information sharing in supply chain management. Transfer of inventory monitoring and other overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers might be interested in VMI. We show that VMI intensifies the competition between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch to another brand if their “preferred” brand is out of stock. The manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand, not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock. When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMI restores the competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.

## 5. Supply Chain Decision Making: Will Shorter Cycle Times and Shared Point-of-Sale Information Necessarily Help?
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Using a simulated supply chain experiment based on the well-known “beer game,” we examine how changes in order and delivery cycles, availability of shared point-of-sale (POS) information, and the pattern of customer demand affect supply chain efficiency. We find that speeding up cycle time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is beneficial depends on the nature of the demand pattern represented by the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply line.

### Abstract:
Consider a retailer who sells perishable seasonal products with uncertain demand. Due to the short sales season and long replenishment lead times associated with such products, the retailer is unable to update demand forecasts by using actual sales data generated from the early part of the season and to respond by replenishing stocks during the season. To overcome this limitation, we examine the case in which the retailer develops a program called the “advance booking discount” (ABD) program that entices customers to commit to their orders at a discount price prior to the selling season. The time between placement and fulfillment of these precommitted orders provides an opportunity for the retailer to update demand forecasts by utilizing information generated from the precommitted orders and to respond by placing a cost-effective order at the beginning of the selling season. In this paper, we evaluate the benefits of the ABD program and characterize the optimal discount price that maximizes the retailer’s expected profit.

## 7. Setting Customer Expectation in Service Delivery: An Integrated Marketing-Operations Perspective
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2004
### Abstract:
Service firms have increasingly been competing for market share on the basis of delivery time. Many firms now choose to set customer expectation by announcing their maximal delivery time. Customers will be satisfied if their perceived delivery times are shorter than their expectations. This gap model of service quality is used in this paper to study how a firm might choose a delivery-time commitment to influence its customer expectation, and delivery quality in order to maximize its market share. A market share model is developed to capture (1) the impact of delivery-time commitment and delivery quality on the firm's market share and (2) the impact of the firm's market share and process variability on delivery quality when there is a congestion effect. We show that the choice of the delivery-time commitment requires a proper balance between the level of service capacity and customer sensitivities to delivery-time expectation and delivery quality. We prove the existence of Nash equilibria in a duopolistic competition, and show that this delivery-time commitment game is analogous to a Prisoners' Dilemma.

## 8. When Not All Conflict Is Bad: Manufacturing-Marketing Conflict and Strategic Incentive Design
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2004
### Abstract:
Researchers and managers broadly agree that coordination and harmony between manufacturing and marketing improve firm performance by eliminating suboptimal practices within the firm. In this paper, we present a contrasting view of the manufacturing-marketing interface. We model a duopoly in which the firms compete on price and quality dimensions. The manufacturing and marketing managers within each firm are presented with conflicting incentives focused on cost minimization and revenue maximization, respectively. These managers bargain with each other before arriving at compromise decisions regarding price and quality. While frequently encountered in practice, this “conflicting-objectives puzzle” is surprising because one expects that centralized coordination by the owners of the firm towards profit maximization would lead to higher profits. In this paper, we resolve the conflicting-objectives puzzle and demonstrate that, surprisingly, the firm's resulting profits in this setting of conflict can be higher than those obtained when the decisions of the managers are perfectly coordinated. We also analyze the equilibrium in incentive plans when the owners can choose between compromise and perfect coordination. Our results offer a new interpretation of manufacturing-marketing conflict as a strategic tool that can enhance firm profits.

## 9. Managing Capacity Through Reward Programs

### Abstract:
Rewarding customers with own products or services has become an increasingly popular practice across a spectrum of industries such as airlines, hotels, and telecommunication. In these service industries, firms face demand uncertainty and strict short-term capacity constraint. When the market demand is low, firms hold excess capacities that would lead to intense price competition. In this paper we study the adoption and design of reward programs in the context of capacity management. We demonstrate that it is optimal for firms to offer capacity rewards when the market demand varies from one period to the other. By offering the reward programs, firms can effectively reduce available capacities when the market demand is low, and hence credibly show their unwillingness to undersell. Such a commitment can encourage their competitors to set their prices high. When firms provide reward programs, if a firm sets a higher price than the other and sells less today, in the future the firm can benefit from the other firm's larger reduction in available capacity through rewards. Thus, reward programs also provide additional incentives for firms to set higher current prices. Finally, since reward programs can add flexibility in adjusting the available capacities to the market demand, firms increase the size of regular capacities with reward programs.

## 10. Doing the Right Thing or Doing the Thing Right: Allocating Resources Between Marketing Research and Manufacturing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2004
### Abstract:
Matching production with sales potential is essential for survival in volatile markets. Manufacturing and marketing managers compete for staff, space, cash, and other assets as they struggle both to determine what and how many products ought to be produced, and to actually produce them. We develop an analytical framework to answer one simple question, “How much marketing research should a firm do when it takes resources away from manufacturing the goods that generate revenue?” To understand the costs and benefits of marketing research, we account for the lost opportunities to produce these goods. Some analytical findings are striking: firms without initial knowledge of their potential customers should allocate one-third of the firm's resources to marketing research. The model suggests a host of issues to be more deeply studied by management scientists.

### Abstract:
In this field study, conducted at a leading avionics guidance systems manufacturer, we gathered primary data on time and cost performance of both the design and manufacturing phases of new product development (NPD). We modeled the impact of the management levers relating to oversight, the intensity of design specialization, and the level of interaction with the customer. The study highlights the necessity of leveraging the interdependencies between the design and manufacturing phases in NPD.

## 12. New-Product Strategy and Industry Clockspeed
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2004
### Abstract:
We study how industry clockspeed, internal firm factors, such as product development, production, and inventory costs, and competitive factors determine a firm's optimal new-product introduction timing and product-quality decisions. We explicitly model market demand uncertainty, a firm's internal cost structure, and competition, using an infinite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on a large-scale numerical analysis, we find that more frequent new-product introductions are optimal under faster clockspeed conditions. In addition, we find that a firm's optimal product-quality decision is governed by a firm's relative costs of introducing new products with incremental versus more substantial improvements. We show that a time-pacing product introduction strategy results in a production policy with a simple base-stock form and performs well relative to the optimal policy. Our results thus provide analytical support for the managerial belief that industry clockspeed and time to market are closely related.

## 13. Designing Supply Contracts: Contract Type and Information Asymmetry

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2004
### Abstract:
This paper studies the value to a supplier of obtaining better information about a buyer's cost structure, and of being able to offer more general contracts. We use the bilateral monopoly setting to analyze six scenarios: three increasingly general contracts (wholesale-pricing schemes, two-part linear schemes, and twopart nonlinear schemes), each under full and incomplete information about the buyer's cost structure. We allow both sides to refuse to trade by explicitly including reservation profit levels for both; for the supplier, this is implemented through a cutoff policy. We derive the supplier's optimal contracts and profits for all six scenarios and examine the value of information and of more general contracts. Our key findings are as follows: First, the value of information is higher under two-part contracts; second, the value of offering two-part contracts is higher under full information; and third, the proportion of buyers the supplier will choose to exclude can be substantial.
