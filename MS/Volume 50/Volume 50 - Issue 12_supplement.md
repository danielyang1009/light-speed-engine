## 3. Dynamic Version of the Economic Lot Size Model
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
- Thomson M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2004
### Abstract:
A forward algorithm for a solution to the following dynamic version of the economic lot size model is given: allowing the possibility of demands for a single item, inventory holding charges, and setup costs to vary over N periods, we desire a minimum total cost inventory management scheme which satisfies known demand in every period. Disjoint planning horizons are shown to be possible which eliminate the necessity of having data for the full N periods.

## 15. Comments on A New Product Growth for Model Consumer Durables The Bass Model
### Author(s):
- Frank M. Bass
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2004
### Abstract:
The paper that I authored and that was published in Management Science in 1969 (Bass 1969) has become widely known as the Bass Model (see Morrison and Raju 2004). The model of the diffusion of new products and technologies developed in the paper is one of the most widely applied models in management science. It was especially gratifying for me to learn that INFORMS members have voted the Bass Model paper as one of the Top 10 Most Influential Papers published in the 50-year history of Management Science in connection with the 50th anniversary of the journal. In this commentary on the paper I shall discuss some background and history of the development of the paper, the reasons why the model has been influential, some important extensions of the model, some examples of applications, and some examples of the frontiers of research involving the Bass Model. In the current period, in which there is much discussion about the marketing of applications of management science methods and practice, I hope that this commentary will be useful in providing insights about some of the properties of models that will be applied.

## 17. Comments on Models and Managers: The Concept of a Decision Calculus
### Author(s):
- John D. C. Little
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2004
### Abstract:
Managerial models for practice have undergone remarkable growth in the past 50 years. My paper on decision calculus, published in 1970, was both a progress report and a prescription for improvement. This commentary describes why I wrote the paper, my perception of why it has been considered influential, and a brief overview of what has happened since. The overview starts by tracing the trends and ideas of the 1960s into the 1970s. The 1970s blend easily into the era of decision support systems (DSS). Starting late in the decade and still continuing, DSSs have evolved rapidly due to an explosion of data, increased computer power, and advances in modeling methods. I review highlights of this evolution from the point of view of managerial models, giving special emphasis to marketing, since that has been my window on this world. The good news is that more managers than ever are using models. The bad news is that many managers do not even realize they are using models! (But we should ask whether this is really bad.) The commentary concludes with thoughts about the future of managerial models.

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2004
### Abstract:
In this commentary, we trace back how we pursued research on the bullwhip effect, which resulted in the article published in Management Science. We reflect on the evolution of this concept, the impact that our work has had on industry, the way our work has been used in the teaching of supply chain management, and the key directions of research that have taken place since then.
