## 1. 50th Anniversay Article: The Strategy Field from the Perspective of Management Science: Divergent Strands and Possible Integration
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We reflect on the evolution of the strategy field as seen through the window of Management Science. Reflecting the diverse disciplinary roots of strategy research, we identify a broad-ranging body of work that varies with respect to the assumptions made regarding individual rationality and the level of analysis at which the research is carried out. We argue that recent developments begin to delineate a potentially unifying conceptual framework for treating the field's defining questions—the conceptual apparatus of evolutionary economics. We conclude by laying out important challenges for evolutionary economics if it is to serve as a foundation for both the positive and the normative research agendas of the strategy field.

## 2. How Do Value Creation and Competition Determine Whether a Firm Appropriates Value?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
How does competition among economic actors determine the value that each is able to appropriate? We provide a formal, general framework within which this question can be posed and answered, and then provide several results. Chief among them is a condition that is both required for, and guarantees, value appropriation. We apply our methodology to (i) assess the familiar notion that uniqueness, inimitability, and competition imply value appropriation, and (ii) determine the value appropriation possibilities for an innovator whose unique discovery is of use to several others who can compete for the right to use it.

## 3. Selectionism and Learning in Projects with Complexity and Unforeseeable Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
Companies innovating in dynamic environments face the combined challenge of unforeseeable uncertainty (the inability to recognize the relevant influence variables and their functional relationships; thus, events and actions cannot be planned ahead of time) and high complexity (large number of variables and interactions; this leads to difficulty in assessing optimal actions beforehand).

## 4. Two Faces: Effects of Business Groups on Innovation in Emerging Economies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
This paper shows that business groups in emerging economies exert dual effects on innovation. While groups facilitate innovation by providing institutional infrastructure, groups also discourage innovation by creating entry barriers for nongroup firms and thereby inhibit the proliferation of new ideas. This pattern reflects an evolutionary process in which the interplay of the availability of innovation infrastructure and variety of ideas influences the level of innovation in an industry. We show that group market share has an inverted-U impact on innovation in industrial sectors of both Korea and Taiwan during the 1981–1995 period. Institutional differences between Korea and Taiwan in terms of market structure and industrial policies lead to different innovation thresholds, the point at which the marginal costs of increasing group share begin to dominate the marginal benefits in the two countries.

## 5. From T-Mazes to Labyrinths: Learning from Model-Based Feedback
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
Many organizational actions need not have any immediate or direct payoff consequence but set the stage for subsequent actions that bring the organization toward some actual payoff. Learning in such settings poses the challenge of credit assignment (Minsky 1961), that is, how to assign credit for the overall outcome of a sequence of actions to each of the antecedent actions. To explore the process of learning in such contexts, we create a formal model in which the actors develop a mental model of the value of stage-setting actions as a complex problem-solving task is repeated. Partial knowledge, either of particular states in the problem space or inefficient and circuitous routines through the space, is shown to be quite valuable. Because of the interdependence of intelligent action when a sequence of actions must be identified, however, organizational knowledge is relatively fragile. As a consequence, while turnover may stimulate search and have largely benign implications in less interdependent task settings, it is very destructive of the organization's near-term performance when the learning problem requires a complementarity among the actors' knowledge.

## 6. Redesigning Teams and Incentives in a Merger: An Experiment with Managers and Students

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
After a merger, company officials face the challenge of making compensation schemes uniform and of redesigning teams with managers from companies with different incentives, work habits, and recruiting methods. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between executive pay and performance after a merger by dissociating the respective influence of shifts, which occur in both compensation incentives and team composition. The results of a real task experiment conducted with managers within a large pharmaceutical company not only show that changes in compensation incentives affect performance, but also suggest that the sorting effect of incentives in the previous companies impact cooperation and efficiency after the merger. Replicating this experiment with students showed differences in strategy rather than in substance between the two groups of subjects with managers appearing performance driven, while students are more cost driven.

## 7. Efficient Diversification According to Stochastic Dominance Criteria
### Author(s):
- Timo Kuosmanen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
This paper develops the first operational tests of portfolio efficiency based on the general stochastic dominance (SD) criteria that account for an infinite set of diversification strategies. The main insight is to preserve the cross-sectional dependence of asset returns when forming portfolios by reexpressing the SD criteria in T-dimensional Euclidean space, with elements representing rates of return in T different states of nature. We characterize subsets of this state-space that dominate a given evaluated return vector by first- and second-order SD. This allows us to derive simple SD efficiency measures and test statistics, computable by standard mathematical programming algorithms. The SD tests and efficiency measures are illustrated by an empirical application that analyzes industrial diversification of the market portfolio.

## 8. Jump Bidding Strategies in Internet Auctions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
Abidding strategy commonly observed in Internet auctions is that of “jump bidding,” or entering a bid larger than what is necessary to be a currently winning bidder. In this paper, we argue that the cost associated with entering online bids and the uncertainty about future entry—both of which distinguish Internet from live auctions—can explain this behavior. We present a simple theoretical model that includes the preceding characteristics, and derive the conditions under which jump bidding arises in a format commonly used for online trading, the ascending-price auction. We also present evidence, recorded from hundreds of Internet auctions, that is consistent with some of the basic predictions from our model. We find that jump bidding is more likely earlier in an auction, when jumping has a larger strategic value, and that the incentives to jump bid increase as competition increases. Our results also indicate that jump bidding is effective: Jump bidders place fewer bids overall, and increased early jump bidding deters entry later in the auction. We also discuss possible means of reducing bidding costs and evidence that Internet auctioneers are pursuing this goal.

## 9. The Optimal Timing of Living-Donor Liver Transplantation

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
Living donors are a significant and increasing source of livers for transplantation, mainly because of the insufficient supply of cadaveric organs. We consider the problem of optimally timing a living-donor liver transplant to maximize the patient's total reward, such as quality-adjusted life expectancy. We formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model in which the state of the process is described by patient health. We derive structural properties of the MDP model, including a set of intuitive conditions that ensure the existence of a control-limit optimal policy. We use clinical data in our computational experiments, which show that the optimal policy is typically of control-limit type.

## 10. Demand Allocation in Multiple-Product, Multiple-Facility, Make-to-Stock Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of allocating demand arising from multiple products to multiple production facilities with finite capacity and load-dependent lead times. Production facilities can choose to manufacture items either to stock or to order. Products vary in their demand rates, holding and backordering costs, and service-level requirements. We develop models and solution procedures to determine the optimal allocation of demand to facilities and the optimal inventory level for products at each facility. We consider two types of demand allocation, one in which we allow the demand for a product to be split among multiple facilities and the other in which demand from each product must be entirely satisfied by a single facility. We also consider two forms of inventory warehousing, one in which inventory locations are factory based and one in which they are centralized. For each case, we offer a solution procedure to obtain optimal demand allocations and optimal inventory base-stock levels. For systems with multiple customer classes, we also determine optimal inventory rationing levels for each class for each product. We use the models to characterize analytically several properties of the optimal solution. In particular, we highlight eight principles that relate the effects of cost, congestion, inventory pooling, multiple sourcing, customer segmentation, inventory rationing, and process and demand variability.

## 11. Efficiency-Driven Heavy-Traffic Approximations for Many-Server Queues with Abandonments
### Author(s):
- Ward Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2004
### Abstract:
To provide useful practical insight into the performance of service-oriented (non-revenue-generating) call centers, which often provide low-to-moderate quality of service, this paper investigates the efficiency-driven (ED), many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime for queues with abandonments. Attention is focused on the M/M/s/r + M model, having a Poisson arrival process, exponential service times, s servers, r extra waiting spaces, exponential abandon times (the final +M), and the first-come–first-served service discipline. Both the number of servers and the arrival rate are allowed to increase, while the individual service and abandonment rates are held fixed. The key is how the two limits are related: In the now common quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) or Halfin-Whitt limiting regime, the probability of initially being delayed approaches a limit strictly between 0 and 1, while the probability of eventually being served (not abandoning) approaches 1. In contrast, in the ED limiting regime, the probability of eventually being served approaches a limit strictly between 0 and 1, while the probability of initially being delayed approaches 1. To obtain the ED regime, it suffices to let the arrival rate and the number of servers increase with the traffic intensity ρ held fixed with ρ > 1 (so that the arrival rate exceeds the maximum possible service rate). The ED regime can be realistic because with the abandonments, the delays need not be extraordinarily large. When the ED appropriations are appropriate, they are appealing because they are remarkably simple.
