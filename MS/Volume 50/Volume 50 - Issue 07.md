## 1. 50th Anniversary Article: Stochastic Simulation Research in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Barry L. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
When the simulation department of Management Science was created in 1978 it ushered in an era of significant methodological advances in stochastic simulation. However, the foundation for the field—not just the work that has been published in Management Science—was provided by two papers published long before simulation had its own department in the journal. We will review the seminal papers of Conway, Johnson, and Maxwell (1959) and Conway (1963), and then trace their impact through eight award-winning papers that appeared much later in Management Science.

## 2. Pricing and Priority Auctions in Queueing Systems with a Generalized Delay Cost Structure
### Author(s):
- Philipp Afèche
- Haim Mendelson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
This paper studies alternative price-service mechanisms for a provider that serves customers whose delay cost depends on their service valuations. We propose a generalized delay cost structure that augments the standard additive model with a multiplicative component, capturing the interdependence between delay cost and values. We derive and compare the revenue-maximizing and socially optimal equilibria under uniform pricing, preemptive, and nonpreemptive priority auctions with an admission price. We find that the delay cost structure has a paramount effect on system behavior. The classical result that the revenue-maximizing admission price is higher and the utilization lower than is socially optimal can be reversed under our generalized structure, and we identify the conditions driving this reversal under each mechanism. We show that the conditional bid equilibria are unique and induce the socially optimal allocations. The auctions yield gains in system net value and provider profit over uniform pricing, which are dramatically larger for the preemptive mechanism. Both auctions perform better under multiplicative compared to additive delay costs. The highest-value customers always gain under the preemptive, but may lose under the nonpreemptive auction. The lowest-value customers always gain in either auction.

## 3. A Fast Cross-Entropy Method for Estimating Buffer Overflows in Queueing Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a fast adaptive importance sampling method for the efficient simulation of buffer overflow probabilities in queueing networks. The method comprises three stages. First, we estimate the minimum cross-entropy tilting parameter for a small buffer level; next, we use this as a starting value for the estimation of the optimal tilting parameter for the actual (large) buffer level. Finally, the tilting parameter just found is used to estimate the overflow probability of interest. We study various properties of the method in more detail for the M/M/1 queue and conjecture that similar properties also hold for quite general queueing networks. Numerical results support this conjecture and demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

## 4. Modeling Daily Arrivals to a Telephone Call Center
### Author(s):
- Athanassios N. Avramidis

- Pierre L'Ecuyer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
We develop stochastic models of time-dependent arrivals, with focus on the application to call centers. Our models reproduce three essential features of call center arrivals observed in recent empirical studies: a variance larger than the mean for the number of arrivals in any given time interval, a time-varying arrival intensity over the course of a day, and nonzero correlation between the arrival counts in different periods within the same day. For each of the new models, we characterize the joint distribution of the vector of arrival counts, with particular focus on characterizing how the new models are more flexible than standard or previously proposed models. We report empirical results from a study on arrival data from a real-life call center, including the essential features of the arrival process, the goodness of fit of the estimated models, and the sensitivity of various simulated performance measures of the call center to the choice of arrival process model.

## 5. Valuation of Commodity-Based Swing Options
### Author(s):
- Patrick Jaillet
- Ehud I. Ronn
- Stathis Tompaidis
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
In the energy markets, in particular the electricity and natural gas markets, many contracts incorporate flexibility-of-delivery options known as “swing” or “take-or-pay” options. Subject to daily as well as periodic constraints, these contracts permit the option holder to repeatedly exercise the right to receive greater or smaller amounts of energy. We extract market information from forward prices and volatilities and build a pricing framework for swing options based on a one-factor mean-reverting stochastic process for energy prices that explicitly incorporates seasonal effects. We present a numerical scheme for the valuation of swing options calibrated for the case of natural gas.

## 6. Random Walks and Sustained Competitive Advantage
### Author(s):
- Jerker Denrell
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
Strategy is concerned with sustained interfirm profitability differences. Observations of such sustained differences are often attributed to unobserved systematic a priori differences in firm characteristics. This paper shows that sustained interfirm profitability differences may be very likely even if there are no a priori differences among firms. As a result of the phenomenon of long leads in random walks, even a random resource accumulation process is likely to produce persistent resource heterogeneity and sustained interfirm profitability differences. A Cournot model in which costs follow a random walk shows that such a process could produce evidence of substantial persistence of profitability. The results suggest that persistent profitability does not necessarily provide strong evidence for systematic a priori differences among firms. Nevertheless, since the phenomenon of long leads is highly unrepresentative of intuitive notions of random sequences, such evidence may still be persuasive.

## 7. Pre-IPO Operational and Financial Decisions
### Author(s):

- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
Many owners of growing privately held firms make operational and financial decisions in an effort to maximize the expected present value of the proceeds from an initial public offering (IPO). We ask: “What is the right time to make an IPO?” and “How should operational and financial decisions be coordinated to increase the likelihood of a successful IPO?” Financial and operational decisions in this problem are linked because adequate financial capital is crucial for operational decisions to be feasible and operational decisions affect the firm's access to financial resources. The IPO event is treated as a stopping time in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process. Unlike traditional stopping-time models, at every stage the model includes other decisions such as production, sales, and loan size. The results include (1) characterization of an optimal capacity-expansion policy, (2) sufficient conditions for a monotone threshold rule to yield an optimal IPO decision, and (3) algorithmic implications of results in (1) and (2).

## 8. Self-Interested Routing in Queueing Networks
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
We study self-interested routing in stochastic networks, taking into account the discrete stochastic dynamics of such networks. We analyze a two-station multiclass queueing network in which the system manager chooses the scheduling rule and individual customers choose routes in a self-interested manner. We show that this network can be unstable in Nash equilibrium under some scheduling rules. We also design a nontrivial scheduling rule that negates the performance degradation resulting from self-interested routing and achieves a Nash equilibrium with performance comparable to the first-best solution.

## 9. Assessing Data Quality for Information Products: Impact of Selection, Projection, and Cartesian Product
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
The cost associated with making decisions based on poor-quality data is quite high. Consequently, the management of data quality and the quality of associated data management processes has become critical for organizations. An important first step in managing data quality is the ability to measure the quality of information products (derived data) based on the quality of the source data and associated processes used to produce the information outputs. We present a methodology to determine two data quality characteristics—accuracy and completeness—that are of critical importance to decision makers. We examine how the quality metrics of source data affect the quality for information outputs produced using the relational algebra operations selection, projection, and Cartesian product. Our methodology is general, and can be used to determine how quality characteristics associated with diverse data sources affect the quality of the derived data.

## 10. Eliminating Public Knowledge Biases in Information-Aggregation Mechanisms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
We present a novel methodology for identifying public knowledge and eliminating the biases it creates when aggregating information in small group settings. A two-stage mechanism consisting of an information market and a coordination game is used to reveal and adjust for individuals' public information. A nonlinear aggregation of their decisions then allows for the calculation of the probability of the future outcome of an uncertain event, which can then be compared to both the objective probability of its occurrence and the performance of the market as a whole. Experiments show that this nonlinear aggregation mechanism outperforms both the imperfect market and the best of the participants.

## 11. Markov Perfect Equilibrium Advertising Strategies of Lanchester Duopoly Model: A Technical Note
### Author(s):
- Ramla Jarrar
- Guiomar Martín-Herrán
- Georges Zaccour
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2004
### Abstract:
We propose a numerical approach to compute stationary Markov perfect Nash equilibrium advertising strategies of the Lanchester model. The algorithm can be implemented using a standard mathematical package, and, importantly, it does not require that the players discount their future earnings at a zero rate, an assumption that has been made in the literature.
