- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
As part of the 50th anniversary of Management Science, the journal is publishing articles that reflect on the past, present, and future of the various subfields the journal represents. In this article, we consider decision analysis research as it has appeared in Management Science. After reviewing the foundations of decision analysis and the history of the journal’s decision analysis department, we review a number of key developments in decision analysis research that have appeared in Management Science and offer some comments on the current state of the field.

## 2. Keeping Doors Open: The Effect of Unavailability on Incentives to Keep Options Viable
### Author(s):
- Jiwoong Shin

### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
Many of the options available to decision makers, such as college majors and romantic partners, can become unavailable if sufficient effort is not invested in them (taking classes, sending flowers). The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way people value such options. In four experiments using “door games,” we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.

## 3. Consumer Habituation
### Author(s):
- Luc Wathieu
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
This paper examines how consumers’ willingness to pay for goods is determined by past patterns of consumption. The central result is a theorem of interior maximum, which states that willingness to pay for a good is maximized at a moderate level of habitual consumption. The theorem is derived from a simple model of adaptive behavior that involves a shifting S-shaped value function. The detailed analysis of the impact of consumption frequency and intensity on willingness to pay reveals an unsuspected implication of diminishing sensitivity, even as it leads to a formalization of consumer habituation patterns (including sensitization, habituation, and response recovery upon withdrawal) that matches and integrates the most robust empirical regularities attendant on nonassociative learning in neurobiology and behavioral psychology. An examination of the implications for demand dynamics and pricing highlights deterministic recurrent and transient patterns of consumption at higher price points.

## 4. Probability Judgments for Continuous Quantities: Linear Combinations and Calibration
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Hora
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
Expert judgment elicitation is often required in probabilistic decision making and the evaluation of risk. One measure of the quality of probability distributions given by experts is calibration–the faithfulness of the probabilities in an empirically verifiable sense. A method of measuring calibration for continuous probability distributions is presented here. A discussion of the impact of using linear rules for combining such judgments is given and an empirical demonstration is given using data collected from experts participating in a large-scale risk study. It is shown by theoretical argument that combining well-calibrated distributions of individual experts using linear rules can only result in reducing calibration. In contrast, it is demonstrated, both by example and empirically, that an equally weighted linear combination of experts who tend to be “overconfident” can produce distributions that are better calibrated than the experts’ individual distributions. Using data from training exercises, it is shown that the improvement in calibration is rapid as the number of experts is increased from one to five or six, but there is only modest improvement from increasing the number of experts beyond that point.

## 5. A Likelihood Approach to Estimating Market Equilibrium Models
### Author(s):
- Michaela Draganska
- Dipak Jain
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
This paper develops a new likelihood-based method for the simultaneous estimation of structural demand-and-supply models for markets with differentiated products. We specify an individual-level discrete-choice model of demand and derive the supply side assuming manufacturers compete in prices. The proposed estimation method considers price endogeneity through simultaneous estimation of demand and supply, allows for consumer heterogeneity, and incorporates a pricing rule consistent with economic theory.

### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
Do price promotions generate additional revenue and for whom? Which brand, category, and market conditions influence promotional benefits and their allocation across manufacturers and retailers? To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale econometric investigation of the effects of price promotions on manufacturer revenues, retailer revenues, and total profits (margins).

## 7. “Stack Them High, Let ’em Fly”: Lot-Sizing Policies When Inventories Stimulate Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
In some retail contexts, stocking large quantities of inventory may not only improve service levels, but can also stimulate demand. For products having demand rates that increase with inventory levels, we analyze the effect of stocking decisions on firm profitability to develop managerial insights regarding the structure of the optimal inventory policy, and to understand how this policy differs from traditional approaches. When inventories stimulate demand, iteratively applying the standard economic order quantity (EOQ) model–by setting the demand rate parameter equal to the observed average demand rate in prior cycles–yields an equilibrium order quantity that is robust to demand parameter misestimation, but is suboptimal. The profit-maximizing policy orders larger quantities, and can replenish inventory even before on-hand stock fully depletes. Using an extension of a standard inventory-dependent demand model from the literature, we first provide a convenient characterization of products that require early replenishment. We demonstrate that the optimal cycle time is largely governed by the conventional trade-off between ordering and holding costs, whereas the reorder point relates to a promotions-oriented cost-benefit perspective. We show that the optimal policy yields significantly higher profits than cost-based inventory policies, underscoring the importance of profit-driven inventory management.

## 8. Who Benefits from Transshipment? Exogenous vs. Endogenous Wholesale Prices
### Author(s):
- Lingxiu Dong
- Nils Rudi
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
This paper studies how transshipments affect manufacturers and retailers, considering both exogenous and endogenous wholesale prices. For a distribution system where a single manufacturer sells to multiple identical-cost retailers, we consider both the manufacturer being a price taker and the manufacturer being a price setter in a single-period setup under multivariate normal demand distribution. In the case of the manufacturer being a price taker, we provide several analytical results regarding the effects of key parameters on order quantities and profits. In the case of the manufacturer being a price setter, we characterize the Stackelberg game that arises, and provide several insights into how the game dynamics are affected by transshipments. Specifically, we find that risk pooling makes retailers’ order quantities less sensitive to the wholesale price set by the manufacturer; hence, in general, the manufacturer benefits from retailers’ transshipments by charging a higher wholesale price, while retailers are often worse off. The paper captures the effect of demand correlation and the effect of the number of retailers throughout, and it illustrates the findings by a numerical example. We also provide an interactive Web page for numerical experiments.

## 9. Flow Shop Scheduling with Partial Resource Flexibility
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
Resource flexibility refers to the ability to dynamically reallocate units of resource from one stage of a production process to another in response to shifting bottlenecks. Recent research has demonstrated that substantial improvements in operational performance can be realized in both serial- and parallel-machine production environments through the effective utilization of resource flexibility. In these contexts the resource was assumed to exhibit complete flexibility. This research explores the extent to which the operational benefits associated with resource flexibility can be achieved in a flow shop environment using a partially flexible resource. Focusing on labor flexibility, we propose corresponding metrics for partial flexibility and formulate a model for flow shop scheduling with partial resource flexibility. On the basis of computational experiments, we explore properties pertaining to the relative amounts as well as the allocation of partial resource flexibility as it is distributed across the workforce. The conclusions drawn from this research provide significant insight into the management of flow shops with a workforce that is crosstrained to achieve partial flexibility. Moreover, we extend the principles developed by Jordan and Graves (1995) for partially flexible manufacturing plants to the flow shop scheduling environment, and we link these principles in a novel way to recent research on self-buffering flow lines.

## 10. Information Transparency of Business-to-Business Electronic Markets: A Game-Theoretic Analysis
### Author(s):
- Kevin Zhu
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
The abundance of transaction data available on the Internet tends to make information more transparent in electronic marketplaces. In such a transparent environment, it becomes easier for suppliers to obtain information that may allow them to infer their rivals’ costs. Is this good news or bad news? In this study, we focus on the informational effects of business-to-business (B2B) exchanges, and explore firms’ incentives to join a B2B exchange that provides an online platform for information transmission. We then study the equilibria by developing a game-theoretic model under asymmetric information. We examine whether the incentives to join a B2B exchange would be different under different competition modes (quantity and price), different information structures, and by varying the nature of the products (substitutes and complements). Our results challenge the “information transparency hypothesis” (i.e., open sharing of information in electronic markets is beneficial to all participating firms). In contrast to the popular belief, we show that information transparency could be a double-edged sword. The individual rationality of participation in the online exchange reflects the tradeoff between information transparency and data confidentiality. This may have important implications for the microstructure design (e.g., data access rules) of B2B electronic marketplaces.

## 11. Product Variety Under Brand Influence: An Empirical Investigation of Personal Computer Demand
### Author(s):
- Kai-Lung Hui
### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
Prior research suggests that brand may influence consumer preference for differentiated products. However, the extant literature does not measure how brand value affects product similarity and consumer choice. This paper examines demand response to the proliferation of personal computers (PCs). Using both the central processing unit (CPU) and brand as segmentation variables, I construct a two-level nested generalized extreme value (GEV) discrete choice model to estimate the brand values and product similarities of a set of PC vendors. With these estimates, I infer the relative efficacy of product variety for firms which possess different degrees of brand values. My results suggest that consumers treat PCs from the same firm as close substitutes, and the proximity of the PCs correlates positively with the firms’ brand values. This finding suggests that there are decreasing demand returns to product variety for branded multiproduct firms. I discuss a few possible drivers of brand value and explore the significance of product line extension in building long-term brand reputation.

## 12. Advance Booking Discount Programs Under Retail Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2004
### Abstract:
We model a situation in which two retailers consider launching an “Advance Booking Discount” (ABD) program. In this program, customers are enticed to precommit their orders at a discount price prior to the regular selling season. However, these precommitted orders are filled during the selling season. While the ABD program enables the retailers to lock in a portion of the customer demand and use this demand information to develop more accurate forecasts and supply plans, the ABD price reduces profit margin. We analyze the four possible scenarios wherein each of the two firms offer an ABD program or not, and establish conditions under which the unique equilibrium calls for launching the ABD program at both retailers.
