### Abstract:
While the goal of OR/MS is to aid decision makers, implementation of published models occurs less frequently than one might hope. However, one area that has been significantly impacted by management science is emergency response systems. Dozens of papers on emergency service management appeared in the OR/MS literature in the 1970s alone, many of which were published in Management Science. Three of these papers won major prizes. More importantly, many of these papers led to the implementation of substantially new policies and practices, particularly in policing and firefighting. Much of this work originated in New York City, though many other cities subsequently adopted the resulting models and strategies. In this paper, we look at the context, content, and nature of the research and the factors that led to these early implementation successes. We then track the extent to which these original models are still affecting decision making in emergency response systems. We also examine the pace of development of new OR/MS models and applications in the area. Finally, we look at issues in emergency responsiveness that have emerged recently as a result of the national focus on terrorism and discuss the potential for future OR/MS modeling and application.

## 2. Converting Technology to Mitigate Environmental Damage
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
There are many situations where policy makers would like to induce firms to make a major discrete conversion in production technology to help the environment. This paper examines how heterogeneity in the operating condition of firms' plant and equipment, which cannot be observed by policy makers, can affect the choice between incentives to encourage conversion to a cleaner technology. By relating different conditions of firms' plant and equipment to production costs, extent of environmental damage, and cost of conversion to a cleaner technology, we show when a perfectly discriminating incentive to encourage conversion is not feasible. In addition, we show that firms with plant and equipment in better condition will convert their technology to mitigate their environmental damage, and firms with plant and equipment in poorer condition will not. This and a series of additional results lead to conditions under which an administratively simple uniform lump-sum incentive to switch to cleaner technology is preferable to one based on output. These results and conditions extend to cases where there are network externalities in conversion, and where there is strategic timing in firms' choice of when to convert.

## 3. Designing Marine Reserves for Fishery Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
Recent reports have raised serious concerns about the rapid declines of historically productive marine fishery resources and the degradation of essential fish habitats. This global crisis has spurred development of innovative management strategies to rebuild depleted fisheries and marine ecosystems. One highly touted strategy involves the design and creation of marine reserves (areas off limits to extractive uses) to rebuild fisheries and conserve marine biodiversity. In this paper, we propose an integrated sequence of methodologies that provides an objective, quantitative framework for the design of marine reserves in spatially heterogeneous coastal ocean environments.

## 4. Auctions of Homogeneous Goods with Increasing Returns: Experimental Comparison of Alternative “Dutch” Auctions
### Author(s):
- Elena Katok
- Alvin E. Roth
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
Most business-to-business (B2B) auctions are used to transact large quantities of homogeneous goods, and therefore use multiunit mechanisms. In the B2B context, bidders often have increasing returns to scale, or synergies. We compare two commonly used auction formats for selling multiple homogeneous objects, both sometimes called “Dutch” auctions, in a set of value environments that include synergies and potentially subject bidders to the “exposure” and “free-riding” problems. We find that the descending-price auction, best known for its use in the Dutch flower auctions, is robust and performs well in a variety of environments, although there are some situations in which the ascending uniform-price auction similar to the one used by eBay better avoids the free-riding problem. We discuss the factors that influence each mechanism's performance in terms of the overall efficiency, the informational requirements, the seller's revenue, and the buyer's profit.

## 5. Are Supply and Plant Inspections Complements or Substitutes? A Strategic and Operational Assessment of Inspection Practices in Biotechnology
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
This paper theoretically and empirically examines the conventional wisdom in procurement management that often portrays supply inspections and supplier plant inspections as substitutes. We develop a theoretical model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however, may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a) external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which depends on the level of buffer inventory, (b) when knowledge sharing between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c) when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers. We empirically evaluate our model with a new data set drawn from a large biotechnology manufacturer. Empirical results provide broad support for theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational and strategic use of inspection practices.

## 6. Modeling the Impact of Merging Capacity in Production-Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Ananth V. Iyer

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
We model two separate, decentralized systems, each consisting of a warehouse and a production capacity. The demand processes experienced by the systems have different variabilities. The two decentralized systems consider an agreement to pool their production capacities. We examine the impact of the pooling of capacity on inventory costs under two operating rules: (i) the orders from the two warehouses are treated in a first-come–first-served manner, and (ii) the orders from the lower-variability warehouse are given nonpreemptive priority.

## 7. Throughput in Serial Lines with State-Dependent Behavior
### Author(s):
- Stephen G. Powell
- Kenneth L. Schultz
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
Experimental evidence suggests that production-line workers adjust their work rates in certain situations to prevent idle time. We refer to this as state-dependent behavior, in contrast to the state-independent behavior of machines. In this paper, we develop several models for the state-dependent behavior of production workers. We then use these models to analyze the relation of line length to throughput in these systems. We find that state-dependent behavior makes serial lines more efficient and reduces the detrimental effects that longer line lengths have on throughput. In some cases, line efficiency can actually increase with length. This is a result of a higher percentage of workers having two buffers to provide feedback on the state of the line. Further, we show that workers who both speed up when they are likely to cause idle time for others and slow down when they are likely to become idle themselves improve the overall efficiency of the line.

## 8. The Performance Implications of Media Richness in a Business-to-Business Service Environment: Direct Versus Indirect Effects

### Published:

### Abstract:
This research examines media richness by modeling face-to-face, telephone, and electronic media as one construct and testing its performance implications. The context is the third-party logistics industry, in which a customer firm allows a service provider to assume responsibility for all or part of a critical business process. This business-to-business service environment is characterized by high levels of complexity (uncertainty, variability, equivocality) and network interdependence, key contextual attributes that enhance media richness' impact. We found a direct effect of media richness on relational performance and through it, indirect effects on satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, we found a direct effect of media richness on loyalty, which suggests that service firms in networked relationships provide loyalty-inducing benefits the genesis of which is not in the satisfaction created by the service itself. While past studies have examined the relationship of richness-related constructs and performance, no significant link was found. Our study is the first to demonstrate that media richness can affect firm performance when businesses interact in a complex environment.

## 9. Identifying Innovators for the Cross-Selling of New Products
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
With recent advances in information technology, most companies are amassing extensive customer databases. The wealth of information in these databases can be useful in identifying those customers most likely to purchase a new product and in predicting when this adoption may take place. This can assist database marketers in determining when individuals should be targeted for the promotion of a new product, which may increase the efficiency of manufacturing and distribution, and assure a faster return on investments. For this purpose, we propose a model that considers the timing of past purchases across multiple product categories and produces estimates of each customer's propensity of ever purchasing in a particular product category and of the timing of their purchases. The model is designed to help managers identify the best prospects for a new offer in one of multiple categories based on generalizations obtained from past offers. The proposed model also provides projections of aggregate penetration for new brands within the database, based on sample estimates.

## 10. Resource Allocation Based on Efficiency Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2004
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to a resource-allocation problem that typically appears in organizations with a centralized decision-making environment, for example, supermarket chains, banks, and universities. The central unit is assumed to be interested in maximizing the total amount of outputs produced by the individual units by allocating available resources to them. We will develop an interactive formal approach based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multiple-objective linear programming (MOLP) to find the most preferred allocation plan. The units are assumed to be able to modify their production in the current production possibility set within certain assumptions. Various assumptions are considered concerning returns to scale and the ability of each unit to modify its production plan. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the approach.
