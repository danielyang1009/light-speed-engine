### Abstract:
Motivated by applications in freight handling and open-pit mining, Rhys, Balinski, and Picard studied the problems of selection and closure in papers published in Management Science in 1970 and 1976. They identified efficient algorithms based on linear programming and maximum-flow/minimum-cut procedures to solve these problems. This research has had major impact well beyond the initial applications, reaching across three decades and inspiring work on numerous applications and extensions. The extensions are nontrivial optimization problems that are of theoretical interest. The applications ranged from evolving technologies, image segmentation, revealed preferences, pricing, adjusting utilities for consistencies, just-in-time production, solving certain integer programs in polynomial time, and providing efficient 2-approximation algorithms for a wide variety of hard problems. A recent generalization to a convex objective function has even produced novel solutions to prediction and Bayesian estimation problems. This paper surveys the streams of research stimulated by these papers as an example of the impact of Management Science on the optimization field and an illustration of the far-reaching implications of good original research.

### Abstract:
Airlines are continually faced with the challenge of efficient utilization of their cockpit crew resources. In addition to regular flying crews, airlines maintain significant reserve staffing levels to meet contractual obligations and provide smooth daily operations. Most airlines also depend on voluntary and involuntary flying by regular crews to cover trips that fall out of work schedules due to conflicts and disruptions (open time trips). These open time trips, combined with expected levels of voluntary and involuntary flying, affect reserve staffing levels; airlines must plan crew staffing in advance to meet resulting training and new-hire requirements. Inefficient operational reserve utilization can further affect long-range crew staffing, resulting in higher training and new-hire costs. The proposed optimization strategy to estimate long-range crew staffing combines operational reserve utilization and premium operational costs due to voluntary and involuntary flying with long-range business needs.

## 3. Capacity Expansion for Random Exponential Demand Growth with Lead Times
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
The combination of demand uncertainty and a lead time for adding capacity creates the risk of capacity shortage during the lead time. We formulate a model of capacity expansion for uncertain exponential demand growth and deterministic expansion lead times when there is an obligation to provide a specified level of service. The service level, defined in terms of the ratio of expected lead-time shortage to installed capacity, is guaranteed by timing each expansion to begin when demand reaches a fixed proportion of the capacity position. Under this timing rule, the optimal facilities to install can be determined by solving an equivalent deterministic problem without lead times. Numerical results show the effects of the demand parameters and lead-time length on the expansion timing. The interaction of timing with expansion size is explored for the case when continuous facility sizes are available with economies of scale.

### Published:

### Abstract:
We present a very large-scale neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem with single-source constraints. The neighborhood structures are induced by customer multi-exchanges and by facility moves. We consider both traditional single-customer multi-exchanges, detected on a suitably defined customer improvement graph, and more innovative multicustomer multi-exchanges, detected on a facility improvement graph dynamically built through the use of a greedy scheme. Computational results for some benchmark instances are reported that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for solving large-scale problems. A further test on real data involving an Italian factory is also presented.

### Abstract:
The pooling problem, which is fundamental to the petroleum industry, describes a situation in which products possessing different attribute qualities are mixed in a series of pools in such a way that the attribute qualities of the blended products of the end pools must satisfy given requirements. It is well known that the pooling problem can be modeled through bilinear and nonconvex quadratic programming. In this paper, we investigate how best to apply a new branch-and-cut quadratic programming algorithm to solve the pooling problem. To this effect, we consider two standard models: One is based primarily on flow variables, and the other relies on the proportion of flows entering pools. A hybrid of these two models is proposed for general pooling problems. Comparison of the computational properties of flow and proportion models is made on several problem instances taken from the literature. Moreover, a simple alternating procedure and a variable neighborhood search heuristic are developed to solve large instances and compared with the well-known method of successive linear programming. Solution of difficult test problems from the literature is substantially accelerated, and larger ones are solved exactly or approximately.

## 6. Prognosis Using an Isotonic Prediction Technique
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
Outcome prediction based on historical data has been of practical and theoretical interest in many disciplines. A common type of outcome prediction is binary or discrete outcome prediction, as found in medical diagnosis and firm bankruptcy prediction. The prediction problem studied in this paper is outcome time prediction, or prognosis. Prognosis in medicine refers to a prediction of probable outcome of a disease for a patient. Patient data used as the basis for disease prognosis are usually censored because some of the patients have not experienced the outcome of the disease at the time of prognosis. A mathematical-programming approach, called isotonic prediction, is developed for the purpose of such prognosis tasks. The proposed technique is different from well-known statistical survival analysis methods, such as Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation and Cox's regression, in that it predicts individual patients' survival time frame. Two medical applications are presented to show the applicability of the proposed isotonic prediction technique.

## 7. A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Multistage Stochastic Integer Programming with Application to Stochastic Batch-Sizing Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
In this paper, we present a branch-and-price method to solve special structured multistage stochastic integer programming problems. We validate our method on two different versions of a multistage stochastic batch-sizing problem (SBSP). One version adopts a recourse formulation, and the other is based on probabilistic constraints. Our algorithmic approach is applicable to both formulations. Our computational results suggest that both classes of problems can be solved using relatively few nodes of a branch-and-price tree. The success of our approach calls for extensions in methodology as well as applications.

## 8. Tolerance Sensitivity and Optimality Bounds in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Wendell
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
Traditional sensitivity analysis in linear programming usually focuses on variations of one coefficient or term at a time. The tolerance approach was proposed to provide a decision maker with an effective and easy-to-use method to summarize the effects of simultaneous and independent changes in selected parameters. In particular, for variations of the objective function coefficients, the approach gives a maximum-tolerance percentage within which selected coefficients may vary from their estimated values (within a priori limits) while still retaining the same optimal basic feasible solution. Although an optimal solution may cease being optimal for variations beyond the maximum-tolerance percentage, it may still be close to optimal. Herein we characterize the potential loss of optimality for variations beyond the maximum-tolerance percentage as a maximum-regret function. We consider theoretical properties of this function and propose a method to compute a relevant portion of it.

## 9. Don't Fence Me In: Fragmented Markets for Technology and the Patent Acquisition Strategies of Firms
### Author(s):
- Rosemarie Ham Ziedonis
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
How do firms avoid being “fenced in” by owners of patented technologies used, perhaps unknowingly, in the design or manufacture of their products? This paper examines the conditions under which firms expand their own portfolios of patents in response to potential hold-up problems in markets for technology. Combining insights from transactions cost theory with recent scholarship on intellectual property and its exchange, I predict firms will patent more aggressively than otherwise expected when markets for technology are highly fragmented (i.e., ownership rights to external technologies are widely distributed); this effect should be more pronounced for firms with large investments in technology-specific assets and under a strong legal appropriability regime. Although these characteristics of firms and their external environments have been highlighted in the theoretical literature, prior research has not explored the extent to which such factors interact to shape the patenting behavior of firms. To empirically test these hypotheses, I develop a citations-based “fragmentation index” and estimate the determinants of patenting for 67 U.S. semiconductor firms between 1980 and 1994. Accumulating exclusionary rights of their own may enable firms to safeguard their investments in new technologies while foregoing some of the costs and delays associated with ex ante contracting.

## 10. Knowledge Sourcing Effectiveness
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
Much of the knowledge management (KM) literature focuses on ways to increase the volume of knowledge available to employees, ensure its quality, and improve its accessibility. Such supply-side arguments are limited to the extent that they do not address the demand for knowledge within organizations. This paper takes a novel approach to understanding how access to others' knowledge produces benefits by studying the extent to which individuals intentionally access each other's expertise, experience, insights, and opinions, which we term knowledge sourcing. A general model of knowledge sourcing, including contextual and dispositional antecedents and learning outcomes, is proposed and validated using survey data from a global organization. Knowledge sourcing explains a significant proportion of individuals' learning outcomes, but the strength of this effect is moderated both by the strength of individuals' learning orientations and the degree to which they find their jobs to be intellectually demanding. For researchers, this study extends existing knowledge by proposing, testing, and validating a new way to understand an important KM issue in organizations. Practitioners can use these findings to evaluate existing KM efforts and better target future KM interventions towards those individuals most likely to benefit.

## 11. Do Scientists Pay to Be Scientists?
### Author(s):
- Scott Stern
### Published:
- 1 Jun 2004
### Abstract:
This paper explores the relationship between wages and the scientific orientation of R&D organizations. Firms that adopt a science-oriented research approach (i.e., “science”) allow their researchers to pursue and publish an individual research agenda. The adoption of science may be associated with a “taste” for science on the part of researchers (a preference effect) and/or as a “ticket of admission” to gain earlier access to scientific discoveries with commercial application (a productivity effect). These two effects differ in their impact on wages. Whereas the preference effect contributes to a negative compensating differential, the productivity effect may result in rent sharing. However, because science may be adopted by firms employing higher-quality researchers, cross-sectional evaluations of wages and science may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity. To overcome this bias, this paper introduces a novel empirical approach. Specifically, prior to accepting a given job, many scientists receive multiple job offers, allowing for the calculation of the wage-science relationship and controlling for differences in salary levels offered to individual researchers. Using a dataset composed of multiple job offers to postdoctoral biologists, the results suggest a negative relationship between wages and science. These findings are robust to restricting the sample to nonacademic job offers, but the findings depend critically on the inclusion of researcher fixed effects. Conditional on perceived ability, scientists do indeed pay to be scientists.
