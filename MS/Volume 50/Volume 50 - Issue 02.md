### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
This article is a review of work published in Management Science on the topics of technological innovation, product development, and entrepreneurship since the inception of the journal in 1954. We intend the article to serve two goals. First, we hope that it will be useful to doctoral students and researchers interested in understanding what questions have been addressed in Management Science in the area of innovation. Second, we hope that the article will be useful to sociologists of science who are interested in understanding how knowledge develops in a field. We organize the literature into 12 themes. We then describe some aggregate properties of the articles. In an online supplement, we present brief summaries of the 250 articles we have identified as falling in the domain of our department.

## 2. Collaborative Prototyping and the Pricing of Custom-Designed Products

### Abstract:
A major challenge in the creation of custom-designed products lies in the elicitation of customer needs. As customers are frequently unable to accurately articulate their needs, designers typically create one or several prototypes, which they then present to the customer. This process, which we call collaborative prototyping, allows both parties to anticipate the outcome of the design process. Prototypes have two advantages: They help the customer to evaluate the unknown customized product, and they guide both parties in the search for the ideal product specification. Collaborative prototyping involves two economic agents, with different information structures and different—and potentially conflicting—objective functions. This raises several interesting questions: how many prototypes should be built, who should pay for them, and how should they and the customized product be priced. We show that, depending on the design problem and the market characteristics, the designer should offer prototypes at a profit, at cost, or even for free.

## 3. Modularity and Innovation in Complex Systems

### Abstract:
The problem of designing, coordinating, and managing complex systems has been central to the management and organization literature. Recent writings have tended to offer modularity as at least a partial solution to this design problem. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of identifying what constitutes an appropriate modularization of a complex system. We develop a formal simulation model that allows us to carefully examine the dynamics of innovation and performance in complex systems. The model points to the trade-off between the destabilizing effects of overly refined modularization and the modest levels of search and a premature fixation on inferior designs that can result from excessive levels of integration. The analysis highlights an asymmetry in this trade-off, with excessively refined modules leading to cycling behavior and a lack of performance improvement. We discuss the implications of these arguments for product and organization design.

## 4. Knowledge Reuse for Innovation

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
This study was conducted to better understand the knowledge reuse process when radical innovation (e.g., experiments to prepare for human exploration of Mars) is expected. The research involved detailing the knowledge reuse process in six case studies varying in degree of innovation. Across the six cases, a six-stage reuse-for-innovation process was identified consisting of three major actions: reconceptualize the problem and approach, including deciding to search for others' ideas to reuse; search-and-evaluate others' ideas to reuse; and develop the selected idea. Findings include (1) the need for an insurmountable gap in performance to stimulate the decision to reuse others' knowledge; (2) the critical importance of an adapter to bridge the idea source and recipient; (3) three layers of search-and-evaluate activities in which the first layer of scanning to find ideas to reuse and the last layer of detailed analysis of ideas are bridged by a layer of brief evaluations of ideas assessing the presence (or absence) of targeted information about each idea; and (4) the differential use of metaknowledge about each idea to facilitate proceeding through each search-and-evaluate layer. In addition, reusers in the more (versus less) innovative cases redefined problems at the outset in nontraditional ways using analogies and extensions, rather than accepting the preexisting problem definition; used a substantially broader search strategy with a greater variety of search methods; and worked more closely with adapters during the latter stages of the reuse process.

## 5. Designing a Better Shopbot

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
A primary tool that consumers have for comparative shopping is the shopbot, which is short for shopping robot. These shopbots automatically search a large number of vendors for price and availability. Typically a shopbot searches a predefined set of vendors and reports all results, which can result in time-consuming searches that provide redundant or dominated alternatives. Our research demonstrates analytically how shopbot designs can be improved by developing a utility model of consumer purchasing behavior. This utility model considers the intrinsic value of the product and its attributes, the disutility from waiting, and the cognitive costs associated with evaluating the offers retrieved. We focus on the operational decisions made by the shopbot: which stores to search, how long to wait, and which offers to present to the user. To illustrate our model we calibrate the model to price and response time data collected at online bookstores over a six-month period. Using prior expectations about price and response time, we show how shopbots can substantially increase consumer utility by searching more intelligently and then selectively presenting offers.

## 6. Industry Risk and Market Integration

- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
Traditionally, integration has been studied at the country level. With increasing economic integration, industrial reorganization, and blurring of national boundaries (e.g., European Union (EU)), it is important to investigate global integration at the industry level. We argue that country-level integration (segmentation) does not preclude industry-level segmentation (integration). Indeed, our results suggest that a country is integrated with (segmented from) the world capital markets only if most of her industries are integrated (segmented). We also show that although global industry risk is small, it can be priced for certain industries. Industries that are priced differently from either the world or domestic markets represent incremental opportunities for international diversification.

## 7. The Allocation of Inventory Risk in a Supply Chain: Push, Pull, and Advance-Purchase Discount Contracts
### Author(s):
- Gérard P. Cachon
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
While every firm in a supply chain bears supply risk (the cost of insufficient supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price contracts, completely avoid inventory risk (the cost of unsold inventory). With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain's inventory risk. A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain's inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain's profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of implementing coordinating contracts (i.e., contracts that achieve 100% efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinating contracts are compared against an inappropriate benchmark (often just a push contract). Furthermore, if firms also consider advance-purchase discounts, which are also simple to administer, then the coordination of the supply chain and the arbitrary allocation of its profit is possible. Several limitations of advance-purchase discounts are discussed.

## 8. Closed-Loop Supply Chain Models with Product Remanufacturing

### Abstract:
The importance of remanufacturing used products into new ones has been widely recognized in the literature and in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of choosing the appropriate reverse channel structure for the collection of used products from customers. Specifically, we consider a manufacturer who has three options for collecting such products: (1) she can collect them herself directly from the customers, (2) she can provide suitable incentives to an existing retailer (who already has a distribution channel) to induce the collection, or (3) she can subcontract the collection activity to a third party. Based on our observations in the industry, we model the three options described above as decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. When considering decentralized channels, we find that ceteris paribus, the agent, who is closer to the customer (i.e., the retailer), is the most effective undertaker of product collection activity for the manufacturer. In addition, we show that simple coordination mechanisms can be designed such that the collection effort of the retailer and the supply chain profits are attained at the same level as in a centrally coordinated system.

## 9. Ordering and Inventory Policies for Step Changes in the Unit Item Cost: A Discounted Cash Flow Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of determining the optimal ordering quantities of a purchased item where there are step changes in price, either up or down. Other costs incurred include ordering costs associated with each replenishment and holding costs related to capital tied up in inventory and physical stock holding. The net present value (NPV) principle is applied. Explicit expressions for the development of the optimal order quantities over time are presented. It is shown that three cases may be distinguished: (i) when the price change is very small, (ii) when an essential price increase occurs, and (iii) when there is an essential price decrease. Although the optimal last-order quantity before a price increase is similar in magnitude to what has been presented in other articles applying average cost approaches, in certain respects, this paper offers novel results contradictory to those suggested by other authors. Analysis shows that the average-cost model solutions are first-order approximations in the discount rate. Numerical evaluations of a range of price increases and times to the price increase suggest that, with certain important caveats, the average-cost formulae are likely to be acceptable for most practical situations for the infinite horizon situation.

## 10. Multiperson Tournaments: An Experimental Examination
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2004
### Abstract:
Modern hierarchical organizations, like corporations, must motivate agents to work hard. Given their pyramid structure, it is not surprising that one commonly used motivator is the promotion tournament. In such tournaments, agents compete to advance to positions at higher organizational levels. Though these tournaments are common, little research has empirically looked at the interface of organizational structure and tournament design. This paper aims to take a step in filling this void by comparing the performance of various tournament designs using controlled laboratory techniques.
