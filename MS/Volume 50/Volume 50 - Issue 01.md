### Abstract:
This issue marks the start of the 50th volume of Management Science. As is customary on such “round number” occasions, we will be taking time for a bit of retrospective review and soul-searching speculation. We begin here with an overall assessment of the journal's performance relative to its original mission. In subsequent articles, which will appear in issues throughout Volume 50, we will take more detailed disciplinary looks at the past, present, and future of Management Science and the management subfields it represents.

### Abstract:
Operations and Supply Chains is the current title for a department that has evolved through several different titles in recent years, reflecting its evolving mission from a focus on classical operations research at the time of ORSA's founding 50 years ago toward an embrace of a broader body of theory. Throughout this evolution, the focus on applied problems and the goal of improving practice through the development of suitable theory has remained constant

## 3. Revenue Management Under a General Discrete Choice Model of Consumer Behavior

### Abstract:
Customer choice behavior, such as buy-up and buy-down, is an important phenomenon in a wide range of revenue management contexts. Yet most revenue management methodologies ignore this phenomenon—or at best approximate it in a heuristic way. In this paper, we provide an exact and quite general analysis of this problem. Specifically, we analyze a single-leg reserve management problem in which the buyers' choice behavior is modeled explicitly. The choice model is very general, simply specifying the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered. The control problem is to decide which subset of fare products to offer at each point in time. We show that the optimal policy for this problem has a quite simple form. Namely, it consists of identifying an ordered family of “efficient“ subsets S1, …, Sm, and at each point in time opening one of these sets Sk, where the optimal index k is increasing in the remaining capacity x and decreasing in the remaining time. That is, the more capacity (or less time) available, the further the optimal set is along this sequence. We also show that the optimal policy is a nested allocation policy if and only if the sequence of efficient sets is nested, that is S1 ⊆ S2 ⊆ … ⊆Sm. Moreover, we give a characterization of when nesting by fare order is optimal. We also develop an estimation procedure for this setting based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method that jointly estimates arrival rates and choice model parameters when no-purchase outcomes are unobservable. Numerical results are given to illustrate both the model and estimation procedure.

## 4. Channel Performance Under Consignment Contract with Revenue Sharing

- 1 Jan 2004
### Abstract:
Under a consignment contract with revenue sharing, a supplier decides on the retail price and delivery quantity for his product, and retains ownership of the goods; for each item sold, the retailer deducts a percentage from the selling price and remits the balance to the supplier. In this paper we show that, under such a contract, both the overall channel performance and the performance of individual firms depend critically on demand price elasticity and on the retailer's share of channel cost. In particular, the (expected) channel profit loss, compared with that of a centralized system, increases with demand price elasticity and decreases with retailer's cost share, while the profit share extracted by the retailer decreases with price elasticity and increases with retailer's cost share. With an iso-price-elastic demand model, we show that the channel profit loss cannot exceed 26.4%, and that the retailer's profit share cannot be below 50%. When price elasticity is low, or when the retailer's cost share approaches 100%, or both, the retailer can extract nearly all the channel profit that is almost equal to the centralized channel profit.

## 5. Coordinating Contracts for Decentralized Supply Chains with Retailer Promotional Effort
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2004
### Abstract:
In this paper, a risk-neutral manufacturer sells a single product to a risk-neutral retailer. The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits. Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand), but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product. Other model extensions are also discussed.

## 6. Supply Contracts, Profit Sharing, Switching, and Reaction Options
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2004
### Abstract:
A common theme in the studies of flexible supply contracts has been the producer's profit-maximization problem without regard to the suppliers' reactions. However, suppliers do react and protect their downside against producer's operating policies by revising their strategies in a manner consistent with their profitmaximization objectives. This fact motivates our work. Using a real-options (contingent claims) approach, we analyze and value supply contracts in a setting characterized by exchange rate uncertainty, supplier-switching options, order-quantity flexibility, profit sharing, and supplier reaction options. We also use basic diversification concepts, from portfolio theory, to analyze risk reduction in a unique framework. Given this setup, we explicitly model how flexibility can be mutually beneficial to both the producer and the suppliers. Using this model, we concurrently solve and examine the dual optimization problem for the suppliers and the producer. Our approach also endogenizes the extent and degree of profit sharing through the resulting optimal policies. We also analyze what induces the producer and the suppliers to accept flexibility in their contracts.

## 7. Benefits of Skill Chaining in Serial Production Lines with Cross-Trained Workers

### Abstract:
To gain insight into the potential logistical benefits of worker cross-training and agile workforce policies, we study simple models of serial production systems with flexible servers operating under a constant work-in-process (CONWIP) release policy. Two important and interrelated issues are: (a) how to decide which skill(s) are strategically most desirable for workers to gain, and (b) how to coordinate these workers to respond dynamically to congestion. We address these by considering two cross-training strategies: a straightforward capacity-balancing approach, which we call cherry picking (CP), and an innovative overlapping zone strategy that we call skill chaining. Our comparison shows that skill-chaining strategies have the potential to be robust and efficient methods for implementing workforce agility in serial production lines.

## 8. Joint Inventory Replenishment and Component Allocation Optimization in an Assemble-to-Order System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2004
### Abstract:
This paper considers a multicomponent, multiproduct periodic-review assemble-to-order (ATO) system that uses an independent base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. Product demands in each period are integer-valued correlated random variables, with each product being assembled from multiple units of a subset of components. The system quotes a prespecified response time window for each product and receives a reward if the demand for that product is filled within its response time window. We formulate a two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse to determine the optimal base-stock policy and the optimal component allocation policy for the ATO system. We show that the component allocation problem is a general multidimensional knapsack problem (MDKP) and is NP-hard. We propose a simple, order-based component allocation rule and show that it can be solved in either polynomial or pseudopolynomial time. We also use the sample average approximation method to determine the optimal base-stock levels and compare it with two variations of the equal fractile heuristic. Intensive testing indicates that our solution method for each stage of the stochastic program is robust, effective, and that it significantly outperforms existing methods. Finally, we discuss several managerial implications of our findings.

## 9. Metaheuristics with Local Search Techniques for Retail Shelf-Space Optimization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2004
### Abstract:
Efficient shelf-space allocation can provide retailers with a competitive edge. While there has been little study on this subject, there is great interest in improving product allocation in the retail industry. This paper examines a practicable linear allocation model for optimizing shelf-space allocation. It extends the model to address other requirements such as product groupings and nonlinear profit functions. Besides providing a network flow solution, we put forward a strategy that combines a strong local search with a metaheuristic approach to space allocation. This strategy is flexible and efficient, as it can address both linear and nonlinear problems of realistic size while achieving near-optimal solutions through easily implemented algorithms in reasonable timescales. It offers retailers opportunities for more efficient and profitable shelf management, as well as higher-quality planograms.
