### Abstract:
The use of H-1B and other work visas to hire foreign information technology (IT) professionals in the United States has attracted significant controversy and policy debates. On one hand, hiring high-skill foreign IT professionals on work visas can be advantageous for U.S. firms and the overall economy. On the other hand, high-skill immigration can adversely impact the wages of foreign and American IT professionals. This study uses data on skills and compensation of more than 50,000 IT professionals in the United States over the period 2000–2005 to study patterns in compensation of foreign and American IT professionals to inform these debates. Contrary to the popular belief that foreign workers are a cheap source of labor for U.S. firms, we find that after controlling for their human capital attributes, foreign IT professionals (those without U.S. citizenship and those with H-1B or other work visas) earn a salary premium when compared with IT professionals with U.S. citizenship. The salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and for those on work visas fluctuate in response to supply shocks created by the annual caps on new H-1B visas. Setting lower and fully utilized annual caps results in higher salary premiums for non-U.S. citizens and those with work visas. We discuss implications of this study for crafting informed visa- and immigration-related policies by the U.S. government, for staffing practices of firms, and for human capital investments by IT professionals.

### Abstract:
Retail store managers may not follow order advices generated by an automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives differ from the cost-minimization objective of the system or if they perceive the system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior, investigate their potential drivers, and thereby devise a method to improve automated replenishment systems. Using orders, shipments, and point-of-sale data for 19,417 item–store combinations over five stores, we show that (i) store managers consistently modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to nonpeak days, and (ii) this behavior is explained significantly by product characteristics such as case pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our regression results suggest that store managers improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. Based on these results, we construct a method to modify automated order advices by learning from the behavior of store managers. Motivated by the management coefficients theory, our method is efficient to implement and outperforms store managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory.

## 4. Reality Check: Combining Choice Experiments with Market Data to Estimate the Importance of Product Attributes

### Abstract:
Discrete choice models estimated using hypothetical choices made in a survey setting (i.e., choice experiments) are widely used to estimate the importance of product attributes in order to make product design and marketing mix decisions. Choice experiments allow the researcher to estimate preferences for product features that do not yet exist in the market. However, parameters estimated from experimental data often show marked inconsistencies with those inferred from the market, reducing their usefulness in forecasting and decision making. We propose an approach for combining choice-based conjoint data with individual-level purchase data to produce estimates that are more consistent with the market. Unlike prior approaches for calibrating conjoint models so that they correctly predict aggregate market shares for a “baseline” market, the proposed approach is designed to produce parameters that are more consistent with those that can be inferred from individual-level market data.

## 5. Dynamic Programming Models and Algorithms for the Mutual Fund Cash Balance Problem
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Fund managers have to decide the amount of a fund's assets that should be kept in cash, considering the trade-off between being able to meet shareholder redemptions and minimizing the opportunity cost from lost investment opportunities. In addition, they have to consider redemptions by individuals as well as institutional investors, the current performance of the stock market and interest rates, and the pattern of investments and redemptions that are correlated with market performance. We formulate the problem as a dynamic program, but this encounters the classic curse of dimensionality. To overcome this problem, we propose a provably convergent approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We also adapt the algorithm to an online environment, requiring no knowledge of the probability distributions for rates of return and interest rates. We use actual data for market performance and interest rates, and demonstrate the quality of the solution (compared to the optimal) for the top 10 mutual funds in each of nine fund categories. We show that our results closely match the optimal solution (in considerably less time), and outperform two static (newsvendor) models. The result is a simple policy that describes when money should be moved into and out of cash based on market performance.

## 6. Valuing Money and Things: Why a $20 Item Can Be Worth More and Less Than $20

### Abstract:
The study of risky decision making has long used monetary gambles to study choice, but many everyday decisions do not involve the prospect of winning or losing money. Monetary gambles, as it turns out, may be processed and evaluated differently than gambles with nonmonetary outcomes. Whereas monetary gambles involve numeric amounts that can be straightforwardly combined with probabilities to yield at least an approximate “expectation” of value, nonmonetary outcomes are typically not numeric and do not lend themselves to easy combination with the associated probabilities. Compared with monetary gambles, the evaluation of nonmonetary prospects typically proves less sensitive to changes in the probability range (inside the extremes of certainty and impossibility), which, among other things, can yield preference reversals. Generalizing on earlier work that attributed similar findings to the role of affect in the evaluation process (Rottenstreich, Y., C. K. Hsee. 2001. Money, kisses, and electric shocks: An affective psychology of risk. Psych. Sci.12(3) 185–190), we attribute the observed patterns to a fundamental difference in the evaluation of monetary versus nonmonetary outcomes. Potential pitfalls in the use of monetary gambles to study choice are highlighted, and implications and future directions are discussed.

## 7. Hierarchical Structure and Search in Complex Organizations

### Abstract:
Organizations engage in search whenever they perform nonroutine tasks, such as the definition and validation of a new strategy, the acquisition of new capabilities, or new product development. Previous work on search and organizational hierarchy has discovered that a hierarchy with a central decision maker at the top can speed up problem solving, but possibly at the cost of solution quality compared with results of a decentralized search. Our study uses a formal model and simulations to explore the effect of an organizational hierarchy on solution stability, solution quality, and search speed. Three insights arise on how a hierarchy can improve organizational search: (1) assigning a lead function that “anchors” a solution speeds up problem solving; (2) local solution choice should be delegated to the lowest level; and (3) structure matters little at the middle management level, but it matters at the front line; front-line groups should be kept small. These results highlight the importance for every organization of adapting its hierarchical structure to its search requirements.

## 8. Contracting for Collaborative Services

### Published:

### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze the contracting issues that arise in collaborative services, such as consulting, financial planning, and information technology outsourcing. In particular, we investigate how the choice of contract type—among fixed-fee, time-and-materials, and performance-based contracts—is driven by the service environment characteristics. We find that fixed-fee contracts contingent on performance are preferred when the service output is more sensitive to the vendor's effort, that time-and-materials contracts are optimal when the output is more sensitive to the buyer's effort, and that performance-based contracts dominate when the output is equally sensitive to both the buyer's and the vendor's inputs. We also discuss how the performance of these contracts is affected with output uncertainty, process improvement opportunities, and the involvement of multiple buyers and vendors in the joint-production process. Our model highlights the trade-offs underlying the choice of contracts in a collaborative service environment and identifies service process design changes that improve contract efficiency.

## 9. Optimal Windows for Aggregating Ratings in Electronic Marketplaces
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Mar 2010
### Abstract:
Aseller in an online marketplace with an effective reputation mechanism should expect that dishonest behavior results in higher payments now whereas honest behavior results in a better reputation—and thus higher payments—in the future. We study the Window Aggregation Mechanism, a widely used class of mechanisms that shows the average value of the seller's ratings within some fixed window of past transactions. We suggest approaches for choosing the window size that maximizes the range of parameters for which it is optimal for the seller to be truthful. We show that mechanisms that use information from a larger number of past transactions tend to provide incentives for patient sellers to be more truthful but for higher-quality sellers to be less truthful.

## 10. Markets for Inventors: Learning-by-Hiring as a Driver of Mobility
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Mar 2010
### Abstract:
Hiring away inventors has long been recognized as a way of learning used by innovative firms. This paper claims that the characteristics of the knowledge accumulated by an inventor at his current employer affect what hiring firms can learn from him. The implication is that some inventors are more likely to be hired away than their coworkers. We analyze the relationship between the type of knowledge embodied by inventors working at IBM and their probability of moving. Relying on patent data to track the movement of inventors across firms and to characterize the kind of know-how they hold, we identify the following drivers of inventor mobility: the quality of their work; the complementarity of their knowledge with that of other inventors; and, to a lower extent, their expertise in the firm's core areas in which the firm is not a dominant player. Results confirm the role of knowledge characteristics behind the mobility of research and development personnel and suggest that learning is a relevant force in the market for inventors.

## 11. On the Optimal Product Line Selection Problem with Price Discrimination
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Mar 2010
### Abstract:
Product line design decisions are determinant for a firm's market success and, simultaneously, very costly to implement and change. To evaluate the profitability of a design, a number of mathematical programming approaches have been proposed in the last three decades—typically nonlinear integer optimization problems that can only be tackled heuristically for real-world instances. Recently, Chen and Hausman (2000) efficiently exploited the fractional programming properties of a stylized model for product line and price selection with the objective to maximize contribution given homogeneous customer behavior by an aggregate multinomial logit choice model. We extend the approach of Chen and Hausman (Chen, K. D., W. H. Hausman. 2000. Technical note: Mathematical properties of the optimal product line selection problem using choice-based conjoint analysis. Management Sci.46(2) 327–332) to determine an optimal product line under a personalized or group pricing strategy in markets with multiple heterogeneous consumers such that total profit (including fixed costs) is maximized. Personalized/group pricing is a growing discrimination strategy that more and more businesses are realizing is not only very profitable, but also often implementable in the era of e-business. Our problem formulation allows to incorporate commonly applied attraction choice models including the multinomial logit, the Bradley–Terry–Luce, and approximately the first choice model. Though the problem is generally nonlinear, we show that the fractional substructure resulting from attraction choice models can still be exploited to globally solve real-world instances in reasonable time.
