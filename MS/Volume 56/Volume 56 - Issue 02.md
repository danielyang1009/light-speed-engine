### Abstract:
To mitigate the threat that terrorists smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the United States through maritime containers, the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspects containers upon entry to domestic ports. Inspection-driven congestion is costly, and CBP provides incentives to firms to improve security upstream in the supply chain, thereby reducing the inspection burden at U.S. ports. We perform an economic analysis of this incentive program, called Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), modeling in a game-theoretic framework the strategic interaction between CBP, trading firms, and terrorists. Our equilibrium results highlight the possibility that a properly run program can efficiently shift some of CBP's security burden to private industry. These results also suggest that CBP may have the opportunity to use strategic delay as an incentive for firms to join. Analysis of comparative statics shows that, with increasing capacity, membership in C-TPAT systematically declines.

### Abstract:
In addition to the wireless telephony boom, a similar exponentially increasing trend in wireless data service—for example, short message service (SMS)—is visible as technology advances. We develop a structural model to examine user demand for voice service and SMS. Specifically, we measure the own- and cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs and sequential discrete plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed individual consumption data of more than 6,000 customers, we find that SMS and voice service are small substitutes. A 10% increase in the price of voice minutes will induce about a 0.8% increase in the demand for SMS. The own-price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of approximately −0.1. Younger users' demand is far more inelastic than that of older users. We then conduct counterfactual policy experiments that fully capture the effects of changes in key parameters on the firm's revenues. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of our framework.

## 5. Hybrid Entrepreneurship

### Published:
- 6 Nov 2009
### Abstract:
In contrast to previous efforts to model an individual's movement from wage work into entrepreneurship, we consider that individuals might transition incrementally by retaining their wage job while entering into self-employment. We show that these hybrid entrepreneurs represent a significant share of all entrepreneurial activity. Theoretical arguments are proposed to suggest why hybrid entrants are distinct from self-employment entrants, and why hybrid entry may facilitate subsequent entry into full self-employment. We demonstrate that there are significant theoretical and empirical consequences for this group and our understanding of self-employment entry and labor market dynamics. Using matched employee–employer data over eight years, we test the model on a population of Swedish wage earners in the knowledge-intensive sector.

## 6. Managing Know-How
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Nov 2009
### Abstract:
We study how firms can use a knowledge management system to optimally leverage employee-generated know-how. In particular, we consider the following practical strategic questions for the manager of a knowledge-intensive firm: Should her firm develop a formal knowledge system? And if so, how should it be managed, particularly in terms of what information to record? We find that firms benefit more from a knowledge system when they are larger, face the same issues more frequently, have higher turnover, and face problems about which there is less general knowledge. In terms of what information to record, a key insight is that recording moderately successful practices can be counterproductive, because doing so may inefficiently reduce employees' incentives to experiment. This “strong-form competency trap” forces firms into an exploration–exploitation trade-off. Firms that value a knowledge system most should also be most selective in recording information. We further find that recording successes is more valuable than recording failures, which supports firms' focus on best practice. Beyond these main principles, we also show that it may be optimal to disseminate know-how on a plant level but not on a firm level, and that recording backup solutions is most valuable at medium levels of environmental change.

## 7. Predicting Utility Under Satiation and Habit Formation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Jan 2010
### Abstract:
We introduce a modification of the discounted utility model that accounts for both satiation and habit formation in intertemporal choice. Preferences depend on the satiation level and the habitual consumption level. These two state variables, together with the shape of the value function, drive the properties of the model. One unique feature of our model is that it addresses the trade-off between seeking variety and maintaining acquired habits. We examine several properties of our model, such as the nontrivial patterns of desirability (willingness to pay) for an additional unit of consumption, or the effect of abstaining from consumption (craving). We explore the shape of optimal consumption patterns in discrete and continuous choice settings. If subjects underestimate the changes in satiation and habituation levels, as occurs under projection bias, our model explains why people buy more when hungry, or prefer variety in advance of consumption but stay with the same consumption good in actual use.

## 8. Cross-Function and Same-Function Alliances: How Does Alliance Structure Affect the Behavior of Partnering Firms?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Nov 2009
### Abstract:
Firms collaborate to develop and deliver new products. These collaborations vary in terms of the similarity of the competencies that partnering firms bring to the alliance. In same-function alliances, partnering firms have similar competencies, whereas in cross-function alliances, partners have very different competencies. On examining managers' view of these alliances, we find that, on average, same-function alliances are expected to perform better than cross-function alliances, holding fixed the level of inputs. A game-theoretic analysis shows that this apprehension about cross-function alliances is consistent with a Pareto-inferior equilibrium. A Pareto-superior equilibrium, however, suggests that partners in cross-function alliances may invest more in their alliances than those in same-function alliances. It is also often believed that increasing the number of partnering firms is not conducive for collaborative effort. Our analysis shows that this belief is correct for same-function alliances, but not for cross-function alliances. We test these equilibrium predictions in an experiment where we exogenously vary the type of alliance and the number of partnering firms. The experimental results lend support for the Pareto-superior equilibrium. Partners in cross-function alliances invested more than their counterparts in same-function alliances, and this difference in investment levels increased with the number of partnering firms. We extend our model to consider alliances where firms have an opportunity to learn from their partners and later leverage this knowledge outside the scope of their alliance. Though such learning increases the resources committed by alliance partners in the learning phase, it decreases investment in the subsequent competition and also dampens the overall investment across the two stages. In addition, an increase in interalliance competition decreases investments in the focal alliance but increases investment in the competition outside the scope of the alliance.

## 9. Perturbation of Numerical Confidential Data via Skew-t Distributions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Dec 2009
### Abstract:
We propose a new data perturbation method for numerical database security problems based on skew-t distributions. Unlike the normal distribution, the more general class of skew-t distributions is a flexible parametric multivariate family that can model skewness and heavy tails in the data. Because databases having a normal distribution are seldom encountered in practice, the newly proposed approach, coined the skew-t data perturbation (STDP) method, is of great interest for database managers. We also discuss how to preserve the sample mean vector and sample covariance matrix exactly for any data perturbation method. We investigate the performance of the STDP method by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study and compare it with other existing perturbation methods. Of particular importance is the ability of STDP to reproduce characteristics of the joint tails of the distribution in order for database users to answer higher-level questions. We apply the STDP method to a medical database related to breast cancer.

## 10. Buyer Uncertainty and Two-Part Pricing: Theory and Applications
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Jan 2010
### Abstract:
We consider two-part pricing of a service offered to risk-averse buyers subject to demand uncertainty. Buyers subscribe to the contract before resolution of the uncertainty. Sellers set two-part prices that trade off between insuring buyers against the uncertainty and the ex post deadweight loss from inefficient usage. If marginal and total benefits from the service are positively correlated (a sufficient condition is that the uncertainty not directly affect the buyer benefit), the usage charge should be set above the marginal cost of the service. If marginal and total benefits are negatively correlated, the usage charge should be set below the marginal cost. These results apply whether the seller has market power or is subject to competition. The difference between the profit-maximizing usage charge and marginal cost increases with buyer risk aversion. Our results can be extended to the case of the seller being more risk averse than the buyers. We discuss applications to pricing of beach and ski resorts, lines of credit, utility computing, and government services.

## 11. Timing of RFID Adoption in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):
- Seungjin Whang
### Published:
- 30 Dec 2009
### Abstract:
This paper studies the incentives behind the adoption of radio-frequency identification (RFID) in a supply chain. One prominent feature of RFID technology is that once RFID tags are attached on the items at an upstream site, the same tags can be reused at its downstream sites at lower or zero variable cost. This creates an interesting, one-sided “free-rider” problem, where the downstream would wait to free-ride on the upstream's first move, but not vice versa. Using a stylized game-theoretic model, we characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Compared to the first-best solution, firms in equilibrium tend to adopt too late. We then study the dual benefits of technology coordination between the two firms and find that it would not only save redundant costs of putting tags, but also speed up the downstream's RFID adoption. We also show that the equal-cost-split arrangement shifts the benefit of free-riding to the upstream, thereby mitigating the negative impacts in many cases. But it may distort the market when it operates in the optimal manner. The general message of the model is that technology coordination and cost-split each contribute to the mitigation of the free-rider problem in RFID adoption.

## 12. The Interaction Effect of Rivalry Restraint and Competitive Advantage on Profit: Why the Whole Is Less Than the Sum of the Parts
### Author(s):
- Richard Makadok
### Published:
- 30 Dec 2009
### Abstract:
Rivalry-restraint-based theoretical mechanisms predict that an industry's profits will increase when its firms engage in less price competition, or less direct competition, with each other. Competitive-advantage-based theoretical mechanisms predict that a firm's profits will increase when it creates superior economic value that direct and indirect competitors cannot fully compete away. But what is the interaction effect on profit of simultaneously restraining rivalry and increasing competitive advantage? Do they positively amplify/reinforce each other, or negatively dampen/undermine each other? This paper's theoretical model predicts a negative interaction effect, with potentially significant implications for theory, practice, and pedagogy.

## 13. Divisor-Based Biproportional Apportionment in Electoral Systems: A Real-Life Benchmark Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Dec 2009
### Abstract:
Biproportional apportionment methods provide two-way proportionality in electoral systems where the electoral region is subdivided into electoral districts. The problem is to assign integral values to the elements of a matrix that are proportional to a given input matrix, and such that a set of row- and column-sum requirements are fulfilled. In a divisor-based method for biproportional apportionment, the problem is solved by computing appropriate row and column divisors, and by rounding the quotients. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of divisor-based biproportional apportionment in an electoral system context. By performing experiments on real-life benchmark instances (election data with multimember districts), we evaluate the general quality of divisor-based apportionments with respect to, e.g., deviation from quota, reversal orderings, and occurrences of ties. For example, we studied the frequency in which a party with a higher vote count in a district ended up with fewer seats in that district.
