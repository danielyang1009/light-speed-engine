## 1. Pricing Strategies in a Dynamic Duopoly: A Differential Game Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
We formulate a differential game model for dynamic pricing in a duopolistic market. Firms' demand functions are derived from utility maximizing behavior of consumers with the demand for a brand given by the logit model. Preferences for brands are assumed to evolve over time in the market in a manner akin to learning models postulated in the marketing literature. We derive the differential equations governing the equilibrium open-loop price paths over time and show that in steady state, the brand with the higher preference level charges the higher price. The formulation is extended to include the effects of consumer heterogeneity, and equilibrium steady-state prices are compared with those obtained when heterogeneity is ignored. A comparison of steady-state dynamic prices with myopic prices is provided. An empirical example is discussed to show how steady-state model predictions may be obtained from actual longitudinal purchase data.

## 2. Decision Quality Using Ranked Attribute Weights
### Author(s):
- F. Hutton Barron
- Bruce E. Barrett
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
Three published approximation formulae for selecting the best multiattribute alternative based on rank-ordered weights are evaluated. All formulae are surprisingly efficacious in determining the best multiattribute alternative. Rank order centroid (ROC) weights are more accurate than the other rank-based formulae; furthermore, the ROC formula generalizes to incorporate both other forms of partial information about attribute weights and partial rank order information as well. Because a ROC-based analysis is so straightforward and efficacious, it provides an appropriate implementation tool.

## 3. Repeated Optional Gambles and Risk Aversion
### Author(s):
- Christian Gollier
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
We analyze in this paper the effect of age on the optimal dynamic strategy toward repeated independent gambles. When deciding to accept or to reject a lottery that is offered today, the gambler knows how many lotteries can yet be played in the future. We first characterize the optimal dynamic strategy when future lotteries are identically distributed. We show that the existence of future lotteries always increases the willingness to gamble today. When the sequence of lotteries is independent but not identically distributed, we show that this does not need to be true. This analysis can be applied to the problem of investing in indivisible risky investment projects, or to the problem of dynamic optimal insurance demand.

## 4. Economic Models for Vendor Evaluation with Quality Cost Analysis
### Author(s):
- George Tagaras
- Hau L. Lee
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
Successful vendor-vendee relationship is viewed as an important ingredient for maintaining competitiveness in the current marketplace. This calls for a careful and comprehensive approach in selecting vendors. The cost of quality (or better phrased as the cost of unquality) resulted from imperfections of a vendor's incoming input materials is one component of the total costs in the evaluation of vendors. The purpose of this paper is to show that looking at only one dimension of the quality cost is not sufficient and to highlight the importance of having a high quality internal process. We explore the relationship between the vendor's quality cost, the vendor's input quality, and the imperfections of the manufacturing process. We analyze the properties of the resulting quality cost model, and draw managerial implications in the selection of vendors.

## 5. Heuristics for Multimachine Scheduling Problems with Earliness and Tardiness Costs
### Author(s):
- A. Federgruen
- G. Mosheiov
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
We consider multimachine scheduling problems with earliness and tardiness costs. We first, analyze problems in which the cost of a job is given by a general nondecreasing, convex function F of the absolute deviation of its completion time from a (common) unrestrictive due-date, and the objective is to minimize the sum of the costs incurred for all N jobs. (A special case to which considerable attention is given is the completion time variance problem.)

## 6. A Dual Ascent Procedure for Multiproduct Dynamic Demand Coordinated Replenishment with Backlogging
### Author(s):
- E. Powell Robinson, Jr.
- Li-Lian Gao
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
This paper describes a mixed-integer programming formulation and dual ascent based branch-and-bound algorithm for the multiproduct dynamic demand coordinated replenishment problem with backlogging. The single sourcing properties of the formulation and the hierarchical structure of the fixed-charge and continuous variables yield an extremely tight linear programming relaxation for the problem. A branch-and-bound algorithm based on Erlenkotter's dual ascent, dual adjustment, and primal construction concepts exploits these properties to obtain an efficient solution procedure. Computational results indicate that the new procedures find optimal solutions in less than five percent of the computational time of the most efficient previous algorithm. The heuristic performance of the procedures also demonstrate their superiority over existing approaches. We solved problems with 12 time periods and 20 products in 0.41 CPU seconds, and heuristic solutions with a worst-case three-percent optimality gap are found in 0.068 CPU seconds. The efficiency and large-scale capability of the procedures make their potential application in inventory requirements planning systems promising.

## 7. Parametric Solution for Linear Bicriteria Knapsack Models
### Author(s):
- Moshe Eben-Chaime
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
Linear weighing is a common approach to handle multiple criteria and the knapsack is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. A knapsack problem with two linearly weighted, objective criteria is considered in this paper. For better support, it is important to provide the decision maker with information that covers the whole range of alternatives. Toward this goal, an algorithm for the construction of a parametric solution to the problem, i.e., for any combination of weights, is developed, which is based on finding a longest path in a network which compactly represents all feasible solutions to the knapsack problem. Exploiting the special structure of the knapsack model, the algorithm efficiently constructs the parametric solution in time that is linear in the product of the number of variables, the resource limit (right-hand side of the constraint), and the (finite) number of vectors which constitute the solution. The amount of memory required is linear in the product of the number of variables and the resource limit. Results of computational study are reported. The results are used to assess the efficiency of the algorithm and characterize its behavior with respect to the parameter values.

## 8. An Empirical Analysis of the Product-Process Matrix
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
Process choice, a major part of operations strategy, is a key decision that links operations to business strategy. Hayes and Wheelwright, among others, argue that the emphasis given to product customization and other competitive priorities should agree with process choice. Our empirical study investigates whether firms actually link their process choice to product customization and other competitive priorities as hypothesized, and whether compatible decision patterns lead to better performance. Analysis of data collected from managers at 144 U.S. manufacturing plants shows a strong correlation between process choice, product customization, and competitive priorities. Process choice is highly related with the degree of product customization, and also with the emphasis placed on the quality and cost competitive priorities. Job shops and batch shops tend to have more product customization, higher costs, and higher quality. Some continuous flow shops use part commonality and flexible automation to achieve more customization than would otherwise be expected. Without these initiatives, customization in continuous flow shops results in weak performance.

## 9. Context and Antecedents of Information Utility at the R&D/Marketing Interface
### Author(s):
- Rudy K. Moenaert
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
The objective of the present study was to develop a comprehensive empirically-based model of the communication interface between R&D and marketing. Following Moenaert and Souder (Moenaert, R. K., Souder, W. E. 1990. An analysis of the use of extra-functional information by marketing and R&D personnel review and model. Product Innovation Management7(3, September) 213229.), a causal model of the antecedents of information utility at the R&D/marketing-interface was postulated. A non-experimental critical incident method was used to test the model. The field survey involved 386 team members of 80 new product innovation teams in 40 companies. Path analysis was used to test the causal model. Support for several aspects of the model were found. First, the relevance and the credibility of the message had strong effects on the perception of information utility. The comprehensibility of the message had a moderate effect on the perception of information utility, whereas novelty had a small effect. Second, the quality of the relationship, the seniority and the prior experience of the message source, and the type of communication channel used had significant effects on the perception of the message. The implications of the research results for managers and researchers are detailed.

## 10. Bottleneck Resource Allocation in Manufacturing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1996
### Abstract:
Many resource-allocation problems in manufacturing and service operations require selecting integer-valued levels for various activities that consume nondecreasing amounts of limited resources. System productivity, to be maximized, is limited by the least productive (bottleneck) activity. We first review a basic bisection method that can solve this discrete, monotonic resource-allocation problem even with a nonlinear objective and constraints. We then generalize the basic algorithm to solve an enhanced version of the problem containing additional coupling constraints on the allocation decisions. This generalization applies to assembly-release planning (ARP) in a multiproduct assemble-to-forecast environment with part commonality. The ARP problem requires deciding the number of kits for each product to release for assembly in every time period, using the available parts, to achieve if possible the target service levels for all products and time periods or minimize the maximum deviation of the actual service levels from the targets. We also consider extensions of the ARP model incorporating precedence constraints and part substitutability, and show how to modify the bisection method to solve these problems.
