### Abstract:
We consider a multiserver service system with general nonstationary arrival and service-time processes in which s(t), the number of servers as a function of time, needs to be selected to meet projected loads. We try to choose s(t) so that the probability of a delay (before beginning service) hits or falls just below a target probability at all times. We develop an approximate procedure based on a time-dependent normal distribution, where the mean and variance are determined by infinite-server approximations. We demonstrate that this approximation is effective by making comparisons with the exact numerical solution of the Markovian Mt/M/st model.

## 2. A Branch and Bound Procedure for the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Discounted Cash Flows
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
Management of projects is complicated by the scarcity of resources required to execute them. Limited resources usually extend the project completion times beyond those determined by CPM/PERT. Several solution procedures have been developed for solving the resource constrained project scheduling problem. One objective commonly used for these problems is to complete the project as early as possible (minimize makespan). The problem considered in this paper is a resource constrained project scheduling problem, with the added features that there are cash flows associated with the project activities, and the objective is to schedule the project activities in such a way that the net present value of cash flows is maximized. With these features the problem becomes financially motivated and more realistic.

## 3. Inventory Control with Information About Supply Conditions
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
This paper presents an inventory-control model which includes a Markovian model of the supply system. As that system evolves over time, so do the replenishment leadtimes. The optimal policy has the same structure as in standard models, but its parameters change dynamically to reflect current supply conditions. In this setting, contrary to conventional wisdom, a longer leadtime does not necessarily imply more inventory. The leadtime is important, but so is a concept we call order coverage.

## 4. Maximum Entropy Aggregation of Expert Predictions

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
This paper presents a maximum entropy framework for the aggregation of expert opinions where the expert opinions concern the prediction of the outcome of an uncertain event. The event to be predicted and individual predictions rendered are assumed to be discrete random variables. A measure of expert competence is defined using a distance metric between the actual outcome of the event and each expert's predicted outcome. Following Levy and Delic (Levy, W. B., H. Delic. 1994. Maximum entropy aggregation of individual opinions. IEEE Trans. Sys. Man & Cybernetics24 606613.), we use Shannon's information measure (Shannon [Shannon, C. E. 1948. A mathematical theory of communication. Bell Syst. Tech. J.27 379423.], Jaynes [Jaynes, E. T. 1957. Information theory and statistical mechanics. Phys. Rev.106 Part I: 620630, 108 Part II: 171190.]) to derive aggregation rules for combining two or more expert predictions into a single aggregated prediction that appropriately calibrates different degrees of expert competence and reflects any dependence that may exist among the expert predictions. The resulting maximum entropy aggregated prediction is least prejudiced in the sense that it utilizes all information available but remains maximally non committal with regard to information not available. Numerical examples to illuminate the implications of maximum entropy aggregation are also presented.

## 5. An Information Model Based on Classification Theory
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey Parsons
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
This paper develops a formal information structuring model based on the premise that an information system represents knowledge about things in an organization. Since humans organize knowledge about things via categories or classes, the model is motivated by a theory of classification. The theory suggests several critical elements of classification based on the importance of classifying things to human survival. These elements are reflected by constructs in the model. Formal implications of the model for systems development are derived and strategies proposed for empirically evaluating these implications with respect to current modeling approaches. Necessary conditions are identified for a collection of classes to be considered a good model of some domain. The conditions permit different users to classify the same objects in different ways, depending on need. This suggests a new approach to data or object modeling which emphasizes instances and properties, rather than fixed categories of data or schemas. The model also offers insights into the role of classification in object-oriented analysis and, design methodologies. Finally, a program of research is outlined in which the model is being used to develop and experimentally evaluate an information modeling methodology, and as a source of implementation primitives for instance-based data modeling.

## 6. Quota-Based Compensation Plans for Multiterritory Heterogeneous Salesforces
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
We compare quota-based salesforce compensation plans with the BLSS plan, i.e., the optimal curvilinear agency-theory-based compensation plans proposed in Basu, Lal, Srinivasan and Staelin (Basu, A. K., R. Lal, V. Srinivasan, R. Staelin. 1985. Salesforce compensation plans: An agency theoretic perspective. Marketing Sci.4(Fall) 267291.). A quota plan pays a fixed salary which is supplemented by commission income that is a prespecified fraction of the dollar sales that exceed the quota. For a salesforce comprised of multiple salespersons/territories, we consider a basic quota plan where the commission rate and salary remain the same across salespersons; however, quotas vary across salespersons/territories. Compared to the BLSS plan that is individually tailored to each salesperson/territory, the basic quota plan's total nonoptimality in profit has two components: (i) a shapeinduced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the quota-based plan does not have the same optimal shape as the curvilinear BLSS plan, and (ii) a heterogeneity-induced nonoptimality arising from the fact that the salary and commission rate in the basic quota plan are constrained to be the same across the salesforce. Our numerical experiments indicate that the total nonoptimality is merely about 1% for the parametric scenarios studied. The basic quota plan is simpler to implement than the BLSS plan. Furthermore, changes in business conditions in a territory, or the transfer of a salesperson from one territory to another, can be accommodated by changing only the quota, without having to change the salary and the commission rate structure. Such advantages, together with our result that the nonoptimality is slight, suggest that quota-based plans offer considerable potential as a salesforce compensation scheme.

## 7. Bidding in Common Value Auctions: How the Commercial Construction Industry Corrects for the Winner's Curse
### Author(s):

- John H. Kagel
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
Experienced construction industry executives suffer from a winner's curse in laboratory common value auction markets (Dyer et al. [Dyer, D., J. H. Kagel, D. Levin. 1989. A comparison of naive and experienced bidders in common value offer auctions: Laboratory analysis. Econom. J.99 108115.]). This paper identifies essential differences between field environments and the economic theory underlying the laboratory markets that account for the executives' success in the field and a winner's curse in the lab. These are (1) industry-specific mechanisms which enable contractors to escape the winner's curse even when they bid too low, (2) learned, industry-specific evaluative processes which enable experienced contractors to avoid the winner's curse in the first place, and (3) important private value elements that underlie bidding. Also identified are a number of industry-specific bidding characteristics whose evolution can be explained using modern auction theory. Lessons are drawn regarding the use of experimental methods in economics.

## 8. Two Models for Assessing a Federal Environmental Health Policy: The Case of Radon in U.S. Homes
### Author(s):
- Michael D. Peterson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1996
### Abstract:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) strategy for reducing the public health risks of radon exposure depends largely on convincing the public to undertake testing and mitigation. In this context, important questions arise as to whether public response is likely to be high and thus whether changes in mortality are likely to be substantial. To explore these questions, we develop two models of the demographics of radon exposure in the United States. The first of these explores the sensitivity of projected mortality over the next 100 years to important policy variables such as testing and mitigation rates. The second model takes the analysis down to the level of the individual and estimates the distribution of risk across the population and the costs and benefits of mitigation accruing to a person who may change residence several times during his or her life. Our results show that realistic policy scenarios lead to moderate changes in mortality and that the cost-benefit calculation of the individual is unlikely to lead to high levels of public response. The results support the idea of a more focused public policy.
