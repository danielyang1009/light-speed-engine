## 1. Optimal Pricing and Lot-Sizing Under Conditions of Perishability and Partial Backordering
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
We formulate a generalized model of dynamic pricing and lot-sizing by a reseller who sells a perishable good. We assume that when it is economic to backlog demand, the reseller can plan for periods of shortage during which demand can be partially backordered. When the good is highly perishable, the reseller may need to backlog demand in order to market the good at a reasonable price. We present a simple solution procedure for solving the optimization problem. The procedure entails solving first a single nonlinear equation and then, if required, two nonlinear equations.

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
Product design is increasingly recognized as a critical activity that has a significant impact on the performance of firms. Consequently, when firms undertake a new (existing) product design (redesign) activity, it is important to employ techniques that will generate optimal solutions. As optimal product design using conjoint analysis data is an NP-hard problem, heuristic techniques for its solution have been proposed. This research proposes the use of and evaluates the performance of Genetic Algorithms (GA), which is based on the principles of natural selection, as an alternative procedure for generating good (i.e., close to optimal) solutions for the product design problem. The paper focuses on (1) how GA can be applied to the product design problems, (2) determining the comparative performance of GA vis--vis the dynamic programming (DP) heuristic (Kohli and Krishnamurti [Kohli, R., R. Krishnamurti. 1987. A heuristic approach to product design. Management Sci.33(12) 15231533.], [Kohli, R., R. Krishnamurti. 1989. Optimal product design using conjoint analysis: Computational complexity and algorithms. Eur. J. Oper. Res.40 186195.]) in generating solutions to the product design problems, (3) the sensitivity of the GA solutions to variations in parameter choices, and (4) generalizing the results of the dynamic programming heuristic to product designs involving attributes with varying number of levels and studying the impact of alternate attribute sequencing rules.

## 3. A Reference Lottery Metric for Valuing Health
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
This study utilizes reference lotteries on life and death to establish a death-equivalent metric for valuing long-term health effects. We use a computer-based survey approach to elicit choices among residential locations that pose different risks of chronic disease and dying in an automobile accident. From paired choices between different locations, we infer their rates of trade-off between reducing the risks of chronic diseases and the automobile death risk. The values of reducing the risks from two diseases, a nerve disease (peripheral neuropathy) and lymphoma (cancer of the lymph system), are measured in terms of both trade-off rates with the risk of an automobile death and with dollars.

## 4. Eliciting von Neumann-Morgenstern Utilities When Probabilities Are Distorted or Unknown
### Author(s):
- Peter Wakker
- Daniel Deneffe
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new method, the (gamble-)tradeoff method, for eliciting utilities in decision under risk or uncertainty. The elicitation of utilities, to be used in the expected utility criterion, turns out to be possible even if probabilities are ambiguous or unknown. A disadvantage of the tradeoff method is that a few more questions usually must be asked to clients. Also, the lotteries that are needed are somewhat more complex than in the certainty-equivalent method or in the probability-equivalent method. The major advantage of the tradeoff method is its robustness against probability distortions and misconceptions, which constitute a major cause of violations of expected utility and generate inconsistencies in utility elicitation. Thus the tradeoff method retains full validity under prospect theory, rank-dependent utility, and the combination of the two, i.e., cumulative prospect theory.

## 5. Self-Buffering, Self-Balancing, Self-Flushing Production Lines
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
This research addresses a system of flexible worker assignments in a setting where there are more workers than machines. When organized using this system, a production line balances itself by shifting the workloads continuously and automatically in response to changes in the state of the system. The system is, in effect, buffering itself against variation by altering the work assignments on the fly. This allows the system to operate with very low levels of work-in-process inventory (WIP).

## 6. Single-Machine Scheduling with Release Dates, Due Dates and Family Setup Times
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
We address the NP-hard problem of scheduling n independent jobs with release dates, due dates, and family setup times on a single machine to minimize the maximum lateness. This problem arises from the constant tug-of-war going on in manufacturing between efficient production and delivery performance, between maximizing machine utilization by batching similar jobs and maximizing customers' satisfaction by completing jobs before their due dates. We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm, and our computational results show that it solves almost all instances with up to about 40 jobs to optimality. The main algorithmic contribution is our lower bounding strategy to deal with family setup times. The key idea is to see a setup time as a setup job with a specific processing time, release date, due date, and precedence relations. We develop several sufficient conditions to derive setup jobs. We specify their parameters and precedence relations such that the optimal solution value of the modified problem obtained by ignoring the setup times, not the setup jobs, is no larger than the optimal solution value of the original problem. One lower bound for the modified problem proceeds by allowing preemption. Due to the agreeable precedence structure, the preemptive problem is solvable in O(n log n) time.

## 7. A Multidimensional Model of Client Success When Engaging External Consultants
### Author(s):
- Guy G. Gable
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
Too often the relationship between clients and external consultants is perceived as one of protagonist versus antagonist. Stories on dramatic, failed consultancies abound, as do related anecdotal quips. A contributing factor to many apparently failed consultancies is a poor appreciation by both the client and consultant of the client's true goals for the project and how to assess progress toward these goals. This paper presents and analyses a measurement model for assessing client success when engaging an external consultant. Three main areas of assessment are identified: (1) the consultant's recommendations, (2) client learning, and (3) consultant performance. Engagement success is empirically measured along these dimensions through a series of case studies and a subsequent survey of clients and consultants involved in 85 computer-based information system selection projects. Validation of the model constructs suggests the existence of six distinct and individually important dimensions of engagement success. Both clients and consultants are encouraged to attend to these dimensions in pre-engagement proposal and selection processes, and post-engagement evaluation of outcomes.

## 8. The Impact of Environmental Management on Firm Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
Environmental management has the potential to play a pivotal role in the financial performance of the firm. Many individuals suggest that profitability is hurt by the higher production costs of environmental management initiatives, while others cite anecdotal evidence of increased profitability. A theoretical model is proposed that links strong environmental management to improved perceived future financial performance, as measured by stock market performance. The linkage to firm performance is tested empirically using financial event methodology and archival data of firm-level environmental and financial performance. Significant positive returns were measured for strong environmental management as indicated by environmental performance awards, and significant negative returns were measured for weak environmental management as indicated by environmental crises. The implicit financial market valuation of these events also was estimated. Cross-sectional analysis of the environmental award events revealed differences for first-time awards and between industries. First-time award announcements were associated with greater increases in market valuation, although smaller increases were observed for firms in environmentally dirty industries, possibly indicative of market skepticism. This linkage between environmental management and financial performance can be used by both researchers and practitioners as one measure of the benefits experienced by industry leaders, and as one criterion against which to measure investment alternatives.

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1996
### Abstract:
While cultural fit has been acknowledged to be a potentially important factor in mergers and acquisitions, the concept has been ill-defined, with no distinction drawn between the national and corporate levels of culture. By examining both international and domestic mergers, the present study assesses the relative role of national and corporate cultural fit in predicting effective integration between merger partners. The innovative, nonparametric co-plot method is introduced, and its main advantagethe simultaneous consideration of both variables and observationsis utilized to explore cultural fit in the two groups of mergers. The findings confirm that national and corporate culture are separate constructs with variable attitudinal and behavioral correlates.
