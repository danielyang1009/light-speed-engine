## 1. Equivalence of Taxes and Subsidies in the Control of Production Externalities
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
We are always better off having many policies that can achieve a given objective because it extends the criteria that can be included in policy selection. This paper studies the equivalence between taxes and subsidies in the control of negative production externalities. In our models, under the tax regime, firms that take no treatment action to mitigate the damage caused by their negative externalities are punished, whereas under the subsidy regime, firms are rewarded for externality treatment activities. We employ a formulation where firms differ in the vintage of their production technology and as a result differ in profitability, negative externality generation, and the cost of treatment. We consider three measures as policy objectives: total output, total damage from negative externalities, and social welfare. We find reasonable conditions where, with an appropriate setting of uniform lump-sum and unit subsidies, the policy maker can achieve a pair of policy objectives equivalent to those obtained using unit taxes. Thus, either tax or subsidy regimes can be used to achieve desired levels of one or two policy objectives, allowing other factors such as fairness, equity, or international trade issues to be considered in policy selection.

## 2. Reservation Planning for Elective Surgery Under Uncertain Demand for Emergency Surgery

### Abstract:
This work concerns the advance scheduling of elective surgery when the operating rooms' capacity utilization by emergency surgery, as well as by elective procedures, is uncertain. New requests for bookings of elective surgery arrive each day. Such procedures preferably would be performed as soon as possible, but admitting too many patients may result in exceeding a day's capacity, possibly necessitating turning away some emergency cases. So the problem facing the hospital at the start of each day is how many of the additional requests for elective surgery to assign for that day. We provide a stochastic dynamic programming model for this aggregate advance scheduling problem. The model has some novel mathematical features. We analyze it and characterize the nature of the optimal policy, which is not necessarily of a control-limit type. Plausible numerical examples which confirm our theoretical results and provide additional insights are reported.

## 3. A Graphical Analysis of Ratio-Scaled Paired Comparison Data
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
One of the building blocks of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty [Saaty, T. L. 1977. A scaling method for priorities in hierarchical structures. Math. Psych.15 234281.]) is the ratio-scaled assessment of an agent's preferences between pairs of alternatives. This article shows how it is possible to visualize such data and to detect cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies in the respondent's judgments. The graphical method used to display preferences is not new in itself: it dates back at least to the work of Gower (Gower, J. C. 1977. The analysis of asymmetry and orthogonality. J.-R. Barra, F. Brodeau, G. Romier, B. Van Cutsem, eds. Recent Developments in Statistics. North-Holland, Amsterdam, 109123.), and many variants of his technique can be found in the literature. But Gower plots provide an especially valuable diagnostic tool in the context of AHP, as discussed and abundantly illustrated herein.

## 4. Product Variety and Manufacturing Performance: Evidence from the International Automotive Assembly Plant Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
This paper examines the effect of product variety on manufacturing performance, defined here as total labor productivity and consumer-perceived product quality. Using data from the International Motor Vehicle Program (M.I.T.) study of 70 assembly plants worldwide, the paper examines three dimensions of product variety, at fundamental, peripheral, and intermediate levels. The international sample reveals great variation in the distribution of each type of product variety in different regions, reflecting in part different strategies for variety. Furthermore, the impact of different kinds of product variety on performance varies, and is generally much less than the conventional manufacturing wisdom would predict. However, an intermediate type of product variety, here called parts complexity, was found to have a persistent negative impact on productivity. Finally, the study provides partial support for the hypothesis that management policies, in both operations and human resource areas, can facilitate the absorption of higher levels of product variety, i.e. that lean production plants are capable of handling higher levels of product variety with less adverse effect on total labor productivity than traditional mass production plants.

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows.

## 6. Innovation, Competitive Advantage and Rent: A Model and Test
### Author(s):

- I. C. MacMillan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
Four antecedents, it is argued, are necessary precursors for a firm to capture rents from innovation. The antecedents are causal understanding; innovation team proficiency; emergence and mobilization of new competences; and creation of competitive advantages, each of which are conceptually distinct and precisely defined in the paper. These constructs are linked together in a stage model and subsequently operationalized and tested using LISREL. Substantial support is found for the central thesis, that achieving each of the four antecedent processes increases the predicted rents from an innovation project.

## 7. The Design of Optimal Conservation Programs by Electric Utilities Considering Strategic Consumer Behavior
### Author(s):
- Franz Wirl
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
The practice of utility demand side conservation programs, one of the most topical issues of utility management, provokes strategic reactions of consumers. As a solution of this moral hazard, optimal conservation programs are characterized when the consumers differ either with respect to their subjective time preference or with respect to the level of demand. In particular, we derive incentive compatible conservation schemes that mitigate strategic behavior. These incentives differ starkly from actual programs. First, the costs of conservation may exceed the avoided costs, yet accepting such high costs (at the margin) need not imply a large conservation. Second, such incentive scheme should bypass the inefficient consumers (e.g., the poor) but should instead target consumers who act efficiently and have a high demand (e.g., the rich).

## 8. Quality Awards and the Market Value of the Firm: An Empirical Investigation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
This paper empirically investigates the impact of winning a quality award on the market value of firms by estimating the mean abnormal change in the stock prices of a sample of firms on the date when information about winning a quality award was publicly announced. We note that the abnormal returns generated by the quality award winning announcements provide a lower bound for the impact of implementing an effective quality award improvement program. Our results show that the stock market reacts positively to quality award announcements. Statistically significant mean abnormal returns on the day of the announcements ranged from a low of 0.59% to a high of 0.67% depending on the model used to generate the abnormal returns. The reaction was particularly strong for smaller firms (mean abnormal returns ranged from low of 1.16% to a high of 1.26%), and for firms that won awards from independent organizations such as Malcolm Baldrige, Philip Crosby, etc. (mean abnormal returns ranged from a low of 1.31% to a high of 1.65%). Winning a quality award also conveys information about the systematic risk of the firm. We find a statistically significant decrease in the equity and the asset betas after the quality award announcement. There is also evidence to suggest that large firms experience negative stock price performance in the second year before winning quality awards, which is followed by a year of positive performance. Small firms experience a positive stock price performance in the second year before winning quality awards but no negative performance before winning quality awards.

## 9. When Should a Roving Server Be Patient?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
When polling systems are used to model real-world systems, it is typically assumed that the server switches continuously (roves) even when there are no waiting jobs in the system. However, requiring the server to be patient, instead of having it rove, might be more realistic. Furthermore, operational control of these systems can be improved by knowing answers to questions like under what circumstances should be roving server be patient? and at which stations?.

## 10. A Note on Variance Reducing Group Maintenance Policies
### Author(s):
- John G. Wilson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
Group replacement policies for machines operating in parallel are generally evaluated by computing the associated expected cost per unit time. However, as with all stochastically evolving systems, variance should play an important managerial role. No matter which policy is used by the maintenance manager, knowledge of the associated variance provides important information about the variability of the costs that will be incurred by using this policy. Additionally, there will be cases where a decision maker is willing to incur increased expected cost per unit time in order to reduce the variability of the costs among cycles. This paper demonstrates that it is feasible and practicable to calculate the variance of the cost per unit time associated with group maintenance policies.

## 11. DEA on Relaxed Convexity Assumptions
### Author(s):
- Peter Bogetoft
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Petersen (Petersen, N. C. 1990. Data envelopment analysis on a relaxed set of assumptions. Management Sci.36 305314.) proposed to relax the convexity assumptions invoked in traditional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Unfortunately, the new approach is not consistent with the relaxed assumptions. Also, the efficiency evaluations in input and output spaces are based on different technologies assumptions. The aim of this paper is to clarify which assumptions are actually involved and to develop modifications such that the input and output based measures are consistent. In effect, a family of DEA methods based on relaxed convexity assumptions is identified.

## 12. Using Rank Statistics for Determining Programmatic Efficiency Differences in Data Envelopment Analysis
### Author(s):
- Patrick L. Brockett
- Boaz Golany
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
This paper presents an analytical approach, based on rank statistics, to the issue of comparing programs within Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency evaluation framework. The program evaluation procedure distinguishes between managerial and programmatic inefficiency and uses the Mann-Whitney rank statistic to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences observed between a treatment program and its control group program after adjusting for differences in managerial efficiency between the programs. A numerical example, based on the data used to evaluate the educational enhancement of the Program Follow Through, is used to illustrate the proposed statistical procedures.

## 13. Note: A Problem with the Decomposition of Technical Inefficiency into Scale and Congestion Components
### Author(s):
- John McDonald
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1996
### Abstract:
In 1988, Byrnes, Fre, Grosskopf and Lovell define a decomposition of inefficiency differentials into scale and congestion components. This note shows that the decomposition may be sensitive to the order in which the two components are calculated, and, consequently, use of the decomposition may result in misleading signals being given to management.
