## 1. Executive Succession, Strategic Reorientation and Performance Growth: A Longitudinal Study in the U.S. Cement Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This research explores the performance consequences of CEO succession, executive team change, and strategic reorientation in different contexts. Based on team demography and organization learning ideas, we argue that CEO succession or executive team change enhances incremental organization change, while either strategic reorientation or the combination of CEO succession with executive team change triggers discontinuous organization change. We hypothesize that these contrasting intervention modes are appropriate in different contexts. A longitudinal study of the U.S. cement industry from 19181986 demonstrates that simple CEO succession is positively associated with subsequent performance when context is stable, but significantly more negatively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. Executive team change has significant effects on organization adaptation in both stable and turbulent contexts. Strategic reorientations are negatively associated with subsequent performance in stable contexts, but significantly more positively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. As a set, these results reinforce a demographic approach to succession research and indicate that CEO succession, executive team change, and reorientation are each distinct and important levers shaping organization adaptation. The impacts of these levers are contingent on organization context.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
When the Nelder-Mead method is used to optimize the expected response of a stochastic system (e.g., an output of a discrete-event simulation model), the simplex-resizing steps of the method introduce risks of inappropriate termination. We give analytical and empirical results describing the performance of Nelder-Mead when it is applied to a response function that incorporates an additive white-noise error, and we use these results to develop new modifications of Nelder-Mead that yield improved estimates of the optimal expected response. Compared to Nelder-Mead, the best performance was obtained by a modified method, RS + S9, in which (a) the best point in the simplex is reevaluated at each shrink, step and (b) the simplex is reduced by 10% (rather than 50%) at each shrink step. In a suite of 18 test problems that were adapted from the MINPACK collection of NETLIB, the expected response at the estimated optimal point obtained by RS + S9 had errors that averaged 15% less than at the original method's estimated optimal point, at an average cost of three times as many function evaluations. Two well-known existing modifications for stochastic responses, the (n + 3)-rule and the next-to-worst rule, were found to be inferior to the new modification RS + S9.

## 3. Option Pricing with Stochastic Volatility: Information-Time vs. Calendar-Time
### Author(s):
- Carolyn W. Chang
- Jack S. K. Chang
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
Empirical evidence has shown that subordinated processes represent well the price changes of stocks and futures. Using either transaction counts or trading volume as a proxy for information arrival, it supports the contention that volatility is stochastic in calendar-time because of random information arrival, and thus becomes stationary in information-time. This contention has also been supported later in theoretical models. In this paper we investigate the implication of this contention to option pricing.

## 4. Optimizing Multinomial Logit Profit Functions
### Author(s):
- Ward Hanson
- Kipp Martin
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
The multinomial logit model is a standard approach for determining the probability of purchase in product line problems. When the purchase probabilities are multiplied by product contribution margins, the resulting profit function is generally nonconcave. Because of this, standard nonlinear search procedures may terminate at a local optimum which is far from the global optimum. We present a simple procedure designed to alleviate this problem. The key idea of this procedure is to find a path of prices from the global optimum of a related, but concave logit profit function, to the global optimum of the true (but nonconcave) logit profit function.

## 5. Risk Propensity and Firm Performance: A Study of the Petroleum Exploration Industry
### Author(s):
- Michael R. Walls
- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
This paper explores the differences in observed risk propensity among petroleum firms and their impact on firm performance. In this work, we (1) develop a decision theoretic model which measures a firm's risk propensity in the form of an implied utility function; (2) investigate changes in corporate risk propensity with respect to changes in firm size; and (3) examine the relationships between firms' risk propensities and alternative dimensions of economic performance, including ex post risk and return measures. We also develop a new risk propensity measure, the Risk Tolerance Ratio (RTR), which controls for firm size and allows firms to be differentiated in terms of relative risk propensity. The motivation for this work is managerial concerns regarding appropriate risk-taking behavior and the effect of risky choice on firm performance. This methodology has importance business strategy implications in that we are able to make strong inferences about causal relationships between ex ante risk-taking and performance. Our findings are compelling in that corporate risk propensity seems to matter, and that decisions about corporate risk policy have a significant impact on the petroleum firm's economic performance.

## 6. A Generalized Qualitative-Response Model and the Analysis of Management Fraud

### Published:

### Abstract:
Management fraud has become a topic of increasing interest to the public accounting profession. Prior research indicates that management fraud is seldom experienced by audiGtors. As a result, it is doubtful that auditors have a well-developed cognitive model for making fraud risk assessments as part of the audit planning process. Early research studies attempted to identify factors that could be linked to the occurrence of management fraud, while more recent work has attempted to build models to predict the presence of management fraud. In this paper, we report on a study that uses a powerful generalized qualitative-response model, EGB2, to model and predict management fraud based on a set of data developed by an international public accounting firm. The EGB2 specification includes the probit and logit models and others as special cases. Moreover, EGB2 easily accommodates asymmetric costs of type I and type II errors. This is important for public accounting firms since failure to predict fraud when it is present (a type II error) is usually very costly to the firm in terms of litigation. The results demonstrate good predictive capability for both symmetric and asymmetric cost assumptions.

## 7. The Magnitude of Errors in Proximal Multiattribute Decision Analysis with Probabilistically Dependent Attributes
### Author(s):
- James L. Corner
- Craig W. Kirkwood
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the accuracy of an approximation procedure for evaluating alternatives under uncertainty with multiple evaluation attributes. This approximation uses only the first two moments of the probability distributions for the alternatives, and hence it can substantially reduce the amount of information which must be collected in order to evaluate alternatives when evaluation attributes are probabilistically dependent. The accuracy of the approximation is investigated by comparing results from using it with exact calculations for a variety of situations representative of those found in decision analysis practice. This investigation shows that the approximation is accurate for situations representative of many decision analysis applications. However, caution is needed in applying the approximation in some situations where it may give inaccurate results. Characteristics of cases where the approximation is less accurate are presented.

## 8. Information Systems Planning: A Model and Empirical Tests
### Author(s):

- Ron Weber
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
Empirical studies of information systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model.

## 9. Impact of Plant Size and Focus on Productivity: An Empirical Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
Recent popular business literature has suggested that there is a significant trend in the United States for firms to decrease the size and increase the focus of manufacturing plants they operate, and that this leads to higher productivity. This paper tests empirically the validity of these claims. We analyze data on virtually the entire population of manufacturing plants in the United States and find that, contrary to the popular business literature, the average size of plants increased during the period 19721984. However, consistent with the popular notion, the rate of growth in plant size slowed considerably, and even turned negative for a category of large plants. Plant focus did increase during this period. We then investigate the relationship between productivity and plant characteristics including plant size and plant focus. Overall, our results do not support the popular argument that reduction in plant size results in productivity gains. However, we do find support for this argument in some two-digit SIC industries; also, scale economies in the entire population decreased over the period 19721982. We also find only limited support for the popular argument that plant focus increases productivity.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1996
### Abstract:
Neural networks have been advocated as an alternative to traditional statistical forecasting methods. In the present experiment, time series forecasts produced by neural networks are compared with forecasts from six statistical time series methods generated in a major forecasting competition (Makridakis et al. [Makridakis, S., A. Anderson, R. Carbone, R. Fildes, M. Hibon, R. Lewandowski, J. Newton, E. Parzen, R. Winkler. 1982. The accuracy of extrapolation (time series) methods: Results of a forecasting competition. J. Forecasting1 111153.]); the traditional method forecasts were estimated by experts in the particular technique. The neural networks were estimated using the same ground rules as the competition. Across monthly and quarterly time series, the neural networks did significantly better than traditional methods. As suggested by theory, the neural networks were particularly effective for discontinuous time series.
