## 1. Involving Patients in the Cadaveric Kidney Transplant Allocation Process: A Decision-Theoretic Perspective
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
The United Network for Organ Sharing system of allocating cadaveric kidneys for transplantation permits only minimal involvement of patients in the selection process. The system ignores potential variations in the importance that patients may attach to outcomes associated with the transplant decision. For instance, some patients may prefer only kidneys that will give them a very favorable chance to achieve a successful transplant. We designed a decision model in which patients are surveyed about their preferences for health states that in turn affect decisions about the type of donor kidneys that would be acceptable for transplantation. Our analyses show that patients with favorable transplant characteristics (e.g., young age, good health, good immunologic match between the donor kidney and the recipient) or who expect a minimal improvement in quality of life after successful transplantation can afford to be selective when considering which kidneys to accept for transplantation. Involving patients in selecting the optimal donor-kidney should improve patients' quality and duration of life with end-stage renal disease, and thereby improve the overall efficiency of the U.S. kidney transplantation program.

## 2. Budgets as Dynamic Gatekeepers
### Author(s):
- Harold Pollack

### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
Most large organizations allocate resources by means of fixed budgets: each subunit is normally entitled to spend a defined amount over a fixed period, usually one year. Fixed budgets create clear incentives for subunits to control costs. Yet such arrangements create major incentives for dynamic inefficiency, for example by encouraging subunits to exhaust their budgets toward the end of the fiscal year.

## 3. Task Complexity, Equilibrium Selection, and Learning: An Experimental Study
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
We consider several coordination games with multiple equilibria each of which is a different division of a fixed pie. Laboratory experiments are conducted to address whether task complexity affects the selection of equilibrium by subjects. Three measures of task complexitycardinality of choice space, level of iterative knowledge of rationality, and level of iterative knowledge of strategyare manipulated and tested. Results suggest the three measures can predict choice behavior. Since strategically equivalent games can have different task complexity measures, our results imply that subjects are sensitive to game form presentation. We also fit data using three adaptive learning models: 1) Cournot, 2) Fictitious Play, and 3) Payoff Reinforcement, in increasing order of required cognitive effort. The Fictitious Play model, which tracks only cumulative frequencies of opponents' past behaviors fits the data best.

## 4. A Bayesian Approach to Managing Learning-Curve Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a Bayesian decision theoretic model of optimal production in the presence of learning-curve uncertainty. The well-known learning-curve model is extended to allow for random variation in the learning process with uncertainty regarding some parameter of the variation. A production run generates excess value (above its current revenue) for a Bayesian manager in two ways: it pushes the firm further along the learning curve, increasing the likelihood of lower costs for future runs; and it provides information, through the observed costs, that reduces the uncertainty regarding the rate at which costs are decreasing. We provide conditions under which one of the classical deterministic learning-curve resultsnamely, that optimal production exceeds the myopic levelcarries over to the extended framework. We demonstrate that another classical deterministic learning-curve resultnamely, that optimal production increases with cumulative productiondoes not hold in the Bayesian setting.

## 5. Organizational Complexity and Innovation: Developing and Testing Multiple Contingency Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
Current research in organizational innovation is extensive, yet, because of limitations in scope, most studies are not adequately encompassing. These studies typically relate organizational variables to innovation and control at most for the effect of one contingency factor. Because innovation depends upon a complex host of factors, such theories have limited predictive application. This study intends to develop and test theories that explain the variation in the organizational complexity-innovation relationship in greater detail. The study considers two major indicators of organizational complexitystructural complexity and organizational size. Hypotheses are proposed on the effects of 14 contingency factors on the relationships between structural complexity and innovation and organizational size and innovation. The contingency factors include environmental uncertainty, organizational size, industrial sectors, types of innovation, and stages of innovation adoption. Using a meta-analytic procedure for multivariate analysis, the hypotheses are then tested with data from published studies in organizational innovation during the last three decades. The effects of four methods variablesoperational definitions of innovation, structural complexity and size, and similarity of data sourcesare controlled for in testing the hypotheses. This process results in two powerful and encompassing models: (1) the association between structural complexity and innovation depends upon operational definition of complexity, environmental uncertainty, use of manufacturing organizations, use of service organizations, focus on technical innovations, focus on product innovations, and focus on implementation of innovation; and (2) the association between organizational size and innovation depends upon operational definition of size, environmental uncertainty, use of service organizations, use of for-profit organizations, focus on technical innovations, and focus on product innovations. These models suggest avenues for further theory development and research, which we discuss.

## 6. Optimization of the Transient and Steady-State Behavior of Discrete Event Systems
### Author(s):
- Sigrn Andradttir
### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
We present a general framework for applying simulation to optimize the behavior of discrete event systems. Our approach involves modeling the discrete event system under study as a general state space Markov chain whose distribution depends on the decision parameters. We then show how simulation and the likelihood ratio method can be used to evaluate the performance measure of interest and its gradient, and we present conditions that guarantee that the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation algorithm will converge almost surely to the optimal values of the decision parameters. Both transient and steady-state performance measures are considered. For steady-state performance measures, we consider both the case when the Markov chain of interest is regenerative in the standard sense, as well as the case when this Markov chain is Harris recurrent, and thereby regenerative in a wider sense.

## 7. A Lagrangean-Based Heuristic for Dynamic Multilevel Multiitem Constrained Lotsizing with Setup Times
### Author(s):
- Horst Tempelmeier
- Matthias Derstroff
### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
In this paper a heuristic approach for the dynamic multilevel multiitem lotsizing problem in general product structures with multiple constrained resources and setup times is proposed. With the help of Lagrangean relaxation the capacitated multilevel multiitem lotsizing problem is decomposed into several uncapacitated single-item lotsizing problems. From the solutions of these single-item problems lower bounds on the minimum objective function value are derived. Upper bounds are generated by means of a heuristic finite scheduling procedure. The quality of the approach is tested with reference to various problem groups of differing sizes.

## 8. Biases in Retrospective Self-Reports of Time Use: An Empirical Study of Computer Users
### Author(s):
- Fred Collopy
### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
Research on information systems (IS) use has often relied upon retrospective self-reports. One example is when the amount of time spent using a system is reported, often as an indication of user acceptance. In this study, self-assessments of computer usage are compared with computer-monitored interactive use and connect time for 401 managers and professionals. When self-assessed use was compared with logged interactive use, there was a 32% difference in the average amount of use (3.9 vs. 2.7 hours/day). When the self-assessment was compared with total connect time, the averages were similar to each other (3.9 vs. 4.0 hours). In both comparisons, though, there were considerable differences between individual self-assessments and logged time (with a median absolute percentage difference of 47% when compared with logged connect time). Individual estimates of use tended to regress toward the population's mean use. Those whose use of the system was relatively light overestimated their use, while heavy users underestimated theirs. When a test of the relationship between user satisfaction and amount of use was conducted using self-assessments, the relationship was not statistically significant. When the same test was conducted using logged connect time, the relationship was significant. These results suggest that care should be exercised in operationalizing the user acceptance construct through self-reports of time use.

## 9. Commonalities in Reengineered Business Processes: Models and Issues
### Author(s):
- John A. Buzacott
### Published:
- 1 May 1996
### Abstract:
Process reengineering advocates making radical changes in how processing systems are structured, such as moving away from systems that use the principles of division of labor and division of management. Using formal system models from queueing theory, this paper explores the conditions under which such radical changes in system structure are likely to be appropriate. In general, a fairly high degree of variability in task times seems to be necessary.
