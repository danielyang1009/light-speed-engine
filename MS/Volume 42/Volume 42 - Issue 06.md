### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
In this paper we discuss stochastic Economic Lot Scheduling Problems (ELSP), i.e., settings where several items need to be produced in a common facility with limited capacity, under significant uncertainty regarding demands, production times, setup times, or combinations thereof. We propose a class of production/inventory strategies for stochastic ELSPs and describe how a strategy which minimizes holding, backlogging, and setup costs within this class can be effectively determined and evaluated. The proposed class of strategies is simple but rich and effective: when the facility is assigned to a given item, production continues until either a specific target inventory level is reached or a specific production batch has been completed; the different items are produced in a given sequence or rotation cycle, possibly with idle times inserted between the completion of an item's production batch and the setup for the next item. An optimal strategy within the class can be determined, and all relevant performance measures can be evaluated in just a few CPU seconds, using a 486-based PC. We also derive a number of easily computable lower bounds for the optimal cost value and establish a comparison with deterministic ELSPs.

## 2. A Fast Taboo Search Algorithm for the Job Shop Problem
### Author(s):
- Eugeniusz Nowicki
- Czeslaw Smutnicki
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
A fast and easily implementable approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a minimum makespan in a job shop is presented. The algorithm is based on a taboo search technique with a specific neighborhood definition which employs a critical path and blocks of operations notions. Computational experiments (up to 2,000 operations) show that the algorithm not only finds shorter makespans than the best approximation approaches but also runs in shorter time. It solves the well-known 10  10 hard benchmark problem within 30 seconds on a personal computer.

## 3. Heuristic Scheduling of Parallel Heterogeneous Queues with Set-Ups
### Author(s):
- Izak Duenyas
- Mark P. Van Oyen
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of allocating a single server to a system of queues with Poisson arrivals. Each queue represents a class of jobs and possesses a holding cost rate, general service distribution, and general set-up time distribution. The objective is to minimize the expected holding cost due to the waiting of jobs. A set-up time is required to switch from one queue to another. We provide a limited characterization of the optimal policy and a simple heuristic scheduling policy for this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic over a wide range of problem instances.

## 5. Solving Multiple Objective Programming Problems Using Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks: The Interactive FFANN Procedure
### Author(s):
- Minghe Sun
- Antonie Stam
- Ralph E. Steuer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a new interactive procedure for solving multiple objective programming problems. Based upon feed-forward artificial neural networks (FFANNs), the method is called the Interactive FFANN Procedure. In the procedure, the decision maker articulates preference information over representative samples from the nondominated set either by assigning preference values to the sample solutions or by making pairwise comparisons in a fashion similar to that in the Analytic Hierarchy Process. With this information, a FFANN is trained to represent the decision maker's preference structure. Then, using the FFANN, an optimization problem is solved to search for improved solutions. An example is given to illustrate the Interactive FFANN Procedure. Also, the procedure is compared computationally with the Tchebycheff Method (Steuer and Choo [Steuer, R. E., E.-U. Choo. 1983. An interactive weighted Tchebycheff procedure for multiple objective programming. Math. Programming26(1) 326344.]). The computational results indicate that the Interactive FFANN Procedure produces good solutions and is robust with regard to the neural network architecture.

## 7. The Effect of Uncertainty and Information Asymmetry on the Structure of Compensation Contracts: A Test of Competing Models
### Author(s):
- Narayan S. Umanath
- Manash R. Ray
- Terry L. Campbell
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
This research note reports results of a laboratory experiment conducted as a follow-up investigation of an earlier study by Umanath, Ray and Campbell (Umanath, N. S., M. R. Ray, T. L. Campbell. 1993. The impact of perceived environmental uncertainty and perceived agent effectiveness on the composition of compensation contracts. Management Sci. (January) 3245.). Here, we focus on a specific unexpected result of Umanath et al. who found evidence contradicting the theoretical prediction with respect to the impact of environmental uncertainty on the composition of compensation contracts. Umanath et al., in retrospect, offered an explanation for their unexpected finding based on an alternative theory under the same agency framework. Our results not only ratify the alternative explanation offered by Umanath et al., but also identify information symmetry/asymmetry as the contingent factor capable of reconciling the apparently contradicting predictions of the two agency-based theories used in this research.

## 8. When Competition Eclipses Cooperation: An Event History Analysis of Joint Venture Failure
### Author(s):
- Seung Ho Park
- Michael V. Russo
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
Why do so many joint ventures fail? Despite the fact that their success is the exception rather than the rule, the literature on why joint venture performance has been so poor remains fragmentary. We address this issue, adopting a transaction-cost economics perspective and modeling joint ventures as governance structures that blend the advantages and drawbacks of both markets and hierarchies. Using a data base on electronics industry ventures and event history analysis, we identify several predictors of joint venture failure and test for their influences. A key finding is that the presence of competition between joint venture partners outside of the agreement significantly impairs chances for the operation's chance of survival. We also find clear evidence that the failure rate of joint ventures is nonmonotonic, rising to a peak in the middle term and then declining. Finally, we compare and contrast predictors of terminations due to failure to those due to acquisition of the joint venture by one of its partners. Our overall conclusions highlight implications for strategic choice theory-building and the management of joint ventures.

## 9. Medical Resident Work Schedules: Design and Evaluation by Stimulation Modeling

### Published:

### Abstract:
Society has demanded reform in medical resident work scheduling; consequently, hospitals are implementing changes having organizational, clinical, financial, social, emotional, and educational consequences for physician training and patient care. We report the use of simulation modeling as an approach to evaluate the outcomes of alternative designs prior to implementation. Mobile resources such as physicians with complex job descriptions and patients with time-varying arrival processes complicated the modeling task. A flexible, powerful simulation language helped to model resource decision rules and the frequent preemptions of less urgent activities as more urgent requests arise. A distribution fitting package enhanced the synthesis of data from diverse sources into distributions that adequately modeled input processes. The resulting simulation model was used to examine alternatives in the design of a new housestaff work schedule. We were able to predict accurately the effects on the sleep and activity profile of interns when their schedules were modified. Furthermore, this model has remained an asset for investigating consequences of many types of variation within the system, including changes in patient demand as well as numbers or job descriptions of the housestaff.

## 10. Strategic Spillovers and Incentives for Research and Development
### Author(s):
- Dietmar Harhoff
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
This paper develops a model in which a monopolist supplier can contribute to downstream product improvements by creating knowledge spillovers which downstream firms use as a substitute for their own R&D efforts. Although a market for R&D information does not exist, the supplier may appropriate an indirect return on R&D for two reasons. Sufficiently high levels of spillover information lead to greater downstream product quality, and spillover information reduces the equilibrium sunk cost of R&D for downstream firms and thus facilitates entry. Both effects cause an expansion of downstream output and enhance the demand for the supplier's intermediate good. Given sufficiently strong incentives for supplier R&D, the locus of R&D shifts partially from the downstream to the upstream industry. R&D expenditures, technological opportunities, and downstream industry structure are determined endogenously. Weak appropriability conditions in the downstream industry enhance innovation incentives in the supply sector.

## 11. Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Numerical Finance

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1996
### Abstract:
This paper introduces and illustrates a new version of the Monte Carlo method that has attractive properties for the numerical valuation of derivatives. The traditional Monte Carlo method has proven to be a powerful and flexible tool for many types of derivatives calculations. Under the conventional approach pseudo-random numbers are used to evaluate the expression of interest. Unfortunately, the use of pseudo-random numbers yields an error bound that is probabilistic which can be a disadvantage. Another drawback of the standard approach is that many simulations may be required to obtain a high level of accuracy. There are several ways to improve the convergence of the standard method. This paper suggests a new approach which promises to be very useful for applications in finance. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods use sequences that are deterministic instead of random. These sequences improve convergence and give rise to deterministic error bounds. The method is explained and illustrated with several examples. These examples include complex derivatives such as basket options, Asian options, and energy swaps.
