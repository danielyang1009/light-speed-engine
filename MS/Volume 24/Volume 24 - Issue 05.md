## 1. Stochastic Horizons for the Aggregate Planning Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
This paper develops a methodology for showing how forecast horizons for stochastic planning problems relate to the planning procedures and the information system within the organization. To illustrate the approach we have chosen a relatively straightforward production problem where the firm can meet a fluctuating demand pattern through a combination of overtime and inventory-related options. We show that the optimal production plan is monotonically non-decreasing in the demand sequence so that bounds can be placed on the optimal first period production plan for an N-period problem. These bounds together with information and computationally-related costs are used in specifying a methodology for determining forecast horizons. An illustrative example suggests that such horizons are likely to be small in many realistic cases. The concluding section indicates how this methodology can be utilized for specifying stochastic horizons for more general aggregate planning decisions in organizations.

### Author(s):
- Augusto A. Legasto, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper the results and implications of an application of dynamic simulation modeling to the study of control of social unrest in a developing country are presented. The model demonstrates the use of a multiple-objective, multiple-group objective function designed to monitor the pressure level of social unrest in the modeled system. An outline of the model structure is presented and sample relationships are explained in detail to demonstrate the dynamic and feedback nature of the model.

## 3. Grouping Observations in Digital Simulation
### Author(s):
- George S. Fishman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for deriving a confidence interval for a population mean from the output of a simulation run. The method groups the observations on a run into batches and uses these batches as the basic data for analysis. The technique is not new. What is new is the procedure for determining how to group the observations into batches that satisfy certain assumptions necessary for the technique to work correctly. It is inexpensive and requires a moderate knowledge of statistics. The results of testing the method on a single server queuing model with Poisson distributed arrivals of exponentially distributed service times (M/M/1), indicate that the proposed technique performs as theory suggests for moderate activity levels. However, for higher activity levels performance is below theoretical expectation for small sample sizes n. As n increases, performance converges to expectation. Moreover, two calculations of the sample sizes needed to obtain results with moderate accuracy indicate that these sample sizes are in a range where the procedure is expected to perform with small error.

## 4. A Diffusion Approximation to the Multi-Server Queue
### Author(s):
- Baruch Halachmi
- W. R. Franta
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
Exact solutions to queueing problems with customer interarrival times and customer service times drawn from arbitrary (generalized) distributions have not been found. We are, therefore, much interested in good quality approximate solutions to such problems. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining (approximately) the distribution of the number of customers in a multiserver queue for which both the customer interarnval and customer service times are drawn from arbitrary distributions. The approximation is based on the theory of diffusion, depends only on the means and variances of the interarnval and service time distributions, and as the numeric examples attest is of very good quality when the queueing system is heavily loaded. The approximate solution is obtained via a very simple computational procedure, so that good quality approximate solutions to such problems can be easily produced.

## 5. The Single Machine Problem with Quadratic Penalty Function of Completion Times: A Branch-and-Bound Solution
### Author(s):
- W. Townsend
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
N jobs are to be sequenced on a single machine, each job carrying a penalty cost which is a quadratic function of its completion time. The objective is to find a sequence which minimizes the total penalty. Criteria are developed for ordering a pair of adjacent jobs in a sequence and these are incorporated into a branch-and-bound procedure.

## 6. Finding Minimal Center-Median Convex Combination (Cent-Dian) of a Graph
### Author(s):
- Jonathan Halpern
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
The graph median and center problems are well known with numerous possible applications. The first is suitable for locating a facility providing a routine service, by means of minimizing the average distance of customers to it. The second is appropriate for emergency services where the objective is to have the furthest customer as near as possible to the center. In reality a combination of both, usually antagonistic, goals is common. This paper presents a procedure to locate a facility on a graph, such that a convex combination of the median and the center objective functions is minimized. The term cent-dian is coined for this point of the graph. Since it is usually difficult to assign precise weights to the two objectives, when they are convexly combined, the procedure generates the cent-dians for all possible combinations. Finally, an equivalent median problem on an expanded graph is presented.

## 7. Optimization of Priority QueuesA Semi-Markov Decision Chain Approach
### Author(s):
- Derek Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of optimally controlling a semi-Markov chain with countable state space and unbounded costs. We assume that a particular control is suspected of being optimal and derive conditions for checking whether this is so. The result is applied to the following queueing system. A single server serves two types of customers who arrive at random and join separate queues. The two types of customer differ in respect of their arrival rates, waiting costs and service time distributions. The server has control over which queue to serve at any time and may interrupt the service of a customer in order to serve a customer of the other queue. In the latter case, however, an interruption cost is incurred which reflects the disruption or loss of goodwill entailed. The server requires a policy for determining when he should switch queues which minimises the long run expected cost per unit time. We find that such a policy specifies that one of the queues has higher priority. When the service time distribution of the other queue is exponential, this priority is pre-emptive if the length of the higher priority queue exceeds a critical value and is otherwise postponable. When the distribution is Erlang-2, the priority depends both on the length of the priority queue and the phase of service.

## 8. A Renewal Decision Problem
### Author(s):
- C. Derman
- G. J. Lieberman
- S. M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
A system (e.g., a motor vehicle) must operate for t units of time. A certain component (e.g., a battery) is essential for its operation and must be replaced each time it fails. There are n types of replacement components. A type i replacement costs Ci and has a random life with distribution depending on i. There is no salvage value associated with the particular component in use when the system terminates. The problem is to assign the initial component and subsequent replacements from among the n types so as to minimize the total expected cost of providing an operative component for the t units of time. This paper treats this problem when the life distributions are exponential for each type and when t is fixed or has a truncated exponential distribution. Related problems are also considered.

## 9. NoteOn A Renewal Decision Problem
### Author(s):
- Donald R. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
In this issue of the journal, Derman, Lieberman and Ross treat a replacement problem where several types (grades) of components are available. They conjecture than any component type that is more expensive to both purchase and to run than some other component type will never be used in an optimal replacement policy. We prove a theorem that, together with their results, proves this conjecture.

## 10. An HMMS Type Interactive Model for Aggregate Planning
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
For purposes of aggregate production smoothing, quadratic functions often produce good fits to data on some of the relevant incremental costs, such as inventory and overtime costs. However, when costs of hiring and laying off workers are described by smooth quadratic functions, the model solutions tend to involve very frequent minor workforce adjustments. Production managers are often unwilling to actually implement such decisions because changing workforce levels involves a great many intangible costs, many of which seem to defy meaningful analytic representation.

## 11. NoteA Note on Dynamic Programming with Unbounded Rewards
### Author(s):
- J. A. E. E. van Nunen
- J. Wessels
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Lippman presents sufficient conditions for Denardo's N-stage contraction in discounted semi-Markov decision processes with unbounded rewards. In this note it is demonstrated that Lippman's conditions may be replaced by weaker conditions which even imply 1-stage contraction. The verification of the conditions of this note is somewhat easier.

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1978
### Abstract:
The aim of this note is to add objectivity to the article by Van Gigch (Van Gigch, J. P. 1976. Planning for freedom. Management Sci.22 (9, May).). The main points are that the four models of Van Gigch are historical stages of development, not options at a given point of time; and that the role of the elite is not an impartial one.
