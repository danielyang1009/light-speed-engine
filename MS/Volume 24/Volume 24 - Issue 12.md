## 2. Nevada's Gaming Revenues: Time Characteristics and Forecasting
### Author(s):
- Thomas F. Cargill

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
The growing interest in gaming activity has led to an increased interest in Nevada's economy. Gross gaming revenues are regarded as an important economic indicator of the Nevada economy and of considerable importance to the State's budgetary planning since taxes derived from these revenues represent almost fifty percent of the general revenues in any given year. The major objective of this study is to identify the time varying characteristics of quarterly gaming revenues over a twenty-year period for the three most important economic areas within Nevada. This will provide the basis for developing a meaningful forecasting methodology.

## 3. The Role of Attitude Toward Risk in Strictly Competitive Decision-Making Situations

### Published:

### Abstract:
The impact of decision makers' attitudes toward risk has been studied extensively in the context of noncompetitive decision making but not in the context of competitive decision making. In this paper we study the effects of the utility functions of the players in a strictly competitive decision-making situation on (a) their strategies and (b) their expected monetary payoffs. The setting is that of a two-by-two, two-person, zero-sum (in money) game with exponential utility functions for the competitors. The monetary payoffs and utility functions are assumed to be public knowledge. Combinations of utility functions that preserve the zero-sum condition as well as combinations that do not preserve this condition are considered. As might be expected, results from noncompetitive decision making do not necessarily carry over into competitive situations. For example, an increase in the risk aversion of a player may actually increase that player's expected monetary payoff because of altered strategies on the part of the competitor. In general, the effects of nonlinear utility functions on a player's strategy and expected monetary payoff depend on the player's utility function, the opponent's utility function, and the relationship among the entries in the payoff table. Furthermore, it does not appear possible to express this dependence in the form of simple rules of thumb, although the results presented here indicate the direction of movement of strategies and expected payoffs as the inputs to the problem are varied in certain systematic ways.

## 4. Production Switching Heuristics for the Aggregate Planning Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
A number of approaches to the aggregate planning problem have been proposed in the literature, yet experience suggests that industrial concerns seldom use these models in actual planning situations. This paper describes a modified random walk production-inventory heuristic for the problem which should appeal to managers on the basis of simplicity as well as efficiency. The proposed approach is contrasted with linear programming, parametric programming, and linear decision rule optimal and near optimal solutions for several well known production situations. The simple production switching heuristic produces schedules which exceed optimal schedules by only 1 to 2 percent of total production costs in all cases.

## 5. Jointly Optimal Sales Commissions for Nonincome Maximizing Sales Forces
### Author(s):
- Charles B. Weinberg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
In a multiproduct sales force, it has previously been shown that a commission structure based on equal fractions of each product's realized gross margin is jointly optimal if the sales force's goal is to maximize (expected) income and products are independent. Jointly optimal means that the sales force, which is presumed to be best able to estimate customer response to sales force activities, will simultaneously act to optimize its own objective and maximize corporate earnings. In this paper, it is shown that an equal gross margin commission system is also jointly optimal when products are interdependent and when the sales force does not have a goal of income maximization but has other objectives, such as minimizing time to reach a certain income goal or trading off time against money. Further, not all salespeople are required to have the same objective. For income maximizers an approach requiring less stringent assumptions than previously employed to show joint optimality is developed.

## 6. A Group Decision Process for Resource Allocation in the Health Setting
### Author(s):
- John G. Nackel
- Jay Goldman
- William L. Fairman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
A group decision process is developed that allocates an available budget to health programs based on program effectiveness. The program effectiveness is measured by comparing alternative programs (at various funding levels) with respect to the weighted objectives of the health care organization. The organizational objectives are weighted by a constant-sum paired comparisons scaling technique. An integer programming formulation allows the decision makers to maximize program effectiveness within the given budgetary, resource, regulatory, and program structure constraints. The Effectiveness Evaluation-Resource Allocation Process (ERAP) is validated by actual decision making teams testing four processes for resource allocation. An example from the validation experiment is presented to demonstrate the process.

## 7. Stochastic Dominance Without Transitive Preferences
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
Traditional definitions of stochastic dominance assume that the decision agent's preference-or-indifference relation on outcomes of risky decisions is transitive. This paper proposes a stochastic dominance relation for the comparison of risky decisions that is applicable to any complete and reflexive preference-or-indifference relation, or to any asymmetric preference relation. The new dominance relation possesses a number of intuitively desirable properties and is equivalent to the usual stochastic dominance relation when preferences are transitive.

### Abstract:
Introduction to the special issue devoted to police deployment. By publishing these four refereed papers together in one issue of Management Science, we have the dual purpose of presenting new substantive research results in an important public sector problem area and of attracting other management scientists to the area. The field is still relatively new for OR/MS professionals, and much work remains to be done.

## 9. A Patrol Car Allocation Model: Background
### Author(s):

- Peter Dormont
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
Before designing a computer program for allocating police patrol cars by time and geography, a review was undertaken of previously existing programs of this type. Nearly all of the programs calculated queuing statistics for the collection of patrol cars by assuming a steady-state system with calls for service arriving within priority levels according to Poisson processes and having independent, identical, exponentially distributed service times. Unavailabilities of patrol cars for reasons other than calls for service were handled in the models either by artificially increasing the arrival rate of calls or by assuming that the number of servers is smaller than the number of patrol cars. Some programs calculated additional performance measures such as travel times and preventive patrol frequencies. All the programs had the capabilities to describe performance statistics for an allocation proposed by the user, but they differed in their capabilities to prescribe desirable allocations. None of the programs had achieved general acceptance because each had virtues and inadequacies not present in the others.

## 10. A Patrol Car Allocation Model: Capabilities and Algorithms
### Author(s):
- Jan M. Chaiken
- Peter Dormont
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
A computer program has been designed for specifying the number of police patrol cars that should be on duty in each geographical command of a city at various times of day on each day of the week. It incorporates, by user option, nearly all the desirable features of earlier allocation programs, together with several improvements. It calculates performance statistics for the current allocation of patrol cars or any allocation proposed by the user. In addition, it has two prescriptive capabilities: (1) determining the minimum number of patrol cars needed during each tour in each command to meet specified constraints on performance measures, and (2) allocating a specified total number of car-hours by time and/or geography so as to optimize one of several available objective functions. The main technical innovation in the model is that it allows one tour in each day to overlay two other tours. A heuristic algorithm allocates car-hours when there is such an overlay tour; it is optimal when the overlay tour has the same duration as the tours it overlays.

## 11. Police Sector Design Incorporating Preferences of Interest Groups for Equality and Efficiency
### Author(s):
- Samuel E. Bodily
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
This paper proposes and illustrates by example a decision model for a resource allocation problem in urban managementthe design of service areas for police mobile units. Estimates of the performance of alternative designs are given by existing analytic models of spatially distributed emergency service systems. Using multiattribute utility theory, alternatives are evaluated according to the preferences for efficiency and equality of service of three interest groups: citizens, police, and administrators. Meaningful measures of inequality are developed and an algorithm is created for generating improved sector designs.

## 12. An Algorithm for Deploying a Crime Directed (Tactical) Patrol Force
### Author(s):
- Kenneth Chelst
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1978
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for deploying a crime directed patrol force. The optimization problem is formulated as the allocation of N patrol among R high crime regions so as to maximize the weighted probability of a patrol intercept of a crime. The algorithm has full sensitivity analysis capabilities. This capability is critical because the model's input parameters include (1) crime weights, which in general will have a subjective component, (2) crime descriptive data, which are difficult to estimate, and (3) crime frequency data, which are likely to change with time. The paper presents an illustrative application of the algorithm. The resultant allocation is compared to a strategy which allocates patrol units in direct proportion to each region's total crime rate. The optimal allocation significantly increased the probability of an intercept.
