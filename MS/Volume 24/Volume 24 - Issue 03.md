## 1. A Feedback Model for Automated Real Estate Assessment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
Pressing changes are needed in the administration of real estate taxation that will not only ensure that all properties be assessed accurately and equitably, but will enable taxpayers to perceive that they are being treated fairly. In this paper, we examine what properties an automated mass appraisal system should exhibit so as to meet efficacy, equity and public acceptability criteria. A new automated system designed on the basis of these properties which utilizes feedback control and pattern recognition concepts is presented. Results of an empirical study using Pittsburgh data supports the feasibility of the proposed system.

## 2. Planning and Dynamic Control of Projects under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- John M. Burt
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of planning and controlling (through resource allocation decisions) projects under conditions of uncertainty. Particular attention is given to the dynamic reallocation of resources over the duration of projects as information about actual activity times becomes known. The effect of resource allocations on an activity is represented, by modifications in the probability function of the time to process that activity. Analytic procedures such as dynamic programming and distribution analysis, which might lead to optimal dynamic decision rules, are shown to be computationally intractable even for very small problems. For a set of project networks of relatively simple structure, the efficacy of several heuristic decision rules is tested via simulation. The results of these simulation studies indicate some general concepts that should be applicable to the management of larger, more realistic, projects.

## 3. Classification for Market Segmentation: An Improved Linear Model for Solving Problems of Arbitrary Origin
### Author(s):
- William R. Darden
- William D. Perreault, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
A current problem in marketing research involves the use of scale measures of consumer characteristics to develop homogeneous classifications of consumers. The quality of these classification efforts is influenced by the nature of the scales, which are frequently characterized by arbitrary origin and variance. This paper draws on recent developments in classification methodology to propose and illustrate an integrative classification methodology which overcomes some of the current problems of classification approaches.

## 4. Assessment of Alternative Management Forms in Academic Interdisciplinary Research Projects
### Author(s):
- Philip H. Birnbaum
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
Interdisciplinary research projects in academic institutions are classified using cluster analysis on their structural properties of size, stability of membership, number of hierarchical levels, division of labor, and the proportion of professional staff with doctoral degrees, masters degrees but not doctorates, and bachelors degrees but neither a masters degree nor a doctoral degree. Within each type, management actions such as time spent planning and assembling resources together with task and relationship oriented behaviors were evaluated for differences between high and low performing projects within each structural type and across types in order to identify those which enhance effective performance. Large stable projects with highly educated personnel performed best. Leaders who exhibited task oriented behaviors had higher performing projects regardless of structural type. Findings that time spent planning interdisciplinary research is not associated with higher performance are different from previous findings for noninterdisciplinary research.

## 5. Multi-Attribute Investment Decisions: A Study of R&D Project Selection
### Author(s):
- S. L. Schwartz
- I. Vertinsky
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
In evaluating R&D opportunities executives make tradeoffs among three classes of attributes: commitment of resources, expected payoff, and risk. The focus of this study of Canadian top executives and R&D managers is the investigation of these tradeoffs and how they differ among executives and industries. On the basis of judgments of sixty hypothetical projects, alternative individual and group models were estimated using regression and discriminant analysis procedures. The results indicate that linear models provide good fit with observations of R&D investment judgments and that differences in tradeoffs between risk and rates of return can be related to the characteristics of the executives and their work environments. This information is useful for predicting R&D investment portfolios in an environment of changing opportunities.

## 6. Production Smoothing Under Piecewise Concave Costs, Capacity Constraints and Nondecreasing Requirements
### Author(s):
- M. G. Korgaonker
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
The production smoothing problem with known demands that are assumed to increase with time is treated. The production and inventory costs are concave. The cost of increasing production from one period to the next is a concave function of the increase; similarly, the cost of decreasing production is a concave function of the decrease. Backlogging is not permitted. In each period, a fixed production capacity that does not vary with time is available. The problem it similar to that discussed by Zangwill, except for the important difference of capacity constraint.

## 7. A Modified Benders' Partitioning Algorithm for Mixed Integer Programming
### Author(s):
- Dale McDaniel
- Mike Devine
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
As applied to mixed-integer programming, Benders' original work made two primary contributions: (1) development of a pure integer problem (Problem P) that is equivalent to the original mixed-integer problem, and (2) a relaxation algorithm for solving Problem P that works iteratively on an LP problem and a pure integer problem. In this paper a modified algorithm for solving Problem P is proposed, in which the solution of a sequence of integer programs is replaced by the solution of a sequence of linear programs plus some (hopefully few) integer programs. The modified algorithm will still allow for taking advantage of any special structures (e.g., an LP subproblem that is a network problem) just as in Benders' original algorithm. The modified Benders' algorithm is explained and limited computational results are given.

## 8. Independence and Calibration in Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- J. Michael Harrison
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
An individual is said to be potentially miscalibrated if he is not sure whether his future subjective probability assessments will agree with observed frequency. Alternately, the individual is said to be uncertain about his own calibration. It is argued that such a person will never perceive any two events as (probabilistically) independent, in the same sense that an ignorant person does not perceive events as certain. Uncertainty about one's own calibration does not prevent rational behavior in the decision theoretic sense, but it may make much more difficult the process of translating decision theoretic principles into practical procedures for analysis of real decision problems.

## 9. Assessing the Impact of Market Disturbances Using Intervention Analysis
### Author(s):
- Dean W. Wichern
- Richard H. Jones
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
A recurring problem confronting marketing operatives at all levels is assessing the impact of market disturbances. The disturbances may be caused by marketing mix manipulations of the firm itself, by its competitors or by fundamental external changes in the environment in which the firm operates. This article discusses a technique, intervention analysis, by which the impact of such disturbances can be assessed. The technique is used to examine the effects of Proctor and Gamble's promotion of the American Dental Association endorsement of Crest on the market shares of Crest and Colgate dentifrice during the years 19581963.

## 10. An Approximation to Queueing Systems with Interruptions
### Author(s):
- M. J. Fischer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
Queueing systems with interruptions serve as models for a variety of situations occurring in every day life. Usually, for each type of interruption, a separate queueing analysis is required. In this paper we present a single queueing model which can be used to analyze many such systems. The model is in the form of an approximation that is based upon several parameters, which reflect the particular queueing system under consideration. Applications to queueing systems with priorities and breakdowns are given in the paper.

## 11. Modeling Facility Location Problems as Generalized Assignment Problems
### Author(s):

- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1977
### Abstract:
A variety of well-known facility location and location-allocation models are shown to be equivalent to, and therefore solvable as, generalized assignment problems (GAP's). (The GAP is a 0-1 programming model in which it is desired to minimize the cost of assigning n tasks to a subset of m agents. Each task must be assigned to one agent, but each agent is limited only by the amount of a resource, e.g., time, available to him and the fact that the amount of resource required by a task depends on both the task and the agent performing it.) The facility location models considered are divided into public and private sector models. In the public sector, both p-median and capacity constrained p-median problems are treated (In the p-median problem exactly p of n sites must be selected to provide service to all n. Each site has an associated weight, e.g., its population, and it is desired to minimize the weighted average distance between the n sites and their respective service sites. The capacity constrained p-median problem differs only in that there is an upper limit on the sum of the weights of the sites served by each service site.) In the private sector we consider both capacitated and uncapacitated warehouse location problems in which each customer's demands must be satisfied by a single warehouse. In addition, we show how certain types of constraints limiting the site and capacity combinations allowed can be incorporated into these models through their treatment as GAP's. An existing algorithm for the GAP is modified to take advantage of the special structure of these facility location problems, and computational results are reported.
