## 1. Incorporating Exogenous Factors in Adaptive Forecasting of Hospital Census
### Author(s):
- Edward P. C. Kao
- Frank M. Pokladnik
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the use of a recursive discounted least squares model for forecasting daily hospital census. We show, by means of a case study, how one can incorporate, with a minimum amount of cost and effort, institutional and exogenous factors explicitly into the model so as to enhance its forecast accuracy. These factors include holidays, capacity changes, and other events known to affect occupancies. The forecast modification comprises direct adjustments of model parameters, and judicious control of parameter updatings.

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
This paper describes a multiobjective decision analysis performed to assist in selecting the conductor, tower size, and number of subconductors per bundle for a proposed 765 kV transmission line. Multiobjective decision analysis is shown to provide a systematic, logical framework for handling uncertainty and multiple objectives in this problem.

## 3. An Algorithm for the Dynamic Lot-Size Problem with Time-Varying Production Capacity Constraints
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Baker
- Paul Dixon
- Michael J. Magazine
- Edward A. Silver
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
We consider the situation of a single item having a deterministic, time-varying demand pattern. Production lot sizes, so as to minimize the total of setup and carrying costs, are to be determined subject to production capacity restrictions that can vary with time. Two important theorems concerning properties of the optimal solution are exploited in developing a tree search algorithm. In addition, other properties are utilized to reduce the amount of search necessary. Results of extensive tests are presented and discussed.

## 4. Priority Ranking and Consensus Formation
### Author(s):
- Wade D. Cook
- Lawrence M. Seiford
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the problem of combining ordinal preferences, expressed as priority vectors, to form a consensus. An axiomatic structure relating to the concept of distance between rankings is developed, uniqueness of the distance measure is proven and its form derived. Adopting the median ranking as a form of consensus, it is shown that this ranking can be determined, in the case of complete rankings, by solving a certain assignment problem. The results are compared and contrasted to earlier work due to Arrow, Kendall, Kemeny and Snell, and Bogart.

## 5. Optimal Aggregation of Multi-Item Production Smoothing Models
### Author(s):
- G. J. Gaalman
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for aggregating multi-item versions of the HMMS model. Necessary conditions are used to reduce the multi-item model to a one-item model. The aggregation technique makes use of the structural properties of the inventory-production part of the model and can be performed regardless the structure of the work force-total production part. Disaggregation of the optimal decisions of the aggregated model gives the optimal decisions of the multi-item model.

## 6. Municipal Resource Allocation: Minimizing the Cost of Fire Protection
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
Municipal decision-makers face the difficult task of determining the amount of funds to be allocated for fire department services. This decision affects both the insurance class of the city and the total cost of fire protection. Total fire protection cost is the sum of the tax dollars spent for fire department services (public expenditures) and fire insurance premiums paid by residents and businesses (private expenditures). This paper presents an integer programming model to minimize the sum of these two costs. Since insurance costs reflect only property losses the model does not explicitly include the consequences of loss of life or injury. Since the protection of persons is an important part of the fire protection mission it is important to realize that the model produces a lower bound for the value and level of fire department services. We go on to show how the results can be used to provide a method of inputing a life hazard benefit for decisions which produce more fire protection than suggested by the cost-minimizing model. The model was applied in Boulder, Colorado; the ways in which the results may be incorporated into the political decision process are also described.

## 7. NoteOn Optimal Resource Allocation in Community Hypertension Programs
### Author(s):
- Roken Ahmed
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
In Management Science (Vol. 24, No. 14, October, 1978), Nichols and Weinstein describe a model of a hypertension detection and treatment program, in which individuals proceed through a series of stages with transition probabilities that depend on expenditures at each stage. We generalize the model to include the case where the number of persons in the first stage is a decision variable. Surprisingly, this more general model is simpler to solve since it is shown that optimal transition probabilities and expenditures at any stage do not depend on probabilities and expenditures at later stages. The result is applied to simple cost functions fitted to data from the numerical example of Nichols and Weinstein. We also consider a more general form of the objective function, and present an algorithm for solving the resulting optimality conditions.

## 8. NoteA New Approach to Urban Modelling
### Author(s):
- John F. Brotchie
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
This note describes a different approach to urban modelling, resulting in a new, more general form of model. The model can be used for prediction, prescription, explanation, or evaluation; or to distinguish between the objectives of individuals, the planning authority, and the community. It is utility maximizing, and also entropy maximizing, and includes diversity of activities in zones. It relates land use and transport decisions and allows dispersal of urban activities to be analysed.

## 10. NoteSingle and Double Vertex Substitution in Heuristic Procedures for the p-Median Problem
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
- Roberto D. Galvo
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
The p-median problem is an uncapacitated minisum network location problem where it is required to site p facilities in a network, so that the sum of the shortest distances from each of the nodes of the network to its nearest facility is minimized. An existing heuristic procedure for this problem is extended, and computational experience is provided for several cases. A simple vertex addition heuristic and its use as a pre-processor to the extended procedure is described and tested for a number of problems.

## 11. NoteComments on Single Cycle Continuous Review Policies for Arborescent Production/Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
In the paper by Graves and Schwarz [Graves, Stephen C., Leroy B. Schwarz. 1977. Single cycle continuous review policies for arborescent production/inventory systems. Management Sci.23 (5, January) 529540.], we observed an error in their discussion of optimal policies for the one warehouse-m retailer system. Specifically, Theorem 1, which states that the optimal stationary policy is a single-cycle policy, is incorrect.

## 13. NoteSensitivity to Distributions in Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Eliezer Naddor
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
The optimal decisions and costs of several inventory systems with the s, S policy are presented showing how they are affected by different distributions of demand, different shortage costs and different leadtimes. The numerical results seem to imply that in many cases the optimal decisions depend on the means and standard deviations of demand but not on the specific forms of the distributions.

### Abstract:
In the recent issue of Management Science Fox (Fox, B. 1978. Estimation and simulation. Management Sci.24 (8, April) 860861.) expressed doubts about the relevance of steady-state behavior. In a reply Schruben (Schruben, L. W. 1978. Reply to Fox. Management Sci.24 (8, April) 862.) disagreed on this point. With Fox he was in favor of publishing failures of variance reduction techniques (VRT's). I would like to add the following remarks.

### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1978
### Abstract:
In a recent article in Management Science, Savas [Savas, E. S. 1978. On equity in providing public services. Management Sci.24 (8, April) 800808.] discusses performance measures in the provision of public services, states that it is difficult, but not impossible, to develop measures for efficiency and effectiveness, and discusses some of the measures that have been used in various industries. It should be noted, however, that in some fields the widely used efficiency and effectiveness indicators do not measure what they are intended to, and should be subject to further critical examination.
