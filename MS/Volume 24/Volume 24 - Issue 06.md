## 1. The Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP): Review and Extensions
### Author(s):
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
The ELSP is a time-honored problem that has been around since 1915. It is the problem of accommodating cyclical production patterns when several products are made on a single facility. Recent contributions to its resolution resulted in either analytical approaches to a restricted problem, or heuristic approaches to the entire problem.

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
This paper describes a long-range planning procedure for administrators in private universities. The procedure operates by generating a sequence of alternative future configurations of the university that satisfy several financial constraints and by helping an administrator to assess his preferences on them. A mathematical programming algorithm is used to structure the interactive identification/search procedure. It incorporates the strategy of restriction and linear programming methods to generate new configurations, and it relies upon the interactively assessed preferences of the administrator to guide the search process rather than a standard objective function.

## 3. Pay Satisfaction: An Empirical Test of a Discrepancy Model
### Author(s):
- H. Jack Shapiro
- Mahmoud A. Wahba
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
Lawler's discrepancy model of pay satisfaction was tested to determine its viability as a predictor of pay satisfaction. An analysis of die data seems to indicate that a substantial portion of the model is not supported. Thirteen out of nineteen proposed variables tested were found to have little or no relationships with pay satisfaction. However, social comparison, wage history, status, actual pay, performance and job difficulty were found to have weak to moderately strong relationships with pay satisfaction. Implications for the design of reward systems in organizations are discussed.

## 4. Determining Reorder Points When Demand is Lumpy
### Author(s):
- J. B. Ward
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
Lumpy or sporadic demand patterns with highly skewed distributions are common in parts and supplies types of stockholdings, and much of available inventory control methodology is not appropriate for such items. This paper presents a simple, easily used regression model to calculate order points for lumpy items from knowledge of demand parameters and the desired service level. It is derived from the particular compound Poisson distribution commonly called stuttering Poisson. Results are derived and presented in the following framework, though application is not limited to these conditions. The control discipline is the order quantity, order point (Q, R) approach with continuous review. Lead time is assumed to be known and constant. An assigned service level is assumed based on fraction of demand supplied without backorder. Joint optimization of Q and R is not addressed, but rather order point is based on an independently calculated order quantity. Forecasting methods are not addressed, but the mean and variance of lead time demand forecasts are assumed available.

## 5. A Spatial Equilibrium Model for Evaluating Alternative Policies for Controlling Sediment from Agriculture
### Author(s):
- James C. Wade
- Earl O. Heady
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
A model for evaluating alternative sediment control policies in agriculture is formulated such that changes in the production of agricultural commodities among and within 105 agricultural production areas can be analyzed. The model combines the elements of spatial economic equilibrium with physical and technical aspects of cropland agriculture. Five alternative sediment control policies as might be formulated by national environment planning agencies are analyzed. The analysis of the alternative policies do not give a definitive solution to sediment water quality problems but rather provide significant information on technical, regional and cost distributions of agricultural production to help decision makers formulate national sediment control policies.

## 6. Stochastic Dynamic Location Analysis
### Author(s):
- Richard E. Rosenthal
- John A. White
- Donovan Young
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
This research introduces methods of stochastic decision processes into location analysis. The specific model concerns making dynamic relocation decisions for a new facility (server) that must interact with existing facilities (customers) whose relocations are stochastic processes. The model is an infinite-horizon Markov decision chain whose solution gives a server relocation policy that minimizes the expected discounted sum of costs. Costs are location-dependent and are incurred in two ways: when the server makes choice relocations and when the server interacts with customers. The model captures the essence of a variety of familiar dynamic location decision situations. Some methodological developments that allow solution of large problems are reported.

## 7. ARTS PLAN: A Model Based System for Use in Planning a Performing Arts Series
### Author(s):
- Charles B. Weinberg
- Kenneth M. Shachmut
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the application of marketing and management science to some of the problems involved in managing a series of performing arts presentations. Although some of the decisions are largely artistic and not subject to formal analytic procedures, many other decisions can be aided by model-based procedures. This paper describes some of the analytic procedures which are being used by the management of one performing arts series.

## 9. A Proxy Approach to Multi-Attribute Decision Making
### Author(s):
- Kenneth R. Oppenheimer
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
This paper combines two rival preference modeling techniques in a new approach to multi-attribute decision making. Currently existing multi-attribute procedures use either global or local preference modeling. In the global modeling technique, a single preference function is constructed in the large; its maximum is the optimal alternative. In the local procedure, sequential approximations of the preference function are constructed in the small. Each approximation generates a trial solution. Under suitable conditions, each trial solution is preferred to its predecessor, so the trial sequence eventually reaches the optimum. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages; this paper combines the desirable features of both techniques in a new improved method. This new method, called the proxy approach, uses the advantages of one technique to overcome the disadvantages of the other. This paper first develops the theoretical aspects of the proxy approach and then compares it to existing procedures. Finally, the proxy algorithm is applied to a curriculum planning problem and numerous insights are gained.

## 10. Forecasting the Product of Two Time Series with a Linear Asymmetric Error Cost Function
### Author(s):
- Steven D. Wood
- Bert M. Steece
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
Our objective is to present a methodology which minimizes the expected cost of predictive errors when: (a) predictions are obtained for the product of two separately attained but contemporaneous time series, and (b) a linear asymmetric error cost function reflects the costs associated with predictive errors. Integrated Autoregressive-Moving Average models characterize the two series. Each prediction is expressed as a quantile of the conditional distribution of the contemporaneous product of the two series (i.e., a quantile of the distribution of the product of two Gaussian random variables with nonzero means). An actually observed hospital food service demand problem exemplifies the procedure and utility of our methodology.

## 11. NoteOptimal Assignment of Customers in a Two Server Congestion System with No Waiting Room
### Author(s):
- Wayne Winston
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1978
### Abstract:
We consider a two server congestion system which is heterogeneous in the sense that the reward received depends on the match between server and customer. In particular, if a type s customer (s = 1, 2, 3, ) is assigned to server i (i = 1, 2) a reward Rst is earned. Service time is assumed to depend only on customer type. Upon arrival a customer must be assigned to a server, (if one is available) with all customers who find both servers occupied being turned away. The policy that maximizes the long-run expected reward earned over an infinite horizon is shown to depend on a single critical number. Applications to the deployment of fire engines and assignment of patients to coronary care units are briefly discussed.
