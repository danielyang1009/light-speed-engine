## 1. Forecasting Political Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
An applied procedure is preserved in this paper which has been used to forecast some of the political risks ars oil company faces from investment in an overseas developing country, e.g., expropriation, taxation, price and production controls. The procedure makes use of a panel of experts, but requires, their estimates to be formulated in a way that takes explicit account of the precursive conditions for each of the adverse actions that the host country could take. A Bayesian method is used to derive the composite probabilities, for the political risk events under consideration and a Cross-Impact Analysis then provides s means of overall scenario generation.

## 2. Models of New Product Diffusion Through Advertising and Word-of-Mouth
### Author(s):
- Joe A. Dodson, Jr.
- Eitan Muller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
A model of the diffusion process is developed which recognizes (1) the interaction between adopters and non-adopters and (2) the influence of external information sources such as advertising. The model is extended by incorporating the effects of repeat purchasing. The models written by the following authors are shown to be special cases of this model: Gould. Nerlove and Arrow, Vidale and Wolfe, Palda, Bass, Nicosia, and Glaister. The behavioral assumptions which support the model are made explicit and the implications of these assumptions for the shape of the new product growth curve are derived.

## 3. The Role of Team and Task Characteristics in R&D Team Collaborative Problem Solving and Productivity
### Author(s):
- Robert C. Daley
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
Antecedents of collaborative problem solving in R&D teams have received little attention. Furthermore, the relationship between this form of problem solving and R&D team productivity remains unarticulated. This lacuna is addressed in the present study be analyzing the relationships between task and team, properties, collaborative problem solving and team productivity. Multiple regression was used to study the relationships among these variables. Results indicated that team cohesiveness and task certainty were robust predictors of collaborative problem solving and productivity for 45 R&D project groups. It was found that collaborative problem solving did not have a linear relationship with team productivity The collaborative problem solving-productivity relationship was further examined and it was shown that the relationship was sensitive to high and low levels for each of four predictors used in the research design (task certainty, task interdependence, team size, and team cohesiveness). These empirical findings were then translated into implications for R&D managers.

## 4. Innovation Diffusion in a Dynamic Potential Adopter Population
### Author(s):
- Vijay Mahajan
- Robert A. Peterson
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
Existing single-adoption diffusion models assume a static (constant) ceiling on the number of adopters, that is, a constant population of potential adopters, over the entire time frame of the diffusion process. However, for most innovations this assumption is tenuous. Rather, the ceiling, or the potential adopter population is more likely to be dynamic. The present paper relaxes this assumption and presents a dynamic diffusion model. To illustrate the application of this model, data from two innovations are analyzed.

## 5. Socially and Individually Optimal Control of Arrivals to a GI/M/1 Queue
### Author(s):
- Shaler Stidham, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
We study the problem of controlling the arrivals to a single-server queue with general interarrival-time distribution and exponential service-time distribution (a GI/M/1 system). Control is exercised by accepting or rejecting arriving customers or by charging entering customers a toll or entrance fee. An entering customer receives a reward, representing his utility of service. The rewards vary randomly from customer to customer. There is a holding cost, which is a convex function of the number of customers in the system. We compare socially and individually optimal entering policies when the decision horizon is finite, specifically, when the system must close after n future arrivals. There may be a terminal reward or cost, incurred as a function of the number of customers present at the end of the horizon, representing, for example, the holding cost incurred until all of them are served. We show that a socially optimal policy is less likely to accept a customer than an individually optimal policy, and both policies are less likely to accept as the number of customers already present increases, the horizon length increases, or the discount rate decreases. It is shown that, contrary to intuition, the optimal congestion toll cannot be monotonic in the number of customers present. These properties carry over to the infinite horizon, both with and without discounting, except that in the latter case, in which the criterion is long-run average net benefit, the toll can be monotonic. Implications for the study of rush-hour or peak-load phenomena in various congestion systems are briefly discussed.

## 6. A Simultaneous Equation Model of Corporate Strategy
### Author(s):
- Dan Schendel
- G. Richard Patton
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
Over the past decade strategy has become a concept of value to management as it relates the firm to the threats and opportunities of an increasingly turbulent environment. However, empirical tests of the validity of the strategy construct have been limited, as have been the managerial applications of the models used to test the construct. Early research efforts, both analytical and empirical, have shown that quantitative modeling of strategy could be a tool of value in helping top management achieve the goal is of the firm [Gershefski, George W. 1969. Building a corporate financial model. Harvard Business Rev. (JulyAugust) 6172; Guth, W. D. 1972. Product differentiation and concentration in the brewing industry. J. Business Policy.2 (3) 3136.]. Prior research has been limited to single equation models linking strategy and environment to only one performance goal, profitability. While there is some controversy about it, complex organizations set multiple, and sometimes conflicting goals, creating a need for models that car; encompass more than a single performance goal. Moreover, the interactive effects of strategic variables governing the efficiency of daily operations, suggests that single equation models of strategy cannot capture the complexity of the modern firm.

## 7. On a Production Allocation and Distribution Problem
### Author(s):
- Thomas G. Mairs
- Glenn W. Wakefield
- Ellis L. Johnson
- Kurt Spielberg
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
We describe a production allocation problem which was worked on at Frito-Lay and an integer programming model formulated for its solution. In connection with model formulation, we discuss estimation and collection of the required cost coefficients. Finally, we report on the use of two different linear programs, representing the same integer problem, which gave dramatically different running times to solve the integer programs. Some reasons for the improved running times are given.

### Author(s):
- Phillip Ein-Dor
- Eli Segev
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
This paper deals with strategic planning for management information systems. Specifically, those variables of the strategic plan which impact on the success or failure of MIS are identified, and propositions are formulated relating states of the variables to system conditions. The variables concerned are the system development strategy, the purpose of MIS, the priority scheme, functions assigned the system, goals, definitions of requirements and documentation of the strategic plan.

## 9. Priority Assignment of OSHA Safety Inspectors
### Author(s):
- Everett E. Adam, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
A priority assignment model for OSHA safety inspectors was developed and tested using 34,500 actual employee injuries from a total of 105,000 injuries in Missouri during 1973. The model combines expert opinions concerning selection of injury criteria and data from, reports of employee injuries. First the model computes a relative accident performance score for each employer. Employers are then grouped by general industrial classification and ranked according to their relative accident performance score. This worst-first ranking provides the rationale for assigning OSHA safety inspectors to employer locations. The model and research have been reviewed by Region VII OSHA personnel and implementation is currently under consideration within the Department of Labor. This model could replace current random assignment of inspectors in Missouri. Region VII, and the nation.

## 10. Probability Revision Under Act-Conditional States
### Author(s):
- Bertram Schoner
- J. K. Mann
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
This paper presents a simplified procedure to revise prior probabilities when these probabilities are conditional on acts. Moral hazard in insurance is one example where such conditions arise. Here coverage granted by the insurer may influence the probability of loss. The procedure developed in this paper permits evidence obtained from some experiment connected with one act to be employed in the revision of probabilities conditional not only on that act but on other acts as well. An example is presented and analyzed in which an insurance company must decide whether or not to grant full coverage to a medical group, based on evidence obtained from the claims history of that group under partial coverage.

## 11. Simulation of Decentralized Planning in Two Danish Organizations Using Linear Programming Decomposition
### Author(s):
- John Christensen
- Brge Obel
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
This paper describes the results of two studies where decentralized planning has been simulated. The coordination mechanisms employed were based on the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm, and the Ten Kate decomposition algorithm, which are price directive and budget directive planning procedures, respectively. The importance of the results is that the data and the structure of the two planning problems come from real organizationsa cooperative slaughterhouse and a forecast model for Danish agriculture. Thus conclusions based on using a price-directive and a budget-directive planning method to simulate decentralized planning in these organizations have relevance to the potential value of using such methods in real organizations. The main conclusions concern the importance of and the difficulties in finding good starting strategies for the two methods and the impact of the organizational structure on the rate of improvement for the methods.

## 12. On the Feasibility of Scheduling Lot Sizes for Two Products on One Machine
### Author(s):
- R. R. Vemuganti
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1978
### Abstract:
We are concerned with scheduling several products that, require processing or a single machine. Routine application of the economic lot size formula to each product separately, often yields an infeasiable schedule in the sense that there are times when it specifies simultaneous production of two or more products. Feasibility is guaranteed if a common cycle length (and thus equal set-ups per year per product) is chosen. However it is possible to find schedules by allowing variations in the number of set-ups among the products which cost less than the cost of the common cycle length schedule. In this paper we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the feasibility of scheduling two products, when the number of set-ups for each product are givers. Also a method of constructing the schedules is discussed.
