### Abstract:
The availability of data regarding variables of interest in forecasting problems is sometimes limited, but experts may possess a great deal of relevant information. The approach taken in this paper involves the development of adaptive forecasting models based on such information. Since the models and their parameters are difficult to consider intuitively, information from the experts is elicited in terms of predictive distributions of the variable to be forecasted. Various models can then be considered, and attempting to fit a model to the predictive distributions is analogous to attempting to fit a model to a set of observations. This general approach to forecasting is developed in this paper, and a specific model, a linear model with normally distributed errors, is considered in some detail. An actual application involving the forecasting of fatigue life of asphalt pavements illustrates the development of forecasting models from experts predictive distributions.

## 2. Optimization of the Arbitrage Process in Advance Refunding of Municipal Bonds
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
States, municipalities, and other regional or local public bodies have the authority to issue debt securities, the interest on which is tax exempt under federal regulations. As a consequence, the interest which these entities must pay on their bonds is usually below the rate on U.S. government securities of identical maturity. Arbitrage bondsissued by a municipality to take advantage of this differentialare not generally permitted, with the exception of Advance Refunding. Advance Refunding is the process by which the proceeds of a municipal bond issue are invested in Treasury securities and these securities placed in a trust fund to pay when due the principal and interest on debt previously outstanding. To limit the arbitrage profit to the municipality engaging in Advance Refunding, the U.S. government has strictly limited the amount of the new issue which may be invested at a yield rate greater than the rate obtained on the new municipal debt. This article, after discussing the appropriate government regulations, provides a simple example of Advance Refunding and a theoretical analysis of a simple refunding scheme. It then describes a two stage optimization procedure which will maximize the savings to the municipality which chooses to Advance Refund its debt. Results of this new procedure, which first minimizes the amount of Treasury securities and then provides an optimal maturity schedule for the new debt, are compared with actual refundings using other programs.

## 3. A Model for Planning Ambulatory Health Services
### Author(s):
- Peter T. Ittig
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
This paper reports results of a study that develops improved methods of planning ambulatory health services for a specified population. Some of the difficulties of the problem are discussed and a linear model is presented that aids the planning process by accounting for a wide range of data on the population, finances, and system dynamics. Sample results are shown and some implications for further research are discussed.

## 4. Algoristics for Single-Machine Sequencing with Precedence Constraints
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Morton
- Bala Ganga Dharan
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
Although Horn, Sidney and Lawler have considered the problem of minimizing weighted mean flow time for n jobs with precedence constraints on one machine, practical exact algorithms for the general case remain elusive. Two relatively sophisticated heuristics are presented which are computationally attractive. Each is optimal on large subclasses of problems; computational study demonstrates each to be extremely close to optimal in general. Such heuristics are dubbed algoristics. The first-come first-served heuristic serves as a benchmark. Finally, a simple myopic heuristic produces about 80% of the savings of the algoristics; it possesses the advantages of a dispatching rule. A standard branch and bound procedure has also been computed for a large subset of problems for comparison purposes. Planning horizon results are also derived.

## 5. An Approach to Solving Multiple Criteria Macroeconomic Policy Problems and an Application
### Author(s):
- Hannele Wallenius
- Jyrki Wallenius
- Pentti Vartia
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper we propose an approach to solving multiple criteria macroeconomic policy problems and report on an application using an existing econometric model. This approach involves the use of a mathematical programming formulation of the macroeconomic policy problem with multiple objective functions. The multiple objectives are resolved by a man-machine interactive solution strategy. This approach was implemented in order to analyze macroeconomic problems in Finland.

## 6. A Spike Collective Dynamic Factorization Algorithm for the Simplex Method
### Author(s):
- Richard D. McBride
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
A dynamic factorization algorithm is developed which uses a partition of the basis to permit the simplex method to be executed from a small working inverse and a small, sparse triangular submatrix of the basis. This partition is maintained dynamically using spike swapping in a way which seeks to keep the size of the working inverse as small as possible.

## 7. Predicting Demand from Sales Data in the Presence of Stockouts
### Author(s):
- William E. Wecker
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
The effect of stockouts on prediction accuracy is analyzed. The forecasting bias that results and the effect on the prediction error variance are explored and are seen to depend on the frequency of stockouts, the coefficient of variation of demand, and the serial correlation of demand.

## 8. The Value of Data for a Quadratic Decision Problem
### Author(s):
- Thomas Richard Rice
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
A question that recurs in the decision analysis literature is: What is the value of additional data gathering? We use a very general definition of data that includes subjective probability distributions provided by experts, calculations from models, and traditional experimental data. General expressions for the expected value of data have little practical use because they involve probability distributions whose arguments are themselves probability distributions. The traditional approach to alleviate the problem of dimensionality is to introduce arbitrary parameterization of the data.

## 9. Organizational Context and the Success of Management Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Phillip Ein-Dor
- Eli Segev
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
This paper identifies the organizational context variables affecting the success and failure of MIS. The variables are categorized as uncontrollable, partially controllable and controlled, and a conceptual scheme is suggested. In addition, current information on these variables and the interactions between them is surveyed; propositions are stated concerning relationships between the variables and the success or failure of MIS.

## 10. A Production-Inventory Control Model with a Mixture of Back-Orders and Lost-Sales
### Author(s):
- B. T. Doshi

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
We consider a production-inventory control model of finite capacity, in which backordering up to a certain level is allowed. We assume that there exist two possible production rates. The control is based on two critical stock-levels and prescribes to change the production rate used only when one of these levels is reached. A fixed cost is associated with every switch-over. The rate at which customers arrive and the distribution of the demand of an arriving customer depend on the production rate used at that moment. A formula for the long-run average expected costs per unit time is obtained as a function of the chosen critical levels. From this formula we derive expressions for various interesting operating characteristics of this system, amongst which are the joint stationary distribution of the processes describing the production rate used and the inventory of the system and the average number of switch-overs and lost-sales per unit time.

## 11. NoteOn the Validity of the Analytic-Heuristic Instrument Utilized in The Minnesota Experiments
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Zmud
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
The results of this study indicate that the aspect of cognitive style addressed in the Minnesota experiments may pertain to a decision maker's choice of a planned or spontaneous solution strategy. Whether or not such a characterization is equivalent to an analytic-heuristic classification is beyond the scope of this note. It would appear that the analytic-heuristic cognitive dimension is a richer and more robust construct. Any MIS/cognitive style implications from the Minnesota experiments should therefore probably not be extended beyond the planned vs. spontaneous dichotomy that is apparently provided via the AHQ.

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1978
### Abstract:
Zmud [Zmud, R. W. On the validity of the analytic-heuristic instrument utilized in The Minnesota Experiments. Management Sci. (this issue).] has raised some important questions about the interpretation of the cognitive style results reported in The Minnesota Experiments [Dickson, G. W., J. A. Senn, N. L. Chervany. 1977. Research in management information systems: the Minnesota experiments. Management Sci.23 (May) 913923.]. His specific challenges are (1) the cognitive style instrument used in The Minnesota Experiments did not measure the full breadth of the analytic-heuristic dimension of cognitive style and (2) research studies must report instrument reliability and validity data to aid the reader in interpreting the results.
