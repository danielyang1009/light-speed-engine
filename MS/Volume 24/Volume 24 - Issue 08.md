## 1. Administrative Experimentation: A Methodology for More Rigorous Muddling Through
### Author(s):
- Victor N. Berlin
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
Administrative experimentation is described as a more rigorous approach to the muddling through style of managerial decision making. It includes a class of heuristics for obtaining feedback on management decisions in what amounts to a continuous trial and error process. A manager on his own, a manager-consultant team, or a manager-researcher team can implement these heuristics in a variety of settings to serve a variety of purposes. A case study describing one application of this approach is presented.

## 2. On Equity in Providing Public Services
### Author(s):
- E. S. Savas
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
The performance of public services is determined to a large extent by the spatial distribution of facilities and resources that provide the service. Three measures of performance are discussed: efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. The last of these, equity, is recognized as being of growing importance, but has been generally neglected by management scientists.

## 3. Winning Strategies for Wagering on National Football League Games
### Author(s):
- Roger C. Vergin
- Michael Scriabin
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
An attempt was made to develop profitable strategies for betting on National Football League games. The research was based on the hypothesis that biases exist in the setting of pointspeads and that these biases can be detected and used for profitable wagering. An analysis of 19691974 data suggests that biases of several types do exist and that they are of sufficient magnitude to allow profitable betting strategies despite the normal five percent betting fee.

## 4. Deterministic Inventory Lot Size ModelsA General Root Law
### Author(s):
- Lineu C. Barbosa
- Moshe Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
The article presents a continuous time inventory model with known time varying demand. The relevant costs are the carrying and replenishment costs; backlogs are prohibited, replenishments are instantaneous, and the planning horizon is finite and known, The problem is to find the optimal schedule of replenishments, i.e., their number and the schedule of time intervals between consecutive orders. A complete solution is given for demand functions of the type b(t) = ktr, k > 0, r > 2, where t stands for time, and the asymptotic properties of the solution when the planning horizon tends to infinity are investigated. For r = 0 the solution reduces to the results obtained by Carr and Howe for the constant demand case with finite horizons, and to the classical square root law for infinite horizons. For r = 1 it yields the cubic root law given by Resh, Friedman, and Barbosa for time proportional demand rate. More generally, for r integer the solution can be expressed in an (r + 2) root law.

## 5. Testing Bowman's Managerial Coefficient Theory Using a Competitive Gaming Environment
### Author(s):
- William Edward Remus
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper Bowman's managerial coefficient theory is evaluated in a competitive environment, the Executive Game. The literature on Bowman's theory is surveyed and a review is made to justify using games to test decision theories. The experimental data reveal that decision rules fit the data well. Erratic and biased decision making is found to be a linear function of rank. Learning consistent with oligopolistic theory is found to occur. The applicability of Bowman's theory in competitive environment is established and the theory extended.

## 6. Teaching Dynamic Feedback Systems Thinking: An Elementary View
### Author(s):
- Nancy Roberts
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
A pilot study has demonstrated that dynamic feedback systems concepts can be taught to children as young as ten and eleven years old, when nurtured by a teaching strategy that follows Bruner's emphasis upon the teaching of basic structures [Bruner, J. S. 1963. The process of education. Vintage Books, New York.]. Focusing on the understanding and representation of underlying structures in the area of social studies, the author developed, implemented and evaluated a curriculum to teach children both to read dynamic feedback systems causal-loop diagrams and also to develop feedback diagrams explaining causal relationships among variables discussed in written materials. The curriculum enabled fifth and sixth grade children to learn analytic and synthesis skills previously taught primarily to graduate classes at M.I.T. The positive results achieved seem transferable to broader groups wishing to become familiar with dynamic feedback systems thinking and its applicability to social problems.

## 7. An Appraisal of the Empirical Performance of the Linear Decision Rule for Aggregate Planning
### Author(s):
- Leroy B. Schwarz
- Robert E. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
More than twenty years after the publication of the Linear Decision Rule (LDR) of Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (HMMS), the LDR remains an implementation failure. No company is reported to be using it. This paper hypothesizes that the reason for this failure may be a very simple one: the incremental benefit of aggregate planning (i.e., the coordinated optimization of aggregate work force, production, and inventory) over improved aggregate inventory management alone may be quite small. To demonstrate our hypothesis we reexamine the original paint company cost comparisons presented by HMMS, and show that virtually all of the LDR's reported saving over paint company management could have been obtained with a one time adjustment in management's aggregate buffer inventory level. We conclude that although the LDR might provide significantly larger savings than improved aggregate inventory management alone, published empirical results fail to demonstrate that potential. The implications of our hypothesis and conclusions are discussed.

## 8. Unnetworks, with Applications to Idle Time Scheduling
### Author(s):
- John J. Bartholdi, III
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
Integer linear programs with 0-1 constraint matrices arise frequently in scheduling and staffing models. For many such problems it is natural to model processor availability by columns of the constraint matrix, where 1's indicate processor availability for production and 0's indicate idle periods. Efficiently solvable problems have generally been identified in terms of special patterns of 1's within the matrix. Exploiting the fact that idle time is the complement of production time, we identify classes of problems that are efficiently solvable because of special patterns of 0's. In particular, several interesting idle-time scheduling problems are shown to be solvable as finite and bounded series of network flow or matching problems.

## 9. CommunicationsA Comment on Geometric Mean Portfolios
### Author(s):
- Donald C. Aucamp
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
In a recent paper in this journal [Vander Weide, J. H., D. W. Peterson, S. F. Maier. 1977. A strategy which maximizes the geometric mean return on portfolio investments. Management Sci.23(June) 11171123.], Vander Weide, Peterson, and Maer (WPM) incorrectly point out several of the properties of the portfolio strategy which maximizes the geometric mean return (GMR), in which the GMR strategy is equivalent to maximizing the expected logarithm of the total return (including principal). Specifically, they state that GMR portfolios maximize the probability of exceeding a given wealth level in a fixed amount of time. This is clearly not true.

## 11. Estimation and Simulation
### Author(s):
- Bennett Fox
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
A number of papers on estimation procedures for simulation have been published in Management Science and related journals. I believe that many of these are on the wrong track. The purpose of this letter is to indicate what appear to be shortcomings in this literature and to suggest (imperfect) remedies.

## 14. NoteOn Echelon Holding Costs
### Author(s):
- Leroy B. Schwarz
- Linus Schrage
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
The authors are indebted to Professor Andrew Szendrovits of McMaster University for pointing out that [Szendrovits, A. Z. A comment on Optimal and system myopic policies for production/inventory assembly systems. Management Science, this issue.] the definition of echelon holding cost in [Schwarz, L. B., L. Schrage. 1975. Optimal and system myopic policies for multi-echelon production/inventory systems. Management Sci.21 (11, July) 12851294.] does not relate the echelon holding cost rate at a stage to the more familiar explicit holding cost rate at a stage. As he indicates, if the relation between these two holding costs is not made explicit, a user might mistakenly use incorrect echelon rates. We give here an explicit relationship between stage and echelon rates, and prove that they give equivalent expressions for holding cost.

## 15. NoteAn Efficient Goal Programming Algorithm Using Constraint Partitioning and Variable Elimination
### Author(s):
- Jeffrey L. Arthur
- A. Ravindran
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
An efficient algorithm for solving linear goal programming problems using partitioning and elimination procedures is presented. The algorithm takes advantage of the definition of ordinal preemptive factors in the objective function inherent in most goal programming formulations. Preliminary results indicate that the partitioning algorithm is superior to the existing methods for solving goal programming problems.

## 16. NoteAn Improved Algorithm for the Stationary Cost Dynamic Lot Size Model with Backlogging
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Morton
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1978
### Abstract:
For the important special case that costs are linear and stationary over time, an improved algorithm is presented for the dynamic lot size model with backlogging which is comparable in difficulty to the standard no-backlogging algorithm. Planning horizon procedures analogous to those given by Lundin-Morton and Blackburn-Kunreuther are also developed. The results are also generalized to the concave cost case.
