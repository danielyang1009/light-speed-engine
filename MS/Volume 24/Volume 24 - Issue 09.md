## 1. Price Sensitive Consumer Demands in Energy ModelingA Quadratic Programming Approach to the Analysis of Some Federal Energy Agency Policies
### Author(s):
- C. Roger Glassey
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
A 21 sector input-output model of the 1972 U.S. economy is extended to include consumer demands, imports, and exports as endogenous variables, and used to analyze some consequences of the price control policy adopted to mitigate the impact of the quadrupling of world crude oil prices in 19731974. It is assumed that household consumption of goods is linearly related to prices. An equilibrium of the model economy is then computed by solving a quadratic program. It is shown that the price control policy is equivalent to subsidizing imported oil with revenues from a tax on domestic crude production. Equilibria are computed under this policy and in its absence. The comparison indicates the policy was effective in reducing the price index increase and GNP reduction that would otherwise have occurred, but at the cost of adversely affecting the balance of payments.

## 2. The Process and Product of System Design
### Author(s):
- Richard J. Boland, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
Given that user involvement is important in system design, this study addresses the as yet unexplored question of how a user should be involved in the system design process. Two radically different processes of interaction between a systems designer and a manager were compared in an information system design exercise.

## 3. (s, S) Policies Under Continuous Review and Discrete Compound Poisson Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
We consider inventory policies for a continuous review system with discrete compound Poisson demand, convex holding-penalty cost and fixed order cost. Beckmann has showri that under these conditions (s, S) policies are optimal. We develop recursive formulae to calculate the cost for any pair (s, S). Relations among s, S, S  s and the cost are produced that lead to an efficient determination of the optimal s and S. Tighter bounds are utilized than those obtained by Veinott and Wagner for the analogous case of periodic review. Sensitivity considerations are discussed.

## 4. NoteOptimal Recruitment Advertising
### Author(s):
- David Chappell
- David A. Peel
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
The optimal rules for the allocation of advertising expenditure when that expenditure affects the demand function facing the firm have been derived for a variety of processes and are relatively well known. The purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of advertising to include recruitment advertising. We study the optimal rules for the cases where recruitment advertising acts as a current or capital input and finally in a diffusion model where advertising influences the rate at which potential recruits become aware of the firm.

## 8. Archetypes of Strategy Formulation
### Author(s):
- Danny Miller
- Peter H. Friesen
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
There have been few attempts to understand the strategy making process by examining the organizational and environmental context in which it occurs. Rather than adopting the stance of contingency theorists who focus mainly on bivariate relationships, we decided to look for simultaneous associations among a fairly large number of variables. It was hoped that these variables would configure into models or archetypes which describe a series of different, though very frequently occurring modes or organizational failure and success. The methodology used to isolate archetypes is explained. Ten archetypes are described. Successful archetypes are: the adaptive firm under moderate challenge, the adaptive firm in a very challenging environment, the dominant firm, the giant under fire, the entrepreneurial conglomerate, and the innovator. Failure archetypes include: the impulsive firm, the stagnant bureaucracy, the headless giant, and the aftermath.

## 9. Patterns in Strategy Formation
### Author(s):
- Henry Mintzberg
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
The literature on strategy formation is in large part theoretical but not empirical, and the usual definition of strategy encourages the notion that strategies, as we recognize them ex post facto, are deliberate plans conceived in advance of the making of specific decisions. By defining a strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions, we are able to research strategy formation in a broad descriptive context. Specifically, we can study both strategies that were intended and those that were, realized .despite intentions. A research program suggested by this definition is outlined, and two of the completed studies are then reviewedthe strategies of Volkswagenwerk from 1934 to 1974 and of the United States government in Vietnam from 1950 to 1973. Some general conclusions suggested by these studies are then presented in terms of three central themes: that strategy formation can fruitfully be viewed as the interplay between a dynamic environment and bureaucratic momentum, with leadership mediating between the two forces; that strategy formation over time appears to follow some important patterns in organizations, notably life cycles and distinct change-continuity cycles within these; and that the study of the interplay between intended and realized strategies may lead us to the heart of this, complex organizational process.

## 10. Performance and Autonomy in Organizations: Determining Dominant Environmental Components
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
The formulation of a strategy for an organization begins with identifying the opportunities and risks in the environment. A full and permanent searchor scanningof all environmental forces is both too costly and intractable in terms of management time. Our findings indicate that managers do not try to identify all environmental forces. Identifying the dominant components of the environment focuses scanning efforts and saves energy and costs.

## 11. Strategic Choice as a Negotiated Outcome
### Author(s):
- Edwin A. Murray, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1978
### Abstract:
With increasing pressures for public accountability by private enterprise, the zone of strategic discretion for top level corporate managers is being reduced. Preliminary evidence from recent field research in a major electric utility showed that corporate plans of major strategic significance were not only formulated (within the company) but negotiated (implicitly if not explicitly) with external parties. To the extent that this phenomenon characterizes policy formation in corporations generally, conventional concepts of corporate strategy formulation as a rational comprehensive process are not descriptively accurate and perhaps not even as prescriptively useful as they might be.
