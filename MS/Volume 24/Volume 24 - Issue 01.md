## 1. Exceptional PaperDesign and Implementation of Large Scale Primal Transshipment Algorithms
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
A complete description is given of the design, implementation and use of a family of very fast and efficient large scale minimum cost (primal simplex) network programs. The class of capacitated transshipment problems solved is the most general of the minimum cost network flow models which include the capacitated and uncapacitated transportation problems and the classical assignment problem; these formulations are used for a large number of diverse applications to determine how (or at what rate) a good should flow through the arcs of a network to minimize total shipment costs. The presentation tailors the unified mathematical framework of linear programming to networks with special emphasis on data structures which are not only useful for basis representation, basis manipulation, and pricing mechanisms, but which also seem to be fundamental in general mathematical programming. A review of pertinent optimization literature accompanies computational testing of the most promising ideas. Tuning experiments for the network system, GNET, are reported along with important extensions such as exploitation of special problem structure, element generation techniques, postoptimality analysis, operation with problem generators and external problem files, and a simple noncycling pivot selection procedure which guarantees finiteness for the algorithm.

## 2. Optimization of Petroleum and Natural Gas ProductionA Survey
### Author(s):

- G. E. Slater
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
The paper surveys the literature dealing with the optimization of petroleum and natural gas production: Drilling, reservoir simulation, production planning and operations, enhanced recovery processes. Areas of possible future work are identified, such as optimal design and cost benefit studies of enhanced recovery projects. Problems are discussed which, in the authors' opinion, represent major obstacles in developing optimization models for production applications, for example, the nonlinearity and frequently large dimensions of the models, and the inherent uncertainties during the development phase of a field. Attention is also paid to the changing structure of the petroleum industry worldwide, which is shifting emphasis from traditional problems such as internal planning models to studies of new recovery processes, often labor-intensive and to be applied in small fields.

## 3. The Application of Behavioral and Philosophical Technologies to Strategic Planning: A Case Study of a Large Federal Agency
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
- Vincent P. Barabba
- Ralph H. Kilmann
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
This paper describes the results of a two-and-a-half year effort in proactive planning at the Bureau of the Census in Washington, D.C. Most large-scale organizations merely react to their future(s) instead of actively planning for and thus anticipating the future(s) they would like to bring about; would the Bureau be bold enough to try and break out of this pattern by engaging in what Ackoff and others have termed proactive or interactive planning? This paper not only describes the substantive results of the effort, but more importantly, the methodology that was utilized and developed to achieve those results.

## 4. A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Check Sorting
### Author(s):
- Frederic H. Murphy
- Edward A. Stohr
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
The motivation for this paper is a problem faced by banks which process large volumes of deposited checks. The checks must be separated by bank number before shipment to the Federal Reserve or other banks. The sorting is usually accomplished using a reader-sorter which reads the magnetic ink characters on the checks and separates them into different pockets. This paper characterizes the optimal sorting strategy and describes an efficient procedure for finding the optimal solution for problems of the size generally found in practice. The algorithm is based on a two state dynamic programming recursion in which characterization theorems are used to drastically reduce the size of the state space and in which the storage requirements are minimal. The paper includes an analysis of computational experience and describes how the algorithm can be used in a real time environment with deadlines.

## 5. A Diffusion Approximation Solution for a Repairman Problem with Two Types of Failure
### Author(s):
- D. P. Gaver
- J. P. Lehoczky
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
We propose a new type of repairman model in which failures may require multiple repair operations, each done by a specialized repair crew. These repair operations may occur simultaneously. An analysis of the model is carried out using diffusion approximation techniques. The analysis predicts that the number of customers in service will have a steady state normal distribution with specified mean and covariance structure. Numerical studies are presented which substantiate this assertion in the infinite server case. An analysis for the multiple server case is also provided.

## 6. On Ordering Perishable Inventory when Both Demand and Lifetime are Random
### Author(s):
- Steven Nahmias
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of ordering perishable inventory when there is uncertainty in both the demand and the lifetime of the product. Under the assumption that units outdate in the same order in which they enter inventory, it is shown that the structure of the optimal policy is essentially the same as in the case where the lifetime is deterministic. An explicit expression for the expected outdating of any order is derived. Two different bounds on the expected outdating are then used to construct two critical number approximations. Computations for a discrete version of the problem are performed to compare the expected costs of both approximations with the optimal. One approximation appeared to give slightly better results and produced an expected cost generally within a fraction of a percent of the optimal for the cases tested.

## 7. Heuristic 0-1 Linear Programming: An Experimental Comparison of Three Methods
### Author(s):
- Stelios H. Zanakis
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
This paper examines the performance of three heuristic methods (Senju-Toyoda, Kochen-berger et al. and Hillier) when applied to the 0-1 linear programming problem with nonnegative coefficients. Their effectiveness, measured in terms of computing time, error and relative error, is evaluated on a set of problems from the literature and randomly generated 0-1 test problems with nonnegative coefficients. Analysis of variance and stepwise regressions are employed to study the effect of the number of variables, number of constraints and degree of constraint slackness. The methods exhibited some similarities bui also marked differences in their behavior. Interestingly enough, the larger the number of variables the belter the accuracy of each method. Error differences among the three methods were significant (1:0.8:0.2) yet small (less than 2% on the average) for many practical situations. Hillier's algorithm was the most accurate but much slower and more core demanding than the other two, which makes it difficult or impossible to use for solving large 0-1 problems. Kochenberger's et al. heuristic was the fastest (most accurate) of the three in tightly (loosely) constrained problems. In general the Senju-Toyoda algorithm was the fastest, but least accurate on small and medium size problems. Suggestions are made for selecting the best heuristic based on the problem characteristics.

## 8. NoteEffects of Substituting a Linear Goal for a Fractional Goal in the Goal Programming Problem
### Author(s):
- Edward L. Hannan
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
In a recent article in Management Science, Awerbuch et al. [Awerbuch, S., J. G. Ecker, W. A. Wallace. 1976. A note: hidden nonlinearities in the application of goal programming. Management Sci.22 (8, April) 918920] discuss the occurrence of nonlinearities in the application of goal programming and conclude that direct linearization may not be possible when goal constraints are of a fractional nature.

## 9. NotePlant Layout: Computers Versus Humans
### Author(s):
- Denis R. Coleman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1977
### Abstract:
This work offers a critique of the methodology used by Scriabin and Vergin [Scriabin, Michael, Roger C. Vergin. 1975. Comparison of computer algorithms and visual based methods for plant layout. Management Sci.22 (2, October) 172181] in their study of computer algorithms versus humans in designing plant layouts. It attempts to show that Scriabin's and Vergin's experiments do not provide a useful comparison of computers and humans, and to point out several experimental procedures that would make comparisons of heuristic computer algorithms and humans more valid.
