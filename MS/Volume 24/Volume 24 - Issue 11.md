## 1. Planning the Process of Improving the Planning Process: A Case Study in Meta-Planning
### Author(s):
- James R. Emshoff
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
Most of the published literature on planning is either prescriptive (i.e., what ought to be the way planning is done), or descriptive (i.e., how it is actually carried out). This paper addresses the problem of moving from a relatively ineffective planning process to one that meets the prescriptive characteristics it theoretically ought to contain. The premise of the paper is that the conversion of a planning system needs as much planning as the process being planned. Hence, the short-hand title of meta-planning. The argument is made for more research on meta-planning, some initial hypotheses are developed toward a theory of meta-planning, and an extensive case study is presented to show, the credibility of the hypotheses.

## 2. Amtrak, Auto-Train, and Vacation Travel to Florida: Little Trains that Could
### Author(s):
- James H. Gapinski
- Howard P. Tuckman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
This paper examines whether Amtrak and Auto-Train altered the demand for vacation travel to Florida by train. A profile of tourist arrivals by train reveals a downward trend until inception of effective Amtrak and Auto-Train service; the trend then reverses. A travel demand function is postulated to include income, price, and interaction dummies which allow for consequences of the trains. Because of multicollinearity, the equation is estimated by ridge regression, the results suggesting that the trains modified both income and price effects in the function. Likely implications of Amtrak and Auto-Train for Florida's leisure industries are considered.

## 3. On the Hotel Overbooking ProblemAn Inventory System with Stochastic Cancellations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
M hotel rooms are available at a date n periods from now. Reservations are made by customers for that date, which is at the peak of the high season. Typically, for such a time period, a policy of overbooking is exercised by the hotel management. Customers, however, may cancel their previously confirmed reservations at any time prior to their arrival, with no penalty. On the other hand, new requests for rooms for that particular date are generated anew. At the end of each period the hotel management reviews both the inventory level of remaining uncanceled (previously confirmed) reservations and the total number of not-yet-confirmed new requests. At that time a decision is made regarding the inventory level of confirmed reservations with which to start the next period. A decision is one of three actions: (i) to keep the inventory at its present level (i.e., declining all new requests); (ii) to increase the level of overbooking by confirming some of the new requests and, if necessary, by trying to obtain some additional reservations (at some extra cost); (iii) to decrease the level of inventory by canceling some of the previously confirmed reservations (incurring a penalty for each such cancellation). Each occupied room at the target day carries a given profit, while each unhonored reservation at that time incurs a penalty. The problem is to find the optimal over-booking strategy that will maximize net profit.

## 4. Modified Policy Iteration Algorithms for Discounted Markov Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- Martin L. Puterman
- Moon Chirl Shin
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper we study a class of modified policy iteration algorithms for solving Markov decision problems. These correspond to performing policy evaluation by successive approximations. We discuss the relationship of these algorithms to Newton-Kantorovich iteration and demonstrate their covergence. We show that all of these algorithms converge at least as quickly as successive approximations and obtain estimates of their rates of convergence. An analysis of the computational requirements of these algorithms suggests that they may be appropriate for solving problems with either large numbers of actions, large numbers of states, sparse transition matrices, or small discount rates. These algorithms are compared to policy iteration, successive approximations, and Gauss-Seidel methods on large randomly generated test problems.

## 5. A Minimax Ordering Policy for the Infinite Stage Dynamic Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
This paper obtains closed form expressions for minimax ordering decisions in a dynamic inventory problem in which demands in successive periods are independent random variables that have known (finite) mean and variance, but whose distributions are otherwise arbitrary and may change from period to period. We assume zero setup cost, linear holding and backlogging costs, and immediate delivery of orders. The situation of a decision maker facing this unknown sequence of demand distributions can be viewed as a sequential zero-sum game against nature. A minimax ordering policy is one that minimizes the maximum expected discounted cost over the planning horizon, where the maximum is taken over all the probability distributions in the class described. A limiting base stock policy characterizes a minimax ordering policy for the infinite-stage model. We show that the limiting base stock policy is an optimal stationary policy for a finite horizon model if the terminal value function  cx is used. We also obtain conditions under which a myopic minimax ordering policy exists for an inventory model when the class of demand distributions is allowed to be nonstationary.

## 6. LIFO Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Morris A. Cohen

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
In many perishable product inventory systems where the issuing of stock to meet demand is controlled by the consumer, the movement of units through the system obeys a LIFO discipline.

## 7. An Efficient Integer Programming Algorithm with Network Cuts for Solving Resource-Constrained Scheduling Problems
### Author(s):
- F. Brian Talbot
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper we describe an integer programming algorithm for allocating limited resources to competing activities (jobs, tasks, etc.) of a project such that the completion time of the project is minimal among all possible completion times. Typical of such problems is the minimization of the completion time of projects of the PERT/CPM variety where limits on resource availability force the postponement of selected activities during project performance. Also included in this class of problems for which our procedure is applicable is the assignment of jobs to machines such that the elapsed time for completing all jobs (makespan) is a minimum over all possible job-machine assignments.

## 8. State of the ArtNetworks of Queues: A Survey of Weak Convergence Results
### Author(s):
- Austin J. Lemoine
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
This report is a sequel to our review paper, Lemoine [Lemoine, A. J. 1977. Networks of queuesA survey of equilibrium analysis. Management sci.24 464481.], on the equilibrium analysis of networks of queues. In this paper we review some weak convergence results for networks of queues, which include heavy traffic limit theorems for open networks and asymptotic results for large closed Markovian systems which are generalizations of the classical repairman problem. These weak convergence results justify certain approximation schemes for processes of interest. We also discuss some important open problems in the area of weak convergence results for networks of queues.

## 9. NoteOn Production Runs for Multiple Products: The Two-Product Heuristic
### Author(s):
- Stephen C. Graves
- Robert W. Haessler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1978
### Abstract:
The recent paper [Saipe, A. L. 1977. Production runs for multiple products: the two-product heuristic. Management Sci.23 (12, August) 13211327.] by Saipe considers the single-machine multi-product lot scheduling problem, this problem is concened with the determination of run sizes for a set of products which are produced on the same machine. In the paper [Saipe, A. L. 1977. Production runs for multiple products: the two-product heuristic. Management Sci.23 (12, August) 13211327.], a heuristic solution procedure, based on a solution procedure for the two-product lot scheduling problem, is proposed for the multi-product problem. The intent of this note is to raise three issues concerning the proposed heuristic procedure: (a) the optimality of the procedure for the two-product problem, (b) the performance of the procedure at full capacity for more than two products, and (c) the effectiveness of the procedure relative to alternative solution procedures.

## 10. Communication: Box-Jenkins Rules, O.K.Provided You Know It Makes Sense
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
I have read the interesting contribution, A Time Series Approach to Queueing Systems with Applications for Modeling Job-shop In-process Inventories, by Harold J. Steudel and S. M. Wu, Management Sci., March 1977. But, as a defender of the faith, I feel it is incumbent on me to draw attention to the trace of Black-Box heresy, implicit in their analysis.

### Abstract:
In his comments on our paper, A Time Series Approach to Queueing Systems with Applications for Modeling Job-Shop In-process Inventories, Management Sci., March 1977, Oliver D. Anderson points out an inadequacy in the modeling results we presented on pp. 748748. As a defender of the faith, he suggests that the culprit is our modeling strategy, a procedure he views as a Black-Box heresy. Since our modeling strategy is quite new and relatively unknown, especially compared to the Box-Jenkins (1) approach, Anderson's concluding remarks are not surprising.
