## 1. Consumer Preference Axioms: Behavioral Postulates for Describing and Predicting Stochastic Choice
### Author(s):
- John R. Hauser
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
This paper draws on econometrics, von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory, stochastic choice theory, and consumer behavior to develop five basic axioms or postulates of stochastic choice behavior. These axioms imply the existence and uniqueness of a preference function which identifies how consumers evaluate products in terms of product attributes. The preference function produces a scalar goodness measure for each product in a consumer's choice set. These goodness measures then predict choice probabilities for each product in a consumer's choice set. The advantage of these axioms is that they extend the strengths of von Neumann-Morgenstern theory to stochastic choice and make possible the determination of consistent choice probabilities.

## 2. The Application of a Product Mix Linear Programming Model in Corporate Policy Making
### Author(s):
- Jack Byrd, Jr.
- L. Ted Moore
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
This paper reports a real-life application of linear programming to corporate policy making. The model used in the study was designed to analyze the company's marketing and production policies. The model structure is unique, incorporating features of product mix, sequencing and blending models. The model's structure is described as well as typical results it produced. The recommendations for corporate actions arising from the model are also explained. Recommendations were made to alter the existing corporate policies on brand proliferation and limited inventory levels. The product line has been reduced as a result of the study, and a policy decision to expand the inventory has been made. The process of implementation is sketched to provide a feeling for the difficulties involved in corporate policy making.

## 3. Standard Setting in an Agency
### Author(s):
- Anthony A. Atkinson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
The decision to hire an agent (manager) to transact business on the principal's (owner's) behalf reflects (and results) in the agent's use of specialized skills and information in managing the agency's (firm's) activities. This paper considers an agency relationship where the principal and the agent have differing beliefs regarding the uncertain economic returns to the agency and investigates the properties of standard setting and profit sharing as an incentive device. It is demonstrated that this incentive scheme causes the agent to use, without intervention by the principal, his presumably superior information in a manner which is mutually beneficial to the agent and the principal. It is also demonstrated that this incentive scheme is not inferior and is usually superior to a scheme in which the principal instructs the agent on which decision to implement.

## 4. Optimal Dispatching of a Finite Capacity Shuttle
### Author(s):
- Rajat K. Deb
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of determining the optimal operating policy of a two terminal shuttle with fixed capacity Q  . The passengers arrive at each terminal according to Poisson processes and are transported by a single carrier operating between the terminals. The interterminal travel time is a positive random variable with finite expectation. Under a fairly general cost structure, we show that the policy which minimizes the expected total discounted cost over infinite time horizon has the following form: Suppose the carrier is at one of the terminals with x passengers waiting there and y passengers waiting at the other terminal. Then the optimal policy is to dispatch the carrier if and only if x  G(y), where G(y) is a monotone decreasing control function. Furthermore, G(y) is always less than or equal to the carrier capacity Q. This control function can be approximated by the linear function G(y) = K  y.

## 5. A By-Product Production System with an Alternative
### Author(s):
- Bryan L. Deuermeyer
- William P. Pierskalla
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
This paper considers the optimal control of a production system which is composed of two distinct production processes, types A and B, that produce two different products, 1 and 2, having distinct random demands. Production type A produces both products in amounts determined by a fixed set of production coefficients. Type B can only be used to make product 2. Costs consist of linear production costs and convex holding and shortage costs. Each period, the optimal production level of each type must be determined. The criterion is the minimum expected discounted total cost. Results show that the decision space of each period is partitioned into four regions by three monotone functions and a point. Extensions include capacitated production, nonstationary costs, lost sales, fixed lead times aid the general m process-n product system.

## 6. Order-Level Inventory Systems with Independent Stochastic Leadtimes
### Author(s):
- David Zalkind
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
Inventory systems where leadtimes are stochastic and independent, so that orders are not restricted to arrive in the same sequence in which they were placed, can arise if the vendor with whom orders are placed is unreliable in processing them or if orders for the same item are placed with different vendors at different times. We present a procedure for finding the optimal order-level Z (stock on hand plus on order) for a pre-determined scheduling-period t (time interval between decisions about placing orders), that is, a tZ policy. Backordering of shortages is assumed.

## 7. A Framework for the Study of Work Settings
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
This paper describes the development of an operations management model and its implementation in a simulation mode in order to study the effects of alternative organizational designs and person/work assignment criteria on the utilization of the technological and human resources of a firm. The model treats personnel, technology, and organizational structure as simultaneous decision variables. This is in contrast to much of the current research and practice in organization design where one or two of these inputs are assumed fixed and the focus is on modifying the remaining inputs. The model explores the impact of the congruence or consistency among the three above variables on work system outcomes, thereby utilizing a contingency approach to the design and analysis of work settings. The model was implemented in a computer simulation mode in the context of a hypothetical firm to examine its utility as a resource planning tool. The results support the reasonableness of the framework and also provide insights into the behavior of productive systems that were not originally anticipated. In order to operationalize the model, it was necessary to define explicitly many relationships among the constructs that have been explored only tentatively before, if at all. By attempting to synthesize current organizational behavior and behavioral science literature into causal chains, necessary areas for future research became manifest that might not have been recognized otherwise. The paper concludes with a discussion of the value, limitations, and relevance of this approach to the study and design of work systems.

## 8. Market Share Models as Approximators of Aggregated Heterogeneous Brand Choice Behavior
### Author(s):
- Moshe Givon
- Dan Horsky
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
The commonly used market share models are all based on the implicit assumption of a homogeneous population. However, studies of individual brand choice behavior tend to reject this basic premise. In this paper we attempt to explain why market share models perform well in spite of this underlying misspecification. A model which describes the individual's brand choice behavior is presented. This model allows an individual to follow either the Bernoulli, Markov or Linear Learning process as well as have different parameters from other people following the same process. A market share model which takes full account of this heterogeneity is derived and is compared to the traditional market share model in which homogeneous of consumers is assumed. The error in prediction which would result from the use of the homogeneous model is specified and its properties are examined. Conditions for the use, of the gravitational-type market share model, and, the first order lagged market share model are provided. It is shown that the homogeneous market share model will do well in time-series estimation but that the results will not always be appropriate for use in managerial decisions regarding forecasting and optimization.

## 10. Organizational Systematics: Taxonomic Lessons from Biology
### Author(s):
- Bill McKelvey
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
This paper argues that important lessons about the theory and method of organizational classification may be learned from biological systematics, defined as the science of differences. Three main components of systematics studies are discussed: (1) taxonomy, the development of a concept of organizational differences; (2) evolution, the tracing of the lineages of organizational form; and (3) classification, the development of procedures for identifying and placing organizational forms into classes. Furthermore, two kinds of classification are identified and several theories of classification are discussed. Systematics is seen as a necessary prerequisite to studies aiming to identify generalizable principles of organizational function and process. Finally, some implications for defining populations and drawing samples of organizations are noted, along with other implications for organization design and development and managerial practice.

## 11. A Direct Numerical Method for a Class of Queueing Problems
### Author(s):
- J. Wijngaard
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1978
### Abstract:
In this paper an efficient numerical method is given for determining stationary probabilities and average cost in queueing systems where the customers arrive singly and the service mechanism is negative exponential. State dependent service and arrival rates and batch service are allowed. The method is based on the property that the matrix of the embedded Markov process which describes the number of customers at the moments of arrival is almost triangular.
