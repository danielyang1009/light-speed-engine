### Abstract:
The attainment and enforcement of air quality standards is a complicated process. A crucial element in this process is the measurement of ambient air quality. The selection of locations for a limited number of monitors and their sampling frequencies is an important problem in the design of a regional air quality measurement system. This paper presents a mathematical model and procedure for solving the problem and demonstrates the conflicting nature of the principal guidelines specified by EPA. The method uses atmospheric simulation to assess the likelihood of standards violations, and linear programming to select the monitor locations and sampling frequencies. Since atmospheric simulation is required by EPA, the method appears to be accessible to virtually all local agencies. The use of linear programming permits extensive sensitivity analysis, which is illustrated in a case study. In particular, the trade-offs between conflicting EPA guidelines can be explicitly analyzed. The computational burden is primarily in the atmospheric simulation and is roughly proportional to the area of the region being studied. The added computational burden represented by the model solution is quite small.

## 2. An Analytical Investigation of Kotler's Competitive Simulation Model
### Author(s):
- Hermann Simon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
Kotler's well-known dynamic competitive simulation model is investigated by means of analytical methods. Unlike the simulation studies run by Kotler the analytical investigation reveals (1) that the model produces changes in price elasticity over time, which do not appear economically plausible, and (2) that the representation of competitive relations is highly questionable. It is shown that these properties of the model lead to consequences for the optimal pricing and promotion strategy which can hardly be considered as reasonable: Both the optimal prices and the optimal promotion efforts increase continuously over time andwithin a certain period of timethe optimal prices under competitive conditions are greater than the respective prices under monopolistic conditions.

## 3. The Nonstationary Infinite Horizon Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- Thomas E. Morton
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
By allowing disposal in each period, a sequence of upper and lower bounds on the infinite horizon nonstationary periodic review inventory problem is obtained. The nth bounds depend only on knowledge of the demand distributions in the first n periods, giving planning horizon results. In general, calculation of any bound requires solution of an ordinary n period problem, although for the proportional cost case the solution for n = 1 and good approximations for n = 2 may easily be given. The upper and lower relative cost and policy bounds are monotonic in the horizon length and, under mild conditions, converge to a unique infinite horizon solution. An analytic expression is given for the asymptotic convergence rate, which is geometric even for the undiscounted case. The formulation given here is a concrete example of the general planning horizon formulation for infinite horizon dynamic programming models set forth in [Morton, T. 1975. Infinite horizon dynamic programming modelsa planning horizon formulation. Carnegie-Mellon University Management Sciences Research Report No. 372, August (to appear in Operations Res.)].

## 4. An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Dialectical Inquiry Systems
### Author(s):
- Richard A. Cosier

- John C. Aplin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
Numerous quantitative planning models have been developed and successfully applied to facilitate the solutions of relatively well-structured problems. Unfortunately, qualitative models and techniques, particularly those applicable to ill-structured problems, are less well developed. One technique advocated by some researchers is the Dialectical Inquiry System (DIS), a planning process premised on Hegelian logic. Limited field studies have reported generally positive reactions toward DIS, but have not demonstrated that the DIS technique leads to improvement in objective performance or to more effective plans. This study reports the results of a controlled methodology that examines the effects of DIS on performance and participant attitudes. The results reveal that even though the conflict component of DIS was perceived as more useful in one instance, in general the DIS did not lead to significantly better objective performance when compared to alternative planning approaches. Given the risk and cost involved in organizational planning, further research should be conducted to evaluate the merit of the DIS.

## 5. Composition vs. Decomposition: Two Approaches to Modeling Organizational Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Dennis J. Sweeney

- Probir Roy
- Norman R. Baker
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
The most popular approach to developing mathematical models of organizational decision processes, the decomposition approach, begins with a mathematical statement of an ideal organizational problem and follows a process of decomposition to derive sub-problems solved by separate units at (possibly) different levels of the organization. Conversely, the composition approach starts with mathematical statements of the subproblems solved by the separate units and proceeds to develop a solution algorithm as a means of coordinating the activities of the separate units. A process of composition must then be followed if one is to discover the derived organizational problem actually solved. This paper offers an operational definition of an organizational decision process and relates this process to the anatomy of mathematical models purported as being representative of it. Implications regarding the potential of the decision process models as tools of organizational design are explored.

## 6. A Perspective on Modeling in Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- Steven N. Tani
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
We use mathematical modeling in decision analysis to help us obtain a profit lottery that is better than the one we can assess directly. The goodness of the profit lottery is defined by the concept of authenticity of probabilities. The role of modeling is to simplify our assessment task through decomposition of the profit lottery. However, budgetary constraints force us to make approximations in the modeling process and thereby force us to misstate the profit lottery. When dealing with our dissatisfactions about the modeling in a decision analysis, we regard models as subjective expressions of our uncertainty rather than as objective descriptions of the real-world.

## 7. A Trajectory Method for the Optimization of the Multi-Facility Location Problem With lp Distances
### Author(s):
- Z. Drezner
- G. O. Wesolowsky
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
We consider the multi-facility location problem of placing m new facilities optimally among n demand points (or existing facilities) so that the sum of all weighted lp distance pairs (facility to facility and facility to demand point) is minimized. A method involving the solution of differential equations by numerical integration is presented. This method is computationally comparable to many existing heuristic and iterative methods. It avoids the frequent convergence difficulties associated with many iterative methods for p > 1 and has no difficulties in dealing with Targe clusters of facilities of p = 1.

## 8. Integer Programming Solution of a Classification Problem
### Author(s):
- J. M. Liittschwager
- C. Wang
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
A classification problem is presented in which it is desired to assign a new individual or observation with k characteristics to one of two distinct populations based upon historical sets of samples from the two populations. The resulting classification problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. The solution, which can be obtained through use of a partitioning algorithm based on Benders decomposition, provides a nonparametric classification statistic which minimizes the expected total cost of misclassification. Also, an enumeration algorithm is developed for the special case of k = 2. Monte Carlo studies are reported which compare the results of the enumeration algorithm with Anderson's normal procedure for different underlying distributions. The performance of the enumeration algorithm is shown to be significantly better than Anderson's normal procedure for distributions with uncorrelated normal populations with unequal covariance matrices and for uncorrelated skewed populations with equal covariances.

## 9. Optimal Resource Allocation in Community Hypertension Programs
### Author(s):
- Albert L. Nichols
- Milton C. Weinstein
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
This paper presents a simple model to guide the efficient allocation of resources in community programs to detect and treat hypertension. We model such programs as n-component series systems, where each stage must function in sequence in order for the system as a whole to operate. The model differs from standard series reliability models in that, if a component fails, costs at subsequent stages are not incurred. This pay-as-you-go aspect implies that widespread screening is inefficient, and that resources could be better spent ensuring continued treatment of identified hypertensives. Calculations based on actual programs suggest that an optimal allocation of a fixed budget could increase significantly the number of hypertensives controlled, by about 40 percent in our example. This conclusion is robust under all but the most pessimistic assumptions.

## 10. NoteSufficient Conditions for Maintaining a Balanced University Budget
### Author(s):
- Arie P. Schinnar
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
In a recent article, in Management Science, W. F. Massy [Massy, W. F. 1976. A dynamic equilibrium model for university budget planning. Management Sci.23 (3, November) 248256.] outlines an interesting difference equation model of the Stanford University budget system. He proceeds then to solve for first and second order (i.e., short-term) balanced budget conditions. However, Massy's assertion that the balanced budget requirement cannot be modeled effectively for an extended time horizon is inaccurate. This note shows that such long-range solutions are readily available from the eigenstructure of his model. We derive simple sufficient conditions for maintaining balanced university budgets. Related issues of balanced budget attainability, empirical correspondence, and policy feasibility are also discussed.

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1978
### Abstract:
Lowe and Hurter introduced the generalized market area problem of simultaneously determining production levels and distribution patterns at n plants to satisfy demand distributed over a subset of Rk. Here we give simpler proofs and extensions of their results. We also show how the problem can be solved using unconstrained optimization techniques.
