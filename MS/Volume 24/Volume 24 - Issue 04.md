### Abstract:
Universities are complex institutions with multidimensional objectives. Lack of understanding of the production process for teaching and research, and a lack of approved procedures for making cost allocations, make it difficult to organize formal planning systems at the level of an academic department. At the same time, planning at the top administration level has been hampered by a lack of understanding of how primary planning variables are interrelated both through financial constraints and (usually unspecified) criteria for choice. This paper reports on a field test of various approaches for obtaining and quantifying subjective estimates of preference for academic outcomes in terms of a small set of university planning variables. The resulting preference functions were combined in a mathematical programming model with constraints on budget balance and growth to yield optimal university configurations.

## 2. Facility Location with Price-Sensitive Demands: Private, Public, and Quasi-Public
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
We formulate a general model for an uncapacitated facility location problem in which demands are related to the prices established at the various locations. Pricing decisions and location decisions are determined simultaneously in this model, in contrast to traditional location models that assume fixed demands and prices. We show that a transformation of the general model is equivalent to the fixed-demand location model of Efroymson and Ray, and thus may be solved by any of the exact or heuristic methods available for that model.

## 3. Statistical Model Comparison in Marketing Research
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
Analysis for marketing decisions often involves the consideration of several alternative statistical models. As an intermediate step prior to making policy decisions, a single model is typically selected and used to guide subsequent decisions. In this paper, Bayesian model comparison methods are shown to lead to a predictive distribution for the decision problem without the intermediate step of model selection. This approach utilizes all available information bearing on the validity of the alternative models, as well as information concerning model parameters, in order to draw inferences regarding the criterion of interest relative to the decision to be made. The procedure is illustrated in the context of an advertising budget decision in which the functional form of sales response to advertising is unknown.

## 4. Solving the Project Time/Cost Tradeoff Problem Using the Minimal Cut Concept
### Author(s):
- Steve Phillips, Jr.
- Mohamed I. Dessouky
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
This paper introduces a solution procedure for solving the project time/cost tradeoff problem of reducing a project duration at a minimum cost. The solution to the time/cost problem is achieved by locating a minimal cut in a flow network derived from the original project network. This minimal cut is then utilized to identify the project activities which should experience a duration modification in order to achieve the total project reduction. The paper will document this cut-based procedure and provide a practical application to a project situation.

## 5. Multiteam, Multiproject Research and Development Planning with GERT
### Author(s):
- Laurence J. Moore
- Bernard W. Taylor, III
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
This paper reports on a simulation study of multiple research and development projects that are worked on concurrently and sequentially by more than one research team. The technique employed in the modeling and simulation effort was GERT, which was used because of its capability to incorporate the probabilistic outcomes and feedback loops common to R&D projects. The GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique) includes the modeling of systems in network form and analysis through simulation. It is an important example of technological spin-off from space science research. GERT provides the capability to model and analyze networks of a very general form. Some of the features included in GERT networking are probabilistic branching (stochastic models), network looping (feedback loops), multiple sink nodes (multiple outcomes), multiple node realizations (repeat events), and multiple probability distributions (assigned to activity times). GERT networks are typically analyzed using the GERTS IIIZ simulation package, which provides statistics on project times and cost.

## 6. A Quantitative Model to Plan Regional Health Facility Systems
### Author(s):
- Vedia F. Dkmeci
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
This paper presents a quantitative planning model to determine the optimal characteristics (number, size and locations) of a regional health facility system. The system consists of a medical center, intermediate and local hospitals, and health centers. The quantitative model is based on the minimization of the total cost (sum of the transportation and facility costs) to the society. The optimal characteristics of the system are obtained using a heuristic method which includes both interactions of sublevel hospitals and environmental conditions as well. A numerical example is given to illustrate the computational procedure.

## 7. Joint Economically Optimal Design of X and R Control Charts
### Author(s):
- Erwin M. Saniga
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop an expected cost model for a process whose mean is controlled by an X chart and whose variance is controlled by an R chart. The expected cost comprises the fixed and variable costs of sampling, the cost of investigating and correcting the process when at least one control chart indicates that the process parameters have shifted, and the cost of producing defective units. We use a search procedure to determine the sample size, interval between samples and control limits for both charts that minimize the expected cost. Optimal solutions to numerical examples are presented. A sensitivity analysis of the model is performed. In addition, we find the optimal interval between samples and the expected cost for several examples with large shifts in the mean and variance where Shewhart's heuristic design is used in place of the optimal design. Comparison of the expected cost of the optimal design to the expected cost of Shewhart's design shows an increase in expected cost of only 0.4 to 8.2 percent for the latter design. But other situations are discussed and examples presented which indicate that the optimal design is preferred.

## 8. A Bayesian Approach to a Generalized House Selling Problem
### Author(s):
- S. Christian Albright
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
The problem of choosing the one best or several best of a set of sequentially observed random variables has been treated by many authors. For example, the seller of a house has this problem when deciding which bids on the house to accept and which to reject. We assume that the bids are identically distributed random variables and at most n can be observed. Each bid is accepted or rejected when received; a bid rejected now cannot be accepted later on. The object is to maximize the expected value of the bid actually accepted. Unlike most previous authors, we examine the case where one or more parameters of the common underlying distribution are unknown and information on these is updated in a Bayesian manner as the successive random variables are observed. Using the properties of location and scale parameters, an explicit form for the optimal policy is found when the underlying distribution is normal, uniform, or gamma and the prior is from the natural conjugate family. Simulation results concerning sensitivity of the value obtained to the amount and correctness of the prior information for these three families is then presented.

## 9. Job-Shop Scheduling by Implicit Enumeration
### Author(s):
- B. J. Lageweg
- J. K. Lenstra
- A. H. G. Rinnooy Kan
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
The classical combinatorial optimization problem of minimizing maximum completion time in a general job-shop has been the subject of extensive research. In this paper we review and extend this work. A general bounding approach is developed which includes all previously presented lower bounds as special cases. The strongest bound obtainable in this way is combined with two enumeration schemes, the relative merits of which are discussed. The results of some computational experiments and a large bibliography are included as well.

## 10. Deterministic Multi-Item Inventory Systems with Limited Capacity
### Author(s):
- Klaus Zoller
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
Available storage space frequently limits the aggregate stock level carried in multi-item inventory systems. In the deterministic case, the economic impact of storage capacity constraints may be reduced, and the utilization of the available facilities increased, by replenishment policies which include delivery schedules designed to avoid unnecessary clustering of order arrivals in the course of time. Under the assumption of a pure cycle reordering mode, simple expressions are derived for minimum storage space requirements and the associated optimal delivery schedules.

## 11. A Multiple Time Series Approach to Modeling the Manufacturing Job-Shop as a Network of Queues
### Author(s):
- Harold J. Steudel
- S. M. Pandit
- S. M. Wu
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
The behavior of a uniformly sampled network of job-shop queues is characterized and interpreted using multiple time series. An analysis of actual queue data for a network of five functionally related machine centers shows that queue behavior is adequately described as a first order vector valued autoregressive model. This model describes the stochastic nature of each queue in the shop and its relationship to the other queues comprising the network. A network of queues obtained from simulating this job-shop under a composite dispatching rule is also modeled and interpreted as a first order, multivariate autoregressive process.

## 12. State-of-the-ArtNetworks of QueuesA Survey of Equilibrium Analysis
### Author(s):
- Austin J. Lemoine
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1977
### Abstract:
Queueing network models abound in applications, but despite their importance many of the results for these models, both classical and recent, are not well known. The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of available equilibrium results for general Jackson systems, that is, queueing network models of the sort introduced in the classical papers of Jackson [Jackson, J. R. 1957. Networks of waiting lines. Oper. Res.5 518521; Jackson, J. R. 1963. Jobshop-like queueing systems. Management Sci.10 131142.]. In addition, we discuss methodology which has been employed to obtain the equilibrium results and we call attention to some important open problems. Detailed discussions are limited to a small group of papers which seem important to us, and there is considerable emphasis on recent work appearing in the applied probability literature. The list of references does include, however, work not reviewed here, along with other survey and background material.
