## 2. Sequential Investment Decisions with Bayesian Learning
### Author(s):
- R. M. Cyert
- M. H. DeGroot
- C. A. Holt
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes investment decisions that can be made in a modular form. It is motivated by the empirical observation that managements are particularly worried about downside risk. With a sequential approach this risk is minimized. An investment in a module produces information as well as profits or losses. In our model a larger investment produces more information in addition to larger profits or losses. Costs for changing the level of the investment from period to period are introduced. The optimal sequential investment policy is studied for a two-period problem. Conditions are presented under which no investment, a partial investment, or a full investment in the first period is optimal.

## 3. Transfer of Emergency Service Deployment Models to Operating Agencies
### Author(s):
- Jan M. Chaiken
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
Six deployment models for emergency service agencies were developed, field-tested, and documented during a two-year period ending October 1975. During the following eighteen months, records were kept of the extent to which the models were acquired by operating agencies and actually used for making deployment changes. The number of acquisitions ranged from zero for one model to 39 for another. Over half of those who acquire these models actually use them, and, except for one model, nearly all users made operational changes based on the output. Differences among the models illuminate the implementation process.

## 4. The Use of Exponentially-Smoothed Transition Matrices to Improve Forecasting of Cash Flows from Accounts Receivable
### Author(s):
- A. Wayne Corcoran
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
A pioneering application of a Markov chain to forecast account receivable flows (Cyert, Davidson, and Thompson [Cyert, R. M., H. J. Davidson, G. L. Thompson. 1962. Estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts by Markov chains. Management Sci. (August) 287303.]) employed an unusual (the oldest balance) method of aging accounts and an assumption that the resulting transition matrix was stable. Forecasting steady state results was the primary focus of the application.

## 5. Resource Management in the Petrochemical Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
The petrochemical industry is a system of chemical processes that convert petroleum and natural gas into chemicals from which plastics, elastomers, and other synthetic materials can be made. As petroleum and natural gas supplies dwindle, this industry must look elsewhere for its raw materials. A linear-programming model of the industry is described, in which the objective is the efficient use of feedstocks. Four feedstock alternatives are evaluated with this model; the results of these studies are analyzed with respect to changes in the optimal process technology resulting from changes in feedstock availability. The model solutions also indicate the net change in feedstock requirement for the industry, per unit increase in demand for each product. This feedstock efficiency index indicates areas of incentive for developing new process technology; these areas are different for different feedstock alternatives. Analysis such as this should provide government planners with information for long-range planning and resource management.

## 6. Solving the Pipe Network Analysis Problem Using Optimization Techniques

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
For more than forty years, approximate solutions for the classical pipe network analysis problem have been obtained by direct solution of the nonlinear stationary point conditions. We propose a revolutionary new approach involving optimization techniques for solving this well-known engineering problem. It is shown that the pipe network analysis problem may be described mathematically in terms of a nonlinear convex cost network flow problem. Three mathematical programming algorithms for solving this problem have been coded and are computationally compared with a code using the traditional Newton-Raphson technique. The computational experience demonstrates that this new approach provides an attractive alternative for solving this important problem.

## 7. An Empirical Evaluation of a Composite Heterogeneous Model of Brand Choice and Purchase Timing Behavior
### Author(s):
- Fred S. Zufryden
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
In a previous article, a new model of brand choice and purchase timing behavior has been discussed with respect to its theoretical foundations and mathematical development (Zufryden, F. S. 1977. A composite heterogeneous model of brand choice and purchase timing behavior, theoretical development. Management Sci.24 (2, October).). This article first develops a new statistical methodology to estimate the model's parameters. Then, the model is empirically evaluated and compared to several previous stochastic models in an actual market situation. The empirical evidence provides strong support of the viability of the proposed model given its ability to describe and predict measures of market behavior and product performance that are of importance to marketing managers. Such measures of market behavior as the cumulative penetration, trial and repeat purchase patterns of a chosen brand all appear to coincide closely with actual data.

## 8. Designing Scientific Journals: Issues and Survey Results
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1978
### Abstract:
The design parameters of scientific journals are important policy choices for journal editors as well as for the professional areas which they represent. The editorial structure of a journal presents a set of choices which importantly affect the variety of papers which are published, those that are submitted, and to some degree, the nature of future research in an area. These elements, in turn, affect reader satisfaction, journal subscriptions, and the future viability of sponsoring professional societies. This paper presents a conceptual structure for the journal-design problem and a set of survey results which should aid in addressing journal design issues and policy questions. The purpose of the paper is to define the issues and to present data in a manner that will stimulate discussion and further analyses.
