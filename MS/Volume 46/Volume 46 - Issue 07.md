### Abstract:
Tackling the steep increase in drug costs is an especially important issue among many health care providers and insurers. To entice the clinics to become more cost efficient, the U.S. federal government, as well as many HMOs, have developed various cost containment initiatives recently. However, the impact of these initiatives on the patients' well-being, the clinic's profitability, and the pharmaceutical firm's profitability has not been formally analyzed. In this paper we develop a mathematical model that is intended to examine the impact of a reimbursement policy for drug usage. Despite the simplistic structure of our model, the analysis enhances our understanding of the joint impact of the reimbursement policy on the patients, the clinic, and the pharmaceutical firm. Thus, our analysis can provide valuable information for evaluating the effectiveness of implementing such a reimbursement policy. In addition, we utilize the data gathered from a clinic to help support the assumptions and results of the underlying model.

## 2. Short-Term Variations and Long-Term Dynamics in Commodity Prices
### Author(s):
- Eduardo Schwartz
- James E. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
In this article, we develop a two-factor model of commodity prices that allows meanreversion in short-term prices and uncertainty in the equilibrium level to which prices revert. Although these two factors are not directly observable, they may be estimated from spot and futures prices. Intuitively, movements in prices for long-maturity futures contracts provide information about the equilibrium price level, and differences between the prices for the short- and long-term contracts provide information about short-term variations in prices. We show that, although this model does not explicitly consider changes in convenience yields over time, this short-term/long-term model is equivalent to the stochastic convenience yield model developed in Gibson and Schwartz (1990). We estimate the parameters of the model using prices for oil futures contracts and apply the model to some hypothetical oil-linked assets to demonstrate its use and some of its advantages over the Gibson-Schwartz model.

## 3. The Inverse Newsvendor Problem: Choosing an Optimal Demand Portfolio for Capacitated Resources
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
The classical newsvendor problem is one of optimally choosing a level of capacity to respond to a known demand distribution. The inverse newsvendor problem is one of optimally choosing a demand distribution with fixed capacity. The applications of the inverse problem include industrial settings where demand management is relatively less costly than capacity adjustments. Demand distributions are chosen from an opportunity set, which reflects the set of market opportunities for the firm. We analyze the firm's profit as a function of these demand alternatives, provide solution methods and insights, and identify inefficient and dominated distributions. We provide results when the opportunity set is known or only partially known. We extend the results to cases in which there are multiple prioritized customer classes that share the firm's productive capacity. This paper was motivated by an industrial application in a firm selling a semicommodity product into three prioritized industrial sectors. We review the application of our methods to this setting.

## 4. Sequential Product Positioning Under Differential Costs
### Author(s):
- Rajeev K. Tyagi
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
This paper examines the product positioning decisions of firms that enter a market sequentially and that have potentially different cost structures. It shows that if the first mover knows the second mover to have a lower production cost, it positions away from the most attractive location in the market; further, the larger the second-mover's cost advantage, the farther away the first mover positions from the most attractive location. The paper also models uncertainty in the first-mover's mind about the later-entrant's cost structure, and shows that an increase in this uncertainty (in the sense of mean-preserving spread) also makes the first mover position farther from the most attractive location in the market. Overall, this paper suggests that unless the first entrant in a market is certain that the later entrant will not have a superior cost structure, it may be better off leaving the best position in the market vacant and having a niche or fringe product.

## 5. Perishable Asset Revenue Management with Markovian Time Dependent Demand Intensities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
Many industries face the problem of selling a fixed stock of items over a finite horizon. These industries include airlines selling seats before planes depart, hotels renting rooms before midnight, theaters selling seats before curtain time, and retailers selling seasonal items with long procurement lead times. Given a sunk investment in seats, rooms, or winter coats, the objective for these industries is to maximize revenues in excess of salvage value. When demand is price sensitive and stochastic, pricing is an effective tool to maximize expected revenues. In this paper we address the problem of deciding the optimal timing of price changes within a given menu of allowable, possibly time dependent, price paths each of which is associated with a general Poisson process with Markovian, time dependent, predictable intensities. We show that a set of variational inequalities characterize the value functions and the optimal (possibly random) time changes. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal value functions and the optimal pricing policy.

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
This paper provides a new portfolio selection rule. The objective is to minimize the maximum individual risk and we use an l∞ function as the risk measure. We provide an explicit analytical solution for the model and are thus able to plot the entire efficient frontier. Our selection rule is very conservative. One of the features of the solution is that it does not explicitly involve the covariance of the asset returns.

## 7. Exact and Heuristic Solutions for a Shipment Problem with Given Frequencies
### Author(s):
- Luca Bertazzi

- Walter Ukovich
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of shipping several products from an origin to a destination when a discrete set of shipping frequencies is available, in such a way that the sum of the transportation and inventory costs is minimized. This problem, which is known to be NP-hard, has applications in transportation planning and in location analysis. In this paper we derive dominance rules for the problem solutions that allow a tightening of the bounds on the problem variables and improve the efficiency of a known branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, we present some heuristics and compare them with two different modifications of an EOQ-type algorithm for the solution of the problem with continuous frequencies.

## 8. Nonparametric Estimation of the Cumulative Intensity Function for a Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process from Overlapping Realizations
### Author(s):
- Bradford L. Arkin
- Lawrence M. Leemis
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
A nonparametric technique for estimating the cumulative intensity function of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process from one or more realizations on an interval is extended here to include realizations that overlap. This technique does not require any arbitrary parameters from the modeler, and the estimated cumulative intensity function can be used to generate a point process for simulation by inversion.

## 9. A New Algebraic Geometry Algorithm for Integer Programming
### Author(s):
- Dimitris Bertsimas
- Georgia Perakis

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
We propose a new algorithm for solving integer programming (IP) problems that is based on ideas from algebraic geometry. The method provides a natural generalization of the Farkas lemma for IP, leads to a way of performing sensitivity analysis, offers a systematic enumeration of all feasible solutions, and gives structural information of the feasible set of a given IP. We provide several examples that offer insights on the algorithm and its properties.

## 10. Bounds on the Opportunity Cost of Neglecting Reoptimization in Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- Osman Oğuz
### Published:
- 1 Jul 2000
### Abstract:
Postoptimality or sensitivity analysis are well-developed subjects in almost all branches of mathematical programming. In this note, we propose a simple formula which can be used to get preliminary bounds on the value of this type of analysis for a specific class of mathematical programming problems. We also show that our bounds are tight.
