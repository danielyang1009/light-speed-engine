### Abstract:
This exploratory research on a decade of Total Quality Management in one factory opens up the black box of the learning curve. Based on the organizational learning literature, we derive a quality learning curve that links different types of learning in quality improvement projects to the evolution of the factory's waste rate. Only 25% of the quality improvement projects—which acquired both know-why and know-how—accelerated waste reduction. The other 75% of the projects either impeded or did not affect waste reduction. In complex and dynamic production environments, locally acquired knowledge is difficult to disseminate. The combination of know-why and know-how facilitates its dissemination.

### Abstract:
This study investigates the effect of knowledge distribution and group structure on performance in MBA game teams. We found that group performance was contingent on the distribution of knowledge within the group and networks of social relationships among group members. Studying 39 teams of MBA students in two management simulation games, we found that, in general, groups that had broadly distributed knowledge, i.e., groups made up of members who had general knowledge, outperformed groups that had knowledge concentrated in different members, i.e., groups made up of members who had specialized or both specialized and general knowledge. However, the advantage that the former enjoyed over the latter disappeared when groups of specialists or mixed groups had decentralized network structures.

## 3. The Value of Information Sharing in a Two-Level Supply Chain
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Many companies have embarked on initiatives that enable more demand information sharing between retailers and their upstream suppliers. While the literature on such initiatives in the business press is proliferating, it is not clear how one can quantify the benefits of these initiatives and how one can identify the drivers of the magnitudes of these benefits. Using analytical models, this paper aims at addressing these questions for a simple two-level supply chain with nonstationary end demands. Our analysis suggests that the value of demand information sharing can be quite high, especially when demands are significantly correlated over time.

## 4. A Continuous-Time Yield Management Model with Multiple Prices and Reversible Price Changes
### Author(s):
- Youyi Feng
- Baichun Xiao
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
This article studies a continuous-time yield management model in which reversible price changes are allowed. We assume that perishable assets are offered at a set of discrete price levels. Demand at each level is a Poisson process. To maximize the expected revenue, management controls the price dynamically as sales evolve. We show that a subset of these prices that form a concave envelope is potentially optimal. We formulate the problem into an intensity control model and derive the optimal solution in closed form. Properties of the optimal solution and their policy implementations are discussed. Numerical examples are provided.

## 5. The Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio Under Stochastic Interest Rates
### Author(s):
- Abraham Lioui
- Patrice Poncet
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
In an environment where interest rates are stochastic, we examine the case of a “pure” hedger endowed with a fixed position in a long term bond. In contrast to conventional wisdom according to which the difference between hedging through forward contracts and futures is immaterial, it turns out that the minimum variance hedge ratio using forwards comprises two terms instead of one only when using futures. The magnitude of the difference between the two hedge ratios may be important under some plausible assumptions. This result is due to the presence of additional interest rate risk that bears on the profit-and-loss statement associated with the forward position. This sheds some additional light on the respective features of forward and futures contracts written on interest rate-sensitive securities.

## 6. Attribute Conflict and Preference Uncertainty: The RandMAU Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
This paper extends the behavioral results reported in Fischer et al. (2000) by developing a model addressing preference uncertainty in multiattribute evaluation. The model is motivated by two hypotheses regarding properties of multiattribute profiles that lead to greater preference uncertainty. Our attribute conflict hypothesis predicts that greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an alternative) leads to more preference uncertainty. Our attribute extremity hypothesis predicts that greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) leads to less preference uncertainty. To provide a deeper explanation of attribute conflict and extremity effects, we develop RandMAU, a family of additive (RandAUF) and multiplicative (RandMUF) random weights multiattribute utility models. In RandMAU models, preference uncertainty is represented as random variation in both the weighting parameters governing trade-offs among attributes and the curvature parameters governing single-attribute evaluations. Simulation results show that RandMUF successfully predicts both the attribute conflict and attribute extremity effects exhibited by the experimental participants in Fischer et al. (2000). It also predicts an outcome value effect on error whose form depends on the shape of single-attribute functions and on the type of multiattribute combination rule.

## 7. Technical Note: Longitudinal Performance Stratification—An Iterative Kolmogorov-Smirnov Approach
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
- Robert R. Wiggins
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
The stratification of entities into statistically distinct levels of performance over time is a problem encountered in a number of research and management settings. Traditional techniques to address this issue (e.g., cluster analysis) often require, either ex ante or ex post, the exogenous specification of the number of groups to be employed in further analysis—and are not especially suited to dealing with distributions over time. The methodology presented here iteratively applies the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test to identify the number and membership of statistically significantly different performance strata on a longitudinal basis. Monte Carlo simulations compare the new methodology with traditional clustering techniques. An application that stratifies mutual funds by returns illustrates the technique.

## 8. A Decomposition-Based Pricing Procedure for Large-Scale Linear Programs: An Application to the Linear Multicommodity Flow Problem
### Author(s):
- John W. Mamer
- Richard D. McBride
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
We propose and test a new pricing procedure for solving large-scale structured linear programs. The procedure interactively solves a relaxed subproblem to identify potential entering basic columns. The subproblem is chosen to exploit special structure, rendering it easy to solve. The effect of the procedure is the reduction of the number of pivots needed to solve the problem. Our approach is motivated by the column-generation approach of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. We test our procedure on two sets of multicommodity flow problems. One group of test problems arises in routing telecommunications traffic and the second group is a set of logistics problem which have been widely used to test multicommodity flow algorithms.

## 9. Scheduling Resource-Constrained Projects Competitively at Modest Memory Requirements
### Author(s):
- Arno Sprecher
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
We consider the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The purpose of this paper is to direct the focus to a branch-and-bound concept that can, by simple adaptations, operate on a wide range of problem settings. The general approach can, e.g., deal with multimode problems, resource availability varying with time, and a wide range of objectives. Even the simple assembly line balancing problem of type-1 can be competitively approached with some modifications. Although the algorithm is the most general and simple one currently available for resource-constrained project scheduling, the computational performance can compete with the best approaches available for the single-mode problem. The algorithm uses far less memory than the state-of-the-art procedure, i.e., 256 KB versus 24 MB, for solving the standard benchmark set with projects consisting of 32 activities within comparable time. If both approaches are allowed to make limited use of memory, i.e., 256 KB, then more than 97% of the benchmark instances can be solved within fractions of the time required by the current state-of-the-art procedure. The truncated version of our algorithm achieves at 256 KB approximately the results of the truncated version of the state-of-the-art approach at 24 MB. Since in general the memory requirements exponentially grow with the number of activities the project consists of, memory will become a critical resource, and the strategy to access previously stored information will gain fundamental importance when solving larger projects.

## 10. bc — prod: A Specialized Branch-and-Cut System for Lot-Sizing Problems
### Author(s):
- Gaetan Belvaux
- Laurence A. Wolsey
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
bc — prod is a prototype modelling and optimization system designed and able to tackle a wide variety of the discrete-time lot-sizing problems arising both in practice and in the literature. To use bc — prod, the user needs to formulate his/her problem as a mixed integer program using XPRESS-MP's mp — model, a standard mathematical programming modelling language, taking into account a reserved set of key words for specific lot-sizing objects, such as production variables, storage, and demand data, etc. The problem is then solved by the XPRESS-MP branch-and-bound system including lot-sizing specific preprocessing, cutting planes for different aspects of lot-sizing problems, plus general cutting planes, and a lot-sizing-specific primal heuristic. Results are presented for a wide variety of big bucket and small bucket models with set-up and start-up costs and times.

## 11. A Note on Assemble-to-Order Systems with Batch Ordering
### Author(s):
- Jing-Sheng Song
### Published:
- 1 May 2000
### Abstract:
We study an assemble-to-order inventory system. The stocks are held for components, with final products assembled only when customer orders are realized. Customer orders form a multivariate compound Poisson process, component replenishment leadtimes are constant, and demands in excess of inventory on hand are backlogged. The component inventories are controlled by (R, nQ) policies. We show that under certain general conditions the inventory position vector has a uniform equilibrium distribution. This result generalizes the corresponding single-item theory considerably. It allows us to express the key performance measures of the system, such as order fill rates and average order-based backorders, as the averages of their counterparts in the base-stock systems.
