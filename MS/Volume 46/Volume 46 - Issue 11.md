## 1. Drive out Fear (Unless You Can Drive It in): The Role of Agency and Job Security in Process Improvement
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Understanding the wide range of outcomes achieved by firms trying to implement Total Quality Management (TQM) and similar process improvement initiatives presents a challenge to management theory: A few firms reap sustained benefits from their programs, but most efforts fail and are abandoned. In this paper I study one dimension of this phenomenon: the role of impending layoffs in determining employee commitment to process improvement. Currently, the literature provides two opposing theories concerning the effect of job security on the ability of firms to implement change initiatives. The “Drive Out Fear” school argues that firms must commit to job security, while the “Drive In Fear” school emphasizes the positive role that insecurity plays in motivating change. In this study a contract theoretic model is developed to analyze the role of agency in process improvement. The main insight of the study is that there are two types of job security, internal and external, that have opposing impacts on the firm's ability to implement improvement initiatives. The distinction is useful in explaining the results of different case studies and can reconcile the two change theories.

## 2. Efficient Supply Contracts for Fashion Goods with Forecast Updating and Two Production Modes
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We examine the problem of developing supply contracts that encourage proper coordination of forecast information and production decisions between a manufacturer and distributor of high fashion, seasonal products operating in a two-mode production environment. The first production mode is relatively cheap but requires a long lead time while the second is expensive but offers quick turnaround. We focus on contracts of the form (w1, w2, b) where wi is the wholesale price offered for production mode i and b is a return price offered for items left over at the end of the season. We find that such a contract can coordinate the manufacturer and distributor to act in the best interest of the channel. The pricing conditions needed to ensure an efficient solution vary depending on the degree of demand forecast improvement between periods and the manufacturer's access to forecast information. We also examine whether these conditions ensure a Pareto optimal solution with respect to two traditional production settings.

### Abstract:
We address the procurement of new components for recyclable products in the context of Kodak's single-use camera. The objective is to find an ordering policy that minimizes the total expected procurement, inventory holding, and lost sales cost. Distinguishing characteristics of the system are the uncertainty and unobservability associated with return flows of used cameras. We model the system as a closed queueing network, develop a heuristic procedure for adaptive estimation and control, and illustrate our methods with disguised data from Kodak. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of various system characteristics such as informational structure, procurement delay, demand rate, and length of the product's life cycle.

## 4. Centralization vs. Decentralization in a Multi-Unit Organization: A Computational Model of a Retail Chain as a Multi-Agent Adaptive System
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2000
### Abstract:
A computational model of a retail chain is developed in which store managers continually search for better practices. Search takes place over a rugged landscape defined over the space of store practices. The main objective of this research is to determine how the amount of discretion given to store managers as to how they run their stores influences the rate of innovation at the store level. We find that greater decentralization enhances firm performance when stores' markets are sufficiently different, the horizon is sufficiently long, and markets are sufficiently stable.

## 5. A Two-Echelon Repairable Inventory System with Stocking-Center-Dependent Depot Replenishment Lead Times
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Consider a two-echelon repairable inventory system consisting of a central depot and multiple stocking centers. The centers provide parts replacement service to customers and replenish their inventory from the depot, following a one-for-one policy. The depot fills center replenishment orders on a first-come-first-serve basis. Defectives received at the centers are passed to the depot for repair and depot inventory replenishment. For this system, existing models (e.g., the METRIC model) usually assume that the depot replenishment lead times (DRLTs) are i.i.d., which however, does not fit well into the service parts logistics system that motivated this research. Because the DRLTs consist of the sum of repair times, defective return times, and transportation times, they are different across stocking centers, which are located globally.

## 6. The Gas Transmission Problem Solved by an Extension of the Simplex Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Daniel De Wolf
- Yves Smeers
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2000
### Abstract:
The problem of distributing gas through a network of pipelines is formulated as a cost minimization subject to nonlinear flow-pressure relations, material balances, and pressure bounds. The solution method is based on piecewise linear approximations of the nonlinear flow-pressure relations. The approximated problem is solved by an extension of the Simplex method. The solution method is tested on real-world data and compared with alternative solution methods.

## 7. Inducing Performance in a Queue via Prices: The Case of a Riverine Port
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2000
### Abstract:
To optimize large-scale queuing systems configurations, OR professionals typically use discrete event simulation packages to examine in detail the movement of entities through such systems, assuming stochastic but fixed arrival patterns. Demand aspects are, however, routinely ignored as few attempts are made to capture the feedback effect of queue performance on the arrival process. Econometricians, on the other hand, use a simultaneous equations estimation approach relying on past data, but they typically disregard the technological insights provided by simulation. This paper combines both tools to study the ailing port system of Calcutta, India, and concludes that raising prices will improve both economic and engineering performances. Microeconomic models of shipowner behavior are constructed to explain the nature of the empirical findings. Finally, full-equilibrium demand elasticities are calculated using the dual prices from an appropriate nonlinear program, which are then compared to the benchmark value expected of profit-maximizing behavior.

## 8. A Parameter-Free Elicitation of the Probability Weighting Function in Medical Decision Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2000
### Abstract:
An important reason why people violate expected utility theory is probability weighting. Previous studies on the probability weighting function typically assume a specific parametric form, exclude heterogeneity in individual preferences, and exclusively consider monetary decision making. This study presents a method to elicit the probability weighting function in rank-dependent expected utility theory that makes no prior assumptions about the functional form of the probability weighting function. We use both aggregate and individual subject data, thereby allowing for heterogeneity of individual preferences, and we examine probability weighting in a new domain, medical decision making. There is significant evidence of probability weighting both at the aggregate and at the individual subject level. The modal probability weighting function is inverse S-shaped, displaying both lower subadditivity and upper subadditivity. Probability weighting is in particular relevant at the boundaries of the unit interval. Compared to studies involving monetary outcomes, we generally find more elevation of the probability weighting function. The robustness of the empirical findings on probability weighting indicates its importance. Ignoring probability weighting in modeling decision under risk and in utility measurement is likely to lead to descriptively invalid theories and distorted elicitations.

## 9. Parameter-Free Elicitation of Utility and Probability Weighting Functions
### Author(s):
- Mohammed Abdellaoui
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2000
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a two-step method to successively elicit utility functions and decision weights under rank-dependent expected utility theory and its “more descriptive” version: cumulative prospect theory. The novelty of the method is that it is parameter-free, and thus elicits the whole individual preference functional without imposing any prior restriction. This method is used in an experimental study to elicit individual utility and probability weighting functions for monetary outcomes in the gain and loss domains. Concave utility functions are obtained for gains and convex utility functions for losses. The elicited weighting functions satisfy upper and lower subadditivity and are consistent with previous parametric estimations. The data also show that the probability weighting function for losses is more “elevated” than for gains.
