## 1. Cross-Functional Influence in New Product Development: An Exploratory Study of Marketing and R…D Perspectives

### Abstract:
Previous research in new product development (NPD) has focused on the participation of marketing and R…D personnel, but little attention has been paid to their influence. This study examined the effects of marketing's and R…D's influence and participation on new product performance and the differential effects of personal, new product, and organizational factors on their influence in the NPD process as seen from each other's perspective. The results suggest that marketing's and R…D's self-reported influence and their influence as reported by the other have a differential impact on new product performance. Unlike R…D's participation as perceived by marketing, marketing's participation as perceived by R…D affects new product performance only when its influence is high. The results also suggest that marketing's and R…D's influence in the NPD process is differentially affected by personal, new product, and organizational factors.

## 2. The Importance of Organizational Structure for the Adoption of Innovations

### Abstract:
Organizational structure affects both the overall behavior of firms and the situations of individuals and subunits within firms. The effect of exogenous changes in the environment (market prices, costs, or regulations) on organizations can be partitioned into the immediate direct effect of the change and the full effect after organizational structure has had time to adjust. This paper develops a computational model of the diffusion of a profitable innovation through a firm, and uses numerical simulations to calculate the relative importance of the direct and structural adjustment components of changes in profitability. One finding is that a failure to recognize the importance of organizational structure on the performance of firms will lead to serious bias in estimation of the costs or benefits of a change in external circumstances. The type of network model developed also has implications for the individuals and divisions that make up the firm. We examine some of the structural characteristics of well-adapted organizations, and show that asymmetries and economic inequalities emerge even when the individual agents' personal characteristics are identical.

## 3. Competing with New Product Technologies: A Process Model of Strategy

### Abstract:
This paper draws upon research in the economics of technical change and in the social construction of technology to develop and test a process model of strategy. We conducted a longitudinal study of leading firms that were sponsoring new and competing product technologies in two industries: the videoplayer industry and the medical diagnostic imaging industry. We built original datasets on the actions of these firms, and then empirically examined the strategy process. Our findings indicate that the nature of the product technology, whether novel or evolved, and the market, whether concentrated or dispersed, influences when firms use technical or institutional strategies to get their new product technology accepted by the market.

## 4. Managing the Delivery of Dialysis Therapy: A Multiclass Fluid Model Analysis
### Author(s):

- Prashant C. Fuloria
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2000
### Abstract:
Motivatedby the exceptionally high mortality statistics of dialysis patients and the ongoing debate about the adequacy of the current reimbursement for dialysis in the United States, we pursue a detailed analysis of the dialysis delivery system. The analysis is based on a multiclass fluid model for the dialysis facility, which combines a pharmacokinetics model of dialysis and an empirically validated model of dialysis-specific mortality. Assuming that the facility operates under budget and capacity constraints, our analysis determines the main factors that affect the delivery of dialysis. Numerical results, which are representative of the dialysis environment in the US, demonstrate the accuracy of the model and provide concrete insights about the operations of the dialysis facility. A major finding is that an improvement in the technology of dialysis is likely to have a more substantial impact on the overall life expectancy of the dialysis population as compared to an increase in the dialysis reimbursement rate.

## 5. Assessing the Construct Validity of Risk Attitude
### Author(s):
- Joost M.E. Pennings

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2000
### Abstract:
Two major approaches to measuring risk attitude are compared. One, based on the expected utility model is derived from responses to lotteries and direct scaling. The other measure is a psychometric approach based on Likert statements that produces a unidimensional risk attitude scale. The data are from computer-assisted interviews of 346 Dutch owner-managers of hog farms, who made decisions about their own businesses. While the measures demonstrate some degree of convergent validity, those measures based on lotteries were better predictors of actual market behavior. In contrast the psychometric scale showed more agreement to selfreported measures of innovativeness, market orientation, and the intention to reduce risk. In light of the higher predictive validity of lottery-based measurements, werecommend elicitation methods based on the expected utility paradigm.

## 6. Variance Reduction Techniques for Estimating Value-at-Risk
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2000
### Abstract:
This paper describes, analyzes and evaluates an algorithm for estimating portfolio loss probabilities using Monte Carlo simulation.Obtaining accurate estimates of such loss probabilities is essential to calculating value-at-risk, which is a quantile of the loss distribution. The method employs a quadratic (“delta-gamma”) approximation to the change in portfolio value to guide the selection of effective variance reduction techniques;specifically importance sampling and stratified sampling.If the approximation is exact, then the importance sampling is shown to be asymptotically optimal.Numerical results indicate that an appropriate combination of importance sampling and stratified sampling can result in large variance reductions when estimating the probability of large portfolio losses.

## 7. A Time-Oriented Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling with Generalised Precedence Constraints
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2000
### Abstract:
Resource-constrained project scheduling with generalised precedence constraints is a very general scheduling model with applications in areas such as make-to-order production planning. We describe a time-oriented branch-and-bound algorithm that uses constraint-propagation techniques which actively exploit the temporal and resource constraints of the problem in order to reduce the search space. Extensive computational experiments with systematically generated test problems show that the algorithm solves more problems to optimality than other exact solution procedures which have recently been proposed, and that the truncated version of the algorithm is also a very good heuristic.
