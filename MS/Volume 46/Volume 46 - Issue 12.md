## 1. Determinants of User Innovation and Innovation Sharing in a Local Market
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
It is known that end users of products and services sometimes innovate, and that innovations developed by users sometimes become the basis for important newcommercial products and services. It has also been argued and to some extent shown that such innovations will be found concentrated in a “lead user” segment of the user community. However, neither the characteristics of innovating users nor the scope of the community that they “lead” has been explored in depth.

## 2. Information and Incentive Effects of Inventory in JIT Production

### Abstract:
This paper provides an economic rationale for modern manufacturing control practices such as the minimal inventories in Just in Time (JIT)systems, zero-defect policies, and continuous improvement. The popular and academic literature contains descriptive studies on the mechanics of these systems and their perceived benefits. We use a model of production to analyze both informational and incentive rationales for reduced inventories. A JIT-like environment of low inventory levels is optimal in our model because it helps workers to better observe and understand the production process and to think and act creatively to improve operational reliability and yields. Empirical evidence using data obtained from 116 plants worldwide supports our conclusions about the effect of reduced inventories on process reliability, product quality, and cost.

## 3. Efficient Risk Sharing: The Last Frontier
### Author(s):
- John W. Pratt
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
When rational risk-averse agents must choose among and share monetary risks, it is known that efficient sharing is typically nonlinear, even with common beliefs. Wherever it is, the sharing rule may affect the choice, randomized choice may allow everyone to gain, and indeed a randomized choice between unacceptable risks may be acceptable. An important exception occurs if the agents' utility functions are all exponential, all logarithmic, or all the same power (HARA). Then choices should accord with a group utility function of the same form independent of the sharing rule, randomization never helps, and all efficient sharing rules are linear. This self-contained paper simplifies, refines, and completes earlier analyses, identifying all exceptions; they are the linear sharing rules that make the agents' utilities agree. Aside from HARA, this can only occur for precisely one linear sharing rule or, in periodic versions of HARA, countably many.

## 4. Coordinating Expertise in Software Development Teams
### Author(s):

- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
Like all teams, knowledge teams must acquire and manage critical resources in order to accomplish their work. The most critical resource for knowledge teams is expertise, or specialized skills and knowledge, but the mere presence of expertise on a team is insufficient to produce high-quality work. Expertise must be managed and coordinated in order to leverage its potential. That is, teams must be able to manage their skill and knowledge interdependencies effectively through expertise coordination, which entails knowing where expertise is located, knowing where expertise is needed, and bringing needed expertise to bear. This study investigates the importance of expertise coordination through a cross-sectional investigation of 69 software development teams. The analysis reveals that expertise coordination shows a strong relationship with team performance that remains significant over and above team input characteristics, presence of expertise, and administrative coordination.

## 5. Decision Support for a Housing Mobility Program Using a Multiobjective Optimization Model
### Author(s):
- Michael P. Johnson
- Arthur P. Hurter
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
As result of public housing reform and welfare reform, the operating environment of public housing authorities has changed significantly. Given these policy initiatives, housing mobility programs represent viable strategies for providing public housing residents with access to economically healthy, integrated neighborhoods.

## 6. Interactive Multiobjective Group Decision Making with Interval Parameters
### Author(s):
- Zaharias Xanthopulos
- Emanuel Melachrinoudis
- Marius M. Solomon
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new framework for the solution of interactive multiobjective group decision-making problems with interval parameters. Its novelty stems from a learning phase where decision makers (DMs) explore the structural characteristics of the specific Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. This provides important and timely feedback to the DMs. Its core consists of four indices and their relationships.

## 7. Coordination of Pricing and Multiple-Period Production Across Multiple Constant Priced Goods
### Author(s):
- Stephen M. Gilbert
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of jointly determining prices and production schedules for a set of items that are produced on the same production equipment. Under the assumptions that the production setup costs are negligible and that demand is seasonal but price dependent, we exploit the special structure of the problem to develop a solution procedure. Through a set of numerical examples, we demonstrate how a product's contribution to aggregate seasonality can increase its optimal price. Our examples also demonstrate that, among products that experience demand peaks during the firm's busy season, those that peak early in the busy season should be priced more aggressively than those that peak later.

## 8. Price-Endings When Prices Signal Quality
### Author(s):
- Mark Stiving
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
This paper provides a theoretical explanation for why firms behave as though they use round prices to signal quality. By replacing the linear demand curve in Bagwell and Riordan's (1991) price as a signal of quality model with a kinked demand curve, and analyzing what price endings firms are most likely to use, the following observations can be made: (1) Firms that are using high prices to signal quality are more likely to set those prices at round numbers, and (2) price-endings themselves are not necessarily signals of quality. A simulation was conducted to demonstrate that these findings generally hold true even in the presence of demand spikes at 9-ending prices (e.g., Schindler and Kibarian 1996). Finally, empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that firms tend to use more round prices for higherquality products, and that this relationship is even stronger for product categories where consumers are less able to detect the true level of quality prior to purchase.

## 9. Optimal Models for Meal-Break and Start-Time Flexibility in Continuous Tour Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Michael J. Brusco
- Larry W. Jacobs
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2000
### Abstract:
This paper presents a compact integer-programming model for large-scale continuous tour scheduling problems that incorporate meal-break window, start-time band, and start-time interval policies. For practical scheduling environments, generalized set-covering formulations (GSCFs) of such problems often contain hundreds of millions of integer decision variables, usually precluding identification of optimal solutions. As an alternative, we present an implicit integer-programming model that frequently has fewer than 1,500 variables and can be formulated and solved using PC-based hardware and software platforms. An empirical study using labor-requirement distributions for customer service representatives at a Motorola, Inc. call center was used to demonstrate the importance of having a model that can evaluate tradeoffs among the various scheduling policies.
