## 4. Path Generation for Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation of Mortgage-Backed Securities

### Abstract:
Monte Carlo simulation is playing an increasingly important role in the pricing and hedging of complex, path dependent financial instruments. Low discrepancy simulation methods offer the potential to provide faster rates of convergence than those of standard Monte Carlo methods; however, in high dimensional problems special methods are required to ensure that the faster convergence rates hold. Indeed, Ninomiya and Tezuka (1996) have shown highdimensional examples, in which low discrepancy methods perform worse than Monte Carlo methods. The principal component construction introduced by Acworth et al. (1998) provides one solution to this problem. However, the computational effort required to generate each path grows quadratically with the dimension of the problem. This article presents two new methods that offer accuracy equivalent, in terms of explained variability, to the principal components construction with computational requirements that are linearly related to the problem dimension. One method is to take into account knowledge about the payoff function, which makes it more flexible than the Brownian Bridge construction. Numerical results are presented that show the benefits of such adjustments. The different methods are compared for the case of pricing mortgage backed securities using the Hull-White term structure model.

## 5. Risk-Constrained Dynamic Active Portfolio Management
### Author(s):
- Sid Browne
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2000
### Abstract:
Active portfolio management is concerned with objectives related to the outperformance of the return of a target benchmark portfolio. In this paper, we consider a dynamic active portfolio management problem where the objective is related to the tradeoff between the achievement of performance goals and the risk of a shortfall. Specifically, we consider an objective that relates the probability of achieving a given performance objective to the time it takes to achieve the objective. This allows a new direct quantitative analysis of the risk/return tradeoff, with risk defined directly in terms of probability of shortfall relative to the benchmark, and return defined in terms of the expected time to reach investment goals relative to the benchmark. The resulting optimal policy is a state-dependent policy that provides new insights. As a special case, our analysis includes the case where the investor wants to minimize the expected time until a given performance goal is reached subject to a constraint on the shortfall probability.

## 6. Management of Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Infection: Analyzing When to Change Therapy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2000
### Abstract:
We analyze two joint decisions in the management of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy: how frequently to measure a patient's virus level, and when to switch therapy. The underlying stochastic model captures the initial suppression and eventual rebound of the virus level in the blood of a typical HIV-infected patient undergoing treatment. We consider two classes of policies: a viral load policy, which triggers a change in therapy when the current virus level divided by the smallest level achieved thus far exceeds a prespecified threshold, and a proactive policy, which is similar to the viral load policy but also switches drugs at a prespecified time if no evidence of viral rebound has been seen. We find approximate analytical expressions for the probability of switching before the virus reaches its nadir (minimum value) and the mean delay in detection of viral rebound (i.e., the time interval from when the viral nadir occurs until the switch in therapy). Numerical results show that the proactive policy outperforms (i.e., a smaller detection delay for a given probability of prenadir switching) the viral load policy and recent recommendations by an expert AIDS panel, and may delay the onset of multidrug resistance in a significant proportion of patients who experience drug failure.

## 7. Variance Reduction via Lattice Rules
### Author(s):

- Christiane Lemieux
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2000
### Abstract:
This is a review article on lattice methods for multiple integration over the unit hypercube, with a variance-reduction viewpoint. It also contains some new results and ideas. The aim is to examine the basic principles supporting these methods and how they can be used effectively for the simulation models that are typically encountered in the area of management science. These models can usually be reformulated as integration problems over the unit hypercube with a large (sometimes infinite) number of dimensions. We examine selection criteria for the lattice rules and suggest criteria which take into account the quality of the projections of the lattices over selected low-dimensional subspaces. The criteria are strongly related to those used for selecting linear congruential and multiple recursive random number generators. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

## 8. A Heavy Traffic Approximation for Workload Processes with Heavy Tailed Service Requirements
### Author(s):
- Sidney Resnick
- Gennady Samorodnitsky
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2000
### Abstract:
A system with heavy tailed service requirements under heavy load having a single server has an equilibrium waiting time distribution which is approximated by the Mittag-Leffler distribution. This fact is understood by a direct analysis of the weak convergence of a sequence of negative drift random walks with heavy right tail and the associated all time maxima of these random walks. This approach complements the recent transform view of Boxma and Cohen (1997).

## 9. Price and Service Discrimination in Queuing Systems: Incentive Compatibility of Gcμ Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Jan A. Van Mieghem
### Published:
- 1 Sep 2000
### Abstract:
This article studies the optimal prices and service quality grades that a queuing system—the “firm”—provides to heterogeneous, utility-maximizing customers who measure quality by their experienced delay distributions. Results are threefold: First, delay cost curves are introduced that allow for a flexible description of a customer's quality sensitivity. Second, a comprehensive executable approach is proposed that analytically specifies scheduling, delay distributions and prices for arbitrary delay sensitivity curves. The tractability of this approach derives from porting heavy-traffic Brownian results into the economic analysis. The generalized cμ (Gcμ) scheduling rule that emerges is dynamic so that, in general, service grades need not correspond to a static priority ranking. A benchmarking example investigates the value of differentiated service. Third, the notions of grade and rate incentive compatibility (IC) are introduced to study this system under asymmetric information and are established for Gcμ scheduling when service times are homogeneous and customers atomistic. Grade IC induces correct grade choice resulting in perfect service discrimination; rate IC additionally induces centralized-optimal rates. Dynamic Gcμ scheduling exhibits negative feedback that, together with time-dependent pricing, can also yield rate incentive compatibility with heterogeneous service times. Finally, multiplan pricing, which offers all customers a menu with a choice of multiple rate plans, is analyzed.
