## 1. An Alternating Recognition Model of English Auctions

### Abstract:
We present an alternative abstraction of an English (oral ascending) auction to the standard, in Milgrom and Weber (1982), that accords more closely with practices in some auction markets. In particular, the assumptions that exits are irrevocable and necessarily public are dropped, making endogenous the decision to compete silently and privately, or openly. In the model, the price rises in a stylization of an auctioneer alternately recognizing two bidders who affirm willingness to pay the current price. The auctioneer pays attention to other bidders only when a recognized bidder exits. Such exits may be temporary, although we construct an equilibrium in which there is no benefit to exit and reentry. The number of public exits is stochastic; frequently a losing bidder will remain silent, giving no indication of his willingness to pay, and hence yielding no useful inference about his private information. Thus, the source of the expected revenue advantage of English auctions over second-price auctions is only stochastically available. Moreover, when public exits are incomplete, the ordinal rank of the bidder whose private information can be inferred is unknown, making that information less valuable. Consequently, the simpler formula for expected revenue in second-price auctions may be the preferred approximation for English auctions.

## 2. Predecisional Distortion of Information by Auditors and Salespersons

### Abstract:
As people are deciding between two alternatives, they may distort new information to support whichever alternative is tentatively preferred. The presence of such predecisional distortion of information was tested in decisions made by two groups of professionals, auditors and salespersons. Both groups exhibited substantial distortion of information, with little reduction for professional decisions compared to nonprofessional ones. However, auditors' distortion was significantly smaller than that of salespersons. In addition, holding professionals accountable for their decisions, akin to a supervisory review, lowered distortion somewhat for salespersons but not at all for auditors. The latter seemed to act as if they were always being held accountable. Because people seem unaware that they are distorting information, at least at the moment this bias is occurring, they are fully convinced of the soundness of their choices. This may make it difficult for distortion to be detected by decision makers themselves or even by supervisors who cannot completely duplicate their subordinate's knowledge.

## 3. What's Experience Got to Do With It? Sources of Cost Reduction in a Large Specialty Chemicals Producer
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
Conventional learning curves relating unit cost to measures of production experience are estimated for 221 specialty chemicals produced by a Fortune 500 company. Detailed records on cost and RD coupled with insights from company personnel are used to explain the variation across products in the rate of cost reduction. Products that exhibited the strongest relationship between unit cost and measures of production experience were subject to specific initiatives, particularly process RD. The RD was not, however, generally motivated or informed, by production experience. However, cumulative past output, the most commonly used measure of production experience, was related to expected future output, which conditioned the expected future returns from RD and the choice of RD projects. Thus, cumulative output was connected to unit costs through its role in conditioning incentives to undertake process RD rather than as a proxy for production experience. This suggests that the strong relationship commonly found between unit cost and measures of production experience may reflect incentives to reduce cost as much as learning from production experience.

## 4. A Discrete-Time Approach to Arbitrage-Free Pricing of Credit Derivatives
### Author(s):
- Sanjiv Ranjan Das
- Rangarajan K. Sundaram
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
This paper develops a framework for modelling risky debt and valuing credit derivatives that is flexible and simple to implement, and that is, to the maximum extent possible, based on observables. Our approach is based on expanding the Heath-Jarrow-Morton term-structure model to allow for defaultable debt. Rather than follow the procedure of implying out the behavior of spreads from assumptions concerning the default process, we work directly with the evolution of spreads. The risk-neutral drifts in the resulting model possess a recursive representation that facilitates implementation and makes it possible to handle path-dependence and early exercise features without difficulty. The framework permits embedding a variety of specifications for default; we present an empirical example of a default structure which provides promising calibration results.

## 5. Shifts of Reference Points for Framing of Strategic Decisions and Changing Risk-Return Associations
### Author(s):
- Johannes M. Lehner
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
Previous results on nonlinear risk-return associations, predicted by prospect theory, are replicated with mean quadratic differences instead of variance as a measure of risk. In contrast to assumptions of these studies, results with a sample from the COMPUSTAT-database provide evidence that at least a minority of firms shift to individual reference levels, which are represented here through levels of minimal risk. Further, changes of environmental conditions as an alternative explanation for switching risk-return relationships are tested against prospect theory predictions. It is shown that risk-return relationships remain stable as long as the relative position to the individual reference level is stable. This explains switching risk-return relationships better than changing environmental conditions.

## 6. Stock Rationing in an M/Ek/1 Make-to-Stock Queue
### Author(s):
- Albert Y. Ha
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
This paper considers the stock rationing problem of a single-item, make-to-stock production system with several demand classes and lost sales. When demand is Poisson and processing time has an Erlang distribution, we show that a single-state variable called work storage level can be employed to completely capture the information regarding inventory level and the status of current production. The optimal rationing policy can be characterized by a sequence of monotone critical work storage levels. For each demand class, there exists a work storage level at or below which it is optimal to start rejecting the demand of this class in anticipation of future arrival of higher-priority demands. The optimal production policy can also be characterized by a critical work storage level. Our numerical examples indicate that a critical stock level policy, which ignores information on the status of current production, performs very well.

## 7. Attribute Conflict and Preference Uncertainty: Effects on Judgment Time and Error
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
This research investigates preference uncertainty generated as a function of specific alternative characteristics during multiattribute evaluative judgments. We propose that preference uncertainty has at least two behavioral manifestations: longer judgment times and greater response error in expressed preferences. We investigate two hypotheses regarding stimulus-based causes of preference uncertainty. As predicted by our attribute conflict hypothesis, greater within-alternative conflict (discrepancy among the attributes of an evaluative alternative) led to longer judgment times and greater response error. As predicted by our attribute extremity hypothesis, greater attribute extremity (very high or low attribute values) resulted in shorter judgment times and less response error. We also found that judgment times and response errors were strongly positively correlated at the item level, consistent with our assumption that preference uncertainty generated by stimulus characteristics is manifested in judgment time and error. Finally, we found that the item-level preference uncertainty effects proposed here operate in parallel with strategy-level, effort-accuracy tradeoffs observable across participants. These findings are consistent with the RandMAU random multiattribute utility model developed in a companion article by Fischer et al. (2000).

## 8. Heuristic Computation of Periodic-Review Base Stock Inventory Policies
### Author(s):
- Robin O. Roundy
- John A. Muckstadt
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
We study the problem of determining production quantities in each period of an infinite horizon for a single item produced in a capacity-limited facility. The demand for the product is random, and it is independent and identically distributed from period to period. The demand is observed at the beginning of a time period, but it need not be filled until the end of the period. Unfilled demand is backordered. A base stock or order-up-to policy is used. The shortfall is the order-up-to level minus the inventory position. The inventory system is easily understood and managed if we know the distribution of the shortfall. We develop a new approximation for this distribution, and perform extensive computational tests of existing approximations. Our new approximation works extremely well as long as the coefficient of variation of the demand is less than two. For practical applications this is by far the most interesting case. No known approximations work well consistently when the coefficient of variation of the demand is greater than two.

## 9. Processes and Their Frameworks
### Author(s):
- Kenneth D. Mackenzie
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
A process is a time-dependent sequence of events governed by a process framework. A group process has five components: the entities performing the process, the steps or elements of a process, the relationship between any pair of elements, the links to other processes, and the resources and their characteristics-in-use involved with the elements. A process framework is denoted by Y = F(C) where Y is the set of outcomes or consequences of a process, C is the set of considerations or elements in the process, and F is the network linking the considerations to each other and to the outcomes. The properties of the set of considerations, the linkages between pairs of consequences, the set of outcomes or consequences, the network, F, and the use of process frameworks are discussed in detail with examples. Process models are compared to variable models.

## 10. A Survey of Algorithms for Convex Multicommodity Flow Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
Routing problems appear frequently when dealing with the operation of communication or transportation networks. Among them, the message routing problem plays a determinant role in the optimization of network performance. Much of the motivation for this work comes from this problem which is shown to belong to the class of nonlinear convex multicommodity flow problems. This paper emphasizes the message routing problem in data networks, but it includes a broader literature overview of convex multicommodity flow problems. We present and discuss the main solution techniques proposed for solving this class of large-scale convex optimization problems. We conduct some numerical experiments on the message routing problem with four different techniques.

## 11. Three Scheduling Algorithms Applied to the Earth Observing Systems Domain
### Author(s):
- William J. Wolfe
- Stephen E. Sorensen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 2000
### Abstract:
This paper describes three approaches to assigning tasks to earth observing satellites (EOS). A fast and simple priority dispatch method is described and shown to produce acceptable schedules most of the time. A look ahead algorithm is then introduced that outperforms the dispatcher by about 12% with only a small increase in run time. These algorithms set the stage for the introduction of a genetic algorithm that uses job permutations as the population. The genetic approach presented here is novel in that it uses two additional binary variables, one to allow the dispatcher to occasionally skip a job in the queue and another to allow the dispatcher to occasionally allocate the worst position to the job. These variables are included in the recombination step in a natural way. The resulting schedules improve on the look ahead by as much as 15% at times and 3% on average. We define and use the window-constrained packing problem to model the bare bones of the EOS scheduling problem.
