### Abstract:
In today's multibrand, multichannel marketplace, optimal channel design involves issues such as distribution intensity, channel exclusivity, vertical and horizontal coordination, and online–offline mixed structures. We investigate how a firm's choice in these design issues affects its profitability under varying levels of brand and outlet differentiation. Our spatial model explicitly captures heterogeneous consumer preference for brand position, store location, and outlet type, under various consumer behavior assumptions. We apply this same underlying model to 10 different channel structures, deriving associated demand functions and equilibrium solutions. We perform a meta-analysis over the entire set of results to estimate a general model that summarizes the linkages among the factors shaping optimal channel structure decisions in a multibrand, multioutlet market. This general model efficiently describes the complex interactions of channel characteristics with industry structure and consumer characteristics, providing new findings as well as greater clarity to some results in the literature. A predictive analysis applied to additional channel structures exhibits strong generalizability in qualitative findings.

## 4. Unpacking the Future: A Nudge Toward Wider Subjective Confidence Intervals

### Abstract:
Subjective probabilistic judgments in forecasting are inevitable in many real-life domains. A common way to obtain such judgments is to assess fractiles or confidence intervals. However, these judgments tend to be systematically overconfident. Further, it has proved particularly difficult to debias such forecasts and improve the calibration. This paper proposes a simple process that systematically leads to wider confidence intervals, thus reducing overconfidence. With a series of experiments, including with professionals, we show that unpacking the distal future into intermediate more proximal futures systematically improves calibration. We refer to this phenomenon as the time unpacking effect, find it is robust to different elicitation formats, and address the possible reasons behind it. We further show that this results in better overall forecasting performance when improved calibration is traded off against less sharpness, and that substantive benefits can be obtained even from just one level of time unpacking.

## 5. Insiders' Sales Under Rule 10b5-1 Plans and Meeting or Beating Earnings Expectations
### Author(s):
- John Shon
- Stanley Veliotis
### Published:
- 4 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
We find that firms with insider sales executed under Rule 10b5-1 plans exhibit a higher likelihood of meeting or beating analysts' earnings expectations (MBE). This relation between MBE and plan sales is more pronounced for the plan sales of chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs) and is nonexistent for other key insiders. The market reactions to firms that successfully meet or beat expectations are relatively positive compared with their peers that fail to do so. One interpretation of our results is that CEOs and CFOs who sell under these plans may be more likely to engage in strategic behavior to meet or beat expectations in an effort to maximize their proceeds from plan sales. However, readers should exercise caution in making inferences, because the potential presence of limit order transactions makes it difficult to unambiguously determine the direction of causality of the relation we document.

## 6. Organization and Bargaining: Sales Process Choice at Auto Dealerships
### Author(s):
- Victor Manuel Bennett
### Published:
- 18 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
This paper examines how firms' organizational form affects prices negotiated. Negotiated prices are one factor determining whether a vendor or customer captures the value from a transaction. Firms that systematically negotiate more effectively capture more value. Research has investigated individual- and market-level determinants of negotiation outcomes, but little has been done on the firm-level determinants of negotiated prices. I present a first look at one feature, sales process: whether salespeople handle the entire sale in parallel or customers begin with less experienced salespeople who can escalate difficult assignments. I model firms' choice of sales process as a biform game and test predictions of the model using a combination of transaction-level data on new car purchases in the United States and a unique survey of dealership management practices. I find that a serial process has implications consistent with improving firms' bargaining power and reducing customers' outside options.

## 7. Do Customers Learn from Experience? Evidence from Retail Banking
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 22 Apr 2013
### Abstract:
We study customers' adoption and subsequent switching decisions with regard to a menu of three-part tariff plans offered by a commercial bank. Using a rich panel data set covering 70,510 fee-based checking accounts over 30 months, before and after the introduction of the plans, we find that most customers adopt non-cost-minimizing plans, preferring plans with large monthly allowances and high fixed payments. Furthermore, after adoption, customers who exceed their allowances and consequently pay overage fees are more likely to switch to plans with larger allowances than customers who do not experience such fees. Notably, after switching, these overage-paying customers pay higher monthly payments than before. In contrast, switching customers who did not pay overage payments before switching pay less after switching. Our findings, unlike those of previous research on experience-based learning, suggest that the behavior of experienced customers does not converge to the predictions of neoclassical models. We propose that “overage aversion,” which is closely related to loss aversion and mental accounting, is the most plausible explanation for our findings.

## 8. Asset-Pricing Implications of Dividend Volatility

- 4 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
This paper establishes dividend volatility as a fundamental risk metric that prices assets. We theoretically incorporate dividend volatility clustering into a model in which narrow-framing investors are loss averse over fluctuations in the value of their investments. Our model shows that dividend volatility positively predicts future asset returns, with the predictive power increasing with the forecasting horizon; our model also sheds light on a variety of other asset-pricing phenomena. We further provide supporting empirical evidence that dividend volatility is indeed priced in the data. More specifically, aggregate dividend volatility predicts and is predicted by aggregate price-to-dividend ratios; aggregate dividend volatility predicts future aggregate market returns; and dividend volatility of portfolios sorted by size, book-to-market ratios, and past returns predicts future portfolio-level returns, respectively.

## 9. Geographic Constraints on Knowledge Spillovers: Political Borders vs. Spatial Proximity
### Author(s):
- Jasjit Singh

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2013
### Abstract:
Geographic localization of knowledge spillovers is a central tenet in multiple streams of research. However, prior work has typically examined this phenomenon considering only one geographic unit—country, state, or metropolitan area—at a time and has rarely accounted for spatial distance. We disentangle these multiple effects by using a regression framework employing choice-based sampling to estimate the likelihood of citation between random patents. We find both country and state borders to have independent effects on knowledge diffusion beyond what just geographic proximity in the form of metropolitan collocation or shorter within-region distances can explain. An identification methodology comparing inventor-added and examiner-added citation patterns points to an even stronger role of political borders. The puzzling state border effect remains robust on average across analyses, though it is found to have waned with time. The country effect has, in contrast, not only remained robust but even strengthened over time.

## 10. Inventory Management for an Assembly System Subject to Supply Disruptions
### Author(s):
- Gregory A. DeCroix
### Published:
- 4 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
We consider an assembly system with a single end product and a general assembly structure, where one or more of the component suppliers or (sub)assembly production processes is subject to random supply disruptions. We present a method for reducing the system to an equivalent system with some subsystems replaced by a series structure. This reduction simplifies the computation of optimal ordering policies and can also allow for comparison of disruption impacts across systems with different supply chain structures. We identify conditions under which a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy is optimal. Based on this result, we propose a heuristic policy for solving the assembly system with disruptions and test its performance in numerical trials. Using additional numerical trials, we explore a variety of strategic questions. For example, contrary to what is typically observed in systems without disruptions, we find that choosing a supplier with a longer lead time can sometimes yield lower system costs. We also find that backup supply is more valuable for a supplier with a shorter lead time than one with a longer lead time. In addition, because of component complementarities, we find that choosing suppliers whose disruptions are perfectly correlated yields lower system costs than choosing suppliers whose disruptions are independent, in contrast to the strategy that is typically preferred when choosing backup suppliers for a single product.

## 11. Price-Quoting Strategies of an Upstream Supplier
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Apr 2013
### Abstract:
This paper studies an upstream supplier who quotes prices for a key component to multiple sellers that compete for an end-buyer's indivisible contract. At most one of the supplier's quotes may result in downstream contracting and hence produce revenue for her. We characterize the supplier's optimal price-quoting strategies and show that she will use one of two possible types of strategies, with her choice depending on the sellers' profit potentials relative to their uncertainties: secure, whereby she will always have business; or risky, whereby she may not have business. Addressing potential fairness concerns, we also study price-quoting strategies in which all sellers receive equal quotes. Finally, we show that the supplier's optimal mechanism resembles auctioning a single quote among the sellers. This paper can assist upstream suppliers in their pricing decisions and provides general insights into multitier supply chains' pricing dynamics.

## 12. Contract Design with a Dominant Retailer and a Competitive Fringe
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 4 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
We show that under some conditions, quantity discounts and two-part tariffs are equivalent as mechanisms for channel coordination when an upstream firm sells its product in a downstream market that is characterized by a dominant retailer and a competitive fringe. We consider a setting in which discriminatory offers are feasible and a setting in which the same menu of options must be offered to all retailers. We find that the upstream firm's profit in both settings is independent of whether quantity discounts or two-part tariffs are used. The implication of this finding is that the firm's choice of contract design may turn on which one is easier to implement.

## 13. The Role of Risk Preferences in Pay-to-Bid Auctions
### Author(s):
- Brennan C. Platt

- Henry Tappen
### Published:
- 4 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
We analyze a new auction format in which bidders pay a fee each time they increase the auction price. Bidding fees are the primary source of revenue for the seller but produce the same expected revenue as standard auctions (assuming risk-neutral bidders). If risk-loving preferences are incorporated in the model, expected revenue increases. Our model predicts a particular distribution of ending prices, which we test against observed auction data. The degree of fit depends on how unobserved parameters are chosen; in particular, a slight preference for risk has the biggest impact in explaining auction behavior, suggesting that pay-to-bid auctions are a mild form of gambling.

## 14. Demand Uncertainty and Excess Supply in Commodity Contracting
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 15 Feb 2013
### Abstract:
We examine how different characteristics of product demand and market impact the relative sales volume in the forward and spot markets for a commodity whose aggregate demand is uncertain. In a setting where either the forward contracts are binding quantity commitments between buyers and suppliers or the forward production takes place before the uncertainty in demand is resolved, we find that a combination of factors that include market concentration, demand risk, and price elasticity of demand will determine whether a commodity will be sold mainly through forward contracts or in the spot market. Previous findings in the literature show that when participants are risk neutral, the ratio of forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone; also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. These findings hold under the assumption that demand is either deterministic or, if demand is uncertain, all production takes place after uncertainty is fully resolved and production plans can be altered instantaneously and costlessly. In our setting, however, we find that even a low level of demand risk can reverse the nature of supply in a highly competitive (low concentration) market, by shifting it from predominantly forward-driven to predominantly spot-driven supply. In markets with high concentration, the price elasticity of demand will determine whether the supply will be predominantly spot-driven or forward-driven. Our analysis suggests various new hypotheses on the structure of supply in commodity markets.

## 15. Is There One Unifying Concept of Utility?An Experimental Comparison of Utility Under Risk and Utility Over Time
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Mar 2013
### Abstract:
The nature of utility is controversial. Whereas decision theory commonly assumes that utility is context specific, applied and empirical decision analysis typically assumes one unifying concept of utility applicable to all decision problems. This controversy has hardly been addressed empirically because of the absence of methods to measure utility outside the context of risk. We introduce a method to measure utility over time and compare utility under risk and utility over time. We distinguish between gains and losses and also measure loss aversion. In two experiments we found that utility under risk and utility over time differed and were uncorrelated. Utility under risk was more curved than utility over time. Subjects were loss averse both for risk and for time, but loss aversion was more pronounced for risk. Loss aversion over risk and time were uncorrelated. This suggests that loss aversion, although important in both decision contexts, is volatile and subject to framing.

## 16. Mixed Bundling of Two Independently Valued Goods
### Author(s):
- Hemant K. Bhargava
### Published:
- 15 Feb 2013
### Abstract:
This paper develops analytical results and insights for the mixed bundling problem of pricing a product line consisting of two component goods (with valuations distributed uniformly and independently in [0, a1] and [0, a2], respectively, with a1 ≤ a2) and a bundle of the two goods. This setting has previously been considered analytically intractable. By deriving component good prices as exact algebraic functions of the optimal bundle price, I reduce the multiproduct pricing problem to a univariate nonlinear optimization problem in the bundle price. When the two component goods are sufficiently asymmetric in valuations, the optimal solution is partial mixed bundling (one component good is not sold separately), for which I derive exact conditions and optimal prices. An exact analytical solution is also given for mixed bundling of two information goods (component goods with zero marginal costs). For the general case, I derive a closed-form approximation of the optimal bundle price: pB = 0.5724w1 + 0.5695w2 + 0.3516a1 + 0.4889a2 + 0.0054(a2/a1)w1−0.0201(a2/a1)w2. The approximation is highly accurate (the resulting profit is within a percent of the exact optimal profit), efficient (instant solutions for specific problem instances), and useful in other applications where mixed bundling is a subproblem. I demonstrate this by applying the solution to the mixed bundle problem in a vertical channel where a retailer must bundle and price component goods from multiple independent manufacturers.
