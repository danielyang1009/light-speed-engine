## 1. Sharing the Wealth: When Should Firms Treat Customers as Partners?
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Marketers often stress the importance of treating customers as partners. A fundamental premise of this perspective is that all parties can be weakly better off if they work together to increase joint surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. For marketing managers, this implies organizing marketing activities in a manner that maximizes total surplus. This logic is theoretically sound when agreements between partners are limitless and costless. In most consumer marketing contexts (business-to-consumer), this is typically not true. The question I ask is should one still expect firms to partner with consumers and reach Pareto-efficient agreements? In this paper, I use the example of a firm's choice of product configuration to demonstrate two effects. First, I show that a firm may configure a product in a manner that reduces total surplus but increases firm profits. Second, one might conjecture that increased competition would eliminate this effect, but I show that in a duopoly firm profits may be increasing in the cost of product completion. This second result suggests that firms may prefer to remain inefficient and/or stifie innovations. Both results violate a fundamental premise of partnering—that firms and consumers should work together to increase total surplus and reach Pareto-efficient agreements. The model illustrates that Pareto-efficient agreements are less likely to occur if negotiation with individual partners is infeasible or costly, such as in business-to–consumer contexts. Consumer marketers in one-to- many marketing environments should be wary of treating customers as partners because Pareto–efficient agreements may not be optimal for their firm.

## 2. David vs. Goliath: An Analysis of Asymmetric Mixed-Strategy Games and Experimental Evidence

### Abstract:
Mixed strategies are widely used to model strategic situations in diverse fields such as economics, marketing, political science, and biology. However, some of the implications of asymmetric mixed-strategy solutions are counterintuitive. We develop a stylized model of patent race to examine some of these implications. In our model two firms compete to develop a product and obtain a patent. However, one firm values the patent more because of its market advantages, such as brand reputation and distribution network. Contrary to some intuition, we find that the firm that values the patent less is likely to invest more aggressively in developing the product and will also win the patent more often. We argue that the reason for these counterintuitive results is inherent in the very concept of mixed strategy solution. In a laboratory test, we examine whether subjects' behavior conforms to the equilibrium predictions. We find that the aggregate behavior of our subjects is consistent with the game-theoretic predictions. With the help of the experience-weighted attraction (EWA) learning model proposed by Camerer and Ho (1999), we show that adaptive learning can account for the investment behavior of our subjects.We find that the EWA learning model tracks the investment decisions of our subjects well, whether we hold out trials or an entire group of subjects.

## 3. Supply Chain Coordination Under Channel Rebates with Sales Effort Effects
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
A channel rebate is a payment from a manufacturer to a retailer based on retailer sales to end consumers. Two common forms of channel rebates are linear rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold, and target rebates, in which the rebate is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed target rebate achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear rebate in a way that is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed target rebate and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome. Other contracts, such as linear rebate and returns or target rebate alone, cannot achieve coordination in a way that is implementable. Contrary to the view expressed in the literature that accepting returns weakens incentives for retailer sales effort, we find that the provision of returns strengthens incentives for effort.

## 4. On Uncertainty, Ambiguity, and Complexity in Project Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2002
### Abstract:
This article develops a model of a project as a payoff function that depends on the state of the world and the choice of a sequence of actions. A causal mapping, which may be incompletely known by the project team, represents the impact of possible actions on the states of the world. An underlying probability space represents available information about the state of the world. Interactions among actions and states of the world determine the complexity of the payoff function. Activities are endogenous, in that they are the result of a policy that maximizes the expected project payoff.

## 5. The Market Evolution and Sales Takeoff of Product Innovations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2002
### Abstract:
In contrast to the prevailing supply-side explanation that price decreases are the key driver of a sales takeoff, we argue that outward shifting supply and demand curves lead to market takeoff. Our fundamental idea is that sales in new markets are initially low because the first commercialized forms of new innovations are primitive. Then, as new firms enter, actual and perceived product quality improves (and prices possibly drop), which leads to a takeoff in sales. To provide empirical evidence for this explanation, we explore the relationship between takeoff times, price decreases, and firm entry for a sample of consumer and industrial product innovations commercialized in the United States over the past 150 years. Based on a proportional hazards analysis of takeoff times, we find that new firm entry dominates other factors in explaining observed sales takeoff times. We interpret these results as supporting the idea that demand shifts during the early evolution of a new market due to nonprice factors is the key driver of a sales takeoff.

## 6. Performance Assessment of the Lead User Idea-Generation Process for New Product Development

### Abstract:
Traditional idea generation techniques based on customer input usually collect information on new product needs from a random or typical set of customers. The “lead user process” takes a different approach. It collects information about both needs and solutions from users at the leading edges of the target market, as well as from users in other markets that face similar problems in a more extreme form. This paper reports on a natural experiment conducted within the 3M Company on the effect of the lead user (LU) idea-generation process relative to more traditional methods. 3M is known for its innovation capabilities— and we find that the LU process appears to improve upon those capabilities. Annual sales of LU product ideas generated by the average LU project at 3M are conservatively projected to be $146 million after five years—more than eight times higher than forecast sales for the average contemporaneously conducted “traditional” project. Each funded LU project is projected to create a new major product line for a 3M division. As a direct result, divisions funding LU project ideas are projecting their highest rate of major product line generation in the past 50 years.

## 7. Managerial Insights into the Effects of Interactions on Replacing Members of a Team
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2002
### Abstract:
A mathematical model is presented for studying the effects of interactions among team members on the process of replacing members of a team in an organization. The model provides the ability to control the number of members that interact with each individual on the team. Through the use of analysis and computer simulations, it is shown how the amount of interaction affects the tradeoff between the expected performance and the number of replacements and interviews needed to find a good team using various replacement policies. New managerial insights into this process—such as the fact that it is not necessarily optimal to replace the worst-performing team member—are provided.

## 8. Preferred by “All” and Preferred by “Most” Decision Makers: Almost Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 2002
### Abstract:
While “most” decision makers may prefer one uncertain prospect over another, stochastic dominance rules as well as other investment criteria, will not reveal this preference due to some extreme utility functions in the case of even a very small violation of these rules. Such strict rules relate to “all” utility functions in a given class including extreme ones which presumably rarely represents investors' preference. In this paper we establish almost stochastic dominance (ASD) rules which formally reveal a preference for “most” decision makers, but not for “all” of them. The ASD rules reveal that choices which probably conform with “most” decision makers also solve some debates, e.g., showing, as practitioners claim, an ASD preference for a higher proportion of stocks in the portfolio as the investment horizon increases, a conclusion which is not implied by the well-known stochastic dominance rules.

## 9. A Jump-Diffusion Model for Option Pricing
### Author(s):
- S. G. Kou
### Published:
- 1 Aug 2002
### Abstract:
Brownian motion and normal distribution have been widely used in the Black–Scholes option-pricing framework to model the return of assets. However, two puzzles emerge from many empirical investigations: the leptokurtic feature that the return distribution of assets may have a higher peak and two (asymmetric) heavier tails than those of the normal distribution, and an empirical phenomenon called “volatility smile” in option markets. To incorporate both of them and to strike a balance between reality and tractability, this paper proposes, for the purpose of option pricing, a double exponential jump-diffusion model. In particular, the model is simple enough to produce analytical solutions for a variety of option-pricing problems, including call and put options, interest rate derivatives, and path-dependent options. Equilibrium analysis and a psychological interpretation of the model are also presented.
