### Abstract:
We take a structural approach to assessing innovation. We develop a comprehensive set of measures to assess an innovation's locus, type, and characteristics. We find that the concepts of competence destroying and competence enhancing are composed of two distinct constructs that, although correlated, separately characterize an innovation: new competence acquisition and competence enhancement/destruction. We develop scales to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types. We show that innovations can be evaluated distinctively on these various dimensions with generally small correlations between them. We estimate the impact these different innovation characteristics and types have on time to introduction and perceived commercial success. Our results indicate the importance of taking a structural approach to describing innovations and to the differential importance of innovation locus, type, and characteristics on innovation outcomes. Our results also raise intriguing questions regarding the locus of competence acquisition (internal vs. external) and both innovation outcomes.

### Abstract:
Online information servers that provide access to diverse databases where users can search for, browse through, and download the information they need have been rapidly increasing in number in the past few years. Online vendors have traditionally charged users for information on the based on the length of the time they were connected to the databases. With hardware and software advances, many online servers have recently started changing their pricing strategies to search-based and/or subscription-fee pricing. This paper examines the various issues involved in pricing these information products, and presents an economic approach to analyze conditions under which the various pricing schemes may prove optimal for the online servers. Our results show that the variation in consumer expertise and valuation of information affects the choice of a pricing strategy by the server. We present general conditions under which subscription-fee pricing is optimal even when consumer demand is inelastic. We also find that, given the cost structures characterizing the market, undifferentiated online servers can compete and coexist in the market each making positive profits. We show that in a competitive setting an increase in costs of online servers can sometimes benefit them by enabling them to differentiate themselves. Our results offer insights into the trends in pricing strategies and may provide an explanation as to why many servers may persist with connect-time strategies.

## 3. Competitive One-to-One Promotions

### Abstract:
One-to-one promotions are possible when consumers are individually addressable and firms know something about each customer's preferences. We explore the competitive effects of one-to-one promotions in a model with two competing firms where the firms differ in size and consumers have heterogeneous brand loyalty. We find that one-to-one promotions always lead to an increase in price competition (average prices in the market decrease). However, we also find that one-to-one promotions affect market shares. This market-share effect may outweigh the effect of lower prices, benefiting the firm whose market share increases. Our results suggest that of two firms, the firm with the higher-quality product may gain from one-to-one promotions. Our model also has implications for the phenomenon of customer churn, where consumers switch to a less preferred brand due to targeted promotional incentives. We show that churning can arise optimally from firms pursuing a profit-maximizing strategy. Instead of trying to minimize it, the optimal way to manage customer churn is to engage in both offensive and defensive promotions with the relative mix depending on the marginal cost of targeting.

## 4. Should Start-up Companies Be Cautious? Inventory Policies Which Maximise Survival Probabilities

### Abstract:
New start-up companies, which are considered to be a vital ingredient in a successful economy, have a different objective than established companies: They want to maximise their chance of long-term survival. We examine the implications for their operating decisions of this different criterion by considering an abstraction of the inventory problem faced by a start-up manufacturing company. The problem is modelled under two criteria as a Markov decision process; the characteristics of the optimal policies under the two criteria are compared. It is shown that although the start-up company should be more conservative in its component purchasing strategy than if it were a well-established company, it should not be too conservative. Nor is its strategy monotone in the amount of capital it has available. The models are extended to allow for interest on investment and inflation.

## 5. Deconstructing the Pioneer's Advantage: Examining Vintage Effects and Consumer Valuations of Quality and Variety

### Abstract:
Several studies have demonstrated an order-of-entry effect on market share, suggesting that pioneers outperform later entrants. However, other research has pointed out the limitations of these studies and found evidence that many pioneers fail or have low market share. Given this background, the purpose of this research is to understand the conditions under which pioneers are more likely and also less likely to have an advantage. We propose a game-theoretic model that includes important sources of pioneer advantages as well as disadvantages. Specifically, we incorporate a pioneer advantage due to preemption in markets with heterogeneous tastes. In addition, we incorporate a potential pioneer disadvantage due to technology vintage effects, where later entrants utilizing improved technology can have lower costs and higher quality. The model allows us to evaluate the extent of vintage effects necessary to overcome a pioneer's advantage. Key relationships are found between the magnitude of the pioneer advantage or disadvantage and consumer valuations of product attributes (e.g., variety and quality). We empirically validate the model with vintage effect data in 36 product categories, and measures of consumer valuations of product variety and quality for 12 of these 36 categories. The results show that pioneers do better in product categories where variety is more important and worse in categories where product quality is more important. Pioneers in categories with high vintage effects are shown to have lower market shares and higher failure rates. Similar results appear when analyzing persistence of market leadership over time, further validating our model's major implications. We also present two case studies that illustrate key elements of the model.

## 6. Information Sharing in a Supply Chain with Horizontal Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2002
### Abstract:
This paper examines the incentives for firms to share information vertically in a two-level supply chain in which there are an upstream firm (a manufacturer) and many downstream firms (retailers). The retailers are engaged in a Cournot competition and are endowed with some private information. Vertical information sharing has two effects: "direct effect" due to the changes in strategy by the parties involved in sharing the information and "indirect effect" (or "leakage effect") due to the changes in strategy by other competing firms (who may infer the information from the actions of the informed parties). Both changes would affect the profitability of the firms. We show that the leakage effect discourages the retailers from sharing their demand information with the manufacturer while encouraging them to share their cost information. On the other hand, the direct effect always discourages the retailers from sharing their information. When voluntary information sharing is not possible, we identify conditions under which information can be traded and show how price should be determined to facilitate such information exchange. We also examine the impact of vertical information sharing on the total supply chain profits and social benefits.

## 7. Easy Quantification of Improved Spare Parts Inventory Policies

### Abstract:
This paper presents approximate analytical models to quantify the expected improvement in inventory investment when using a system approach to control inventory as opposed to a simpler item approach. A system approach ensures that a demand-weighted average fill rate is achieved at low inventory investment by assigning low fill rates to parts with high costs and high fill rates to parts with low costs. An item approach does not vary fill rates by parts but assigns identical fill rates to all parts. Using single-parameter functional representations of the skewness of unit costs and average demand across all parts in the system, simple approximate analytical expressions for the required inventory investment are derived for both approaches. The accuracy of the approximations is validated using data from a distribution center for computer spare parts. For these data, the solutions obtained by the approximations are very close to the exact values. The results show that inventory investments can be well approximated as a function of only a few cost and demand parameters. These expressions can be used to determine the percentage reduction in inventory investment for a particular target demand-weighted average fill rate when the superior system approach is used instead of the item approach. For increased ease of use, the percentage reduction in inventory when using a system as opposed to an item approach is computed over a range of realistic values for the key parameters of the model and a quadratic expression is fitted to the data. This fitted expression provides rough guidelines for the anticipated improvement with very limited data needed, prior to detailed modeling or implementation.
