### Abstract:
Selecting program portfolios within a budget constraint is an important challenge in the management of new product development (NPD). Optimal portfolios are difficult to define because of the combinatorial complexity of project combinations. However, at the aggregate level of the strategic allocation of resources across product lines, investment in a program is not an all-or-nothing decision, but can be adjusted, resulting in a higher or lower program benefit (e.g., higher or lower quality). In some cases, resources can be adjusted even for individual projects.

### Abstract:
Researchers have recently been interested in studying the drivers of store-brand success as well as factors that motivate retailers to introduce store brands. In this paper, we study the effects of the introduction of a store-brand into a particular product category. Specifically, we are interested in the effect of store-brand introduction on the demand as well as on the supply side. On the demand side, we investigate the changes in preferences for the national brands and price elasticities in the category. On the supply side, we study the effects of the new entrant on the interactions between the national brand manufacturers and the retailer introducing the store brand, including how these interactions influence the retailer's pricing behavior. In doing so, we are also able to test whether the observed data are consistent with some of the commonly used assumptions regarding retailer pricing behavior. For the demand specification we use a random coefficients logit model that allows for consumer heterogeneity. The model parameters are estimated using aggregate data while explicitly accounting for endogeneity in retail prices.

## 3. New Product Innovation with Multiple Features and Technology Constraints

### Abstract:
We model a firm's decisions about product innovation, focusing on the extent to which features should be improved or changed in the succession of models that comprise a life cycle. We show that the structure of the internal and external environment in which a firm operates suggests when to innovate to the technology frontier. The criterion is maximization of the expected present value of profits during the life cycle. Computational studies complement the theoretical results and lead to insights about when to bundle innovations across features. The formalization was influenced by extensive interviews with managers in a high-technology firm that dominates its industry.

## 4. Aspiration-Level Adaptation in an American Financial Services Organization: A Field Study

### Abstract:
Using field data from an American financial services organization, we examined the effects of three important variables in Cyert and March's (1963) initial conceptualization of the aspiration-level adaptation process: The previous aspiration level, performance feedback, and social comparison. Past findings obtained in controlled contexts (Glynn et al. 1991; Lant 1992) have provided empirical support for the attainment discrepancy model (Lewin et al. 1944), which includes variables of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy (i.e., performance feedback). We replicated these findings in the field: The effects of the previous aspiration level and attainment discrepancy on the current aspiration levels were significant and positive. In addition, we investigated the effect of social comparison using a variable based on the difference between the performance of the focal unit and the performance of comparable others (Greve 1998). Based on the assumption that decision makers in organizations will expect to observe similar performance levels among those in the same comparison group (Wood 1989), we posited that the effect of social comparison would be negative, refiecting managerial efforts to reduce performance discrepancies among similar units. The empirical results supported the prediction from this reasoning. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for theory and research in organizational learning and the behavioral theory of the firm.

## 5. Strategic and Operational Benefits of Electronic Integration in B2B Procurement Processes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2002
### Abstract:
Our goal is to assess the strategic and operational benefits of electronic integration for industrial procurement. We conduct a field study with an industrial supplier and examine the drivers of performance of the procurement process. Our research quantifies both the operational and strategic impacts of electronic integration in a B2B procurement environment for a supplier. Additionally, we show that the customer also obtains substantial benefits from efficient procurement transaction processing. We isolate the performance impact of technology choice and ordering processes on both the trading partners. A significant finding is that the supplier derives large strategic benefits when the customer initiates the system and the supplier enhances the system's capabilities. With respect to operational benefits, we find that when suppliers have advanced electronic linkages, the order-processing system significantly increases benefits to both parties.

## 6. Competition and Outsourcing with Scale Economies
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Scale economies are commonplace in operations, yet because of analytical challenges, relatively little is known about how firms should compete in their presence. This paper presents a model of competition between two firms that face scale economies; (i.e., each firm's cost per unit of demand is decreasing in demand). A general framework is used, which incorporates competition between two service providers with price- and time-sensitive demand (a queuing game), and competition between two retailers with fixed-ordering costs and pricesensitive consumers (an Economic Order Quantity game). Reasonably general conditions are provided under which there exists at most one equilibrium, with both firms participating in the market. We demonstrate, in the context of the queuing game, that the lower cost firm in equilibrium may have a higher market share and a higher price, an enviable situation. We also allow each firm to outsource their production process to a supplier. Even if the supplier's technology is no better than the firms' technology and the supplier is required to establish dedicated capacity (so the supplier's scale can be no greater than either firm's scale), we show that the firms strictly prefer to outsource. We conclude that scale economies provide a strong motivation for outsourcing that has not previously been identified in the literature.

## 7. Prospect Theory: Much Ado About Nothing?
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Prospect theory is a paradigm challenging the expected utility paradigm. One of the fundamental components of prospect theory is the S-shaped value function. The value function is mainly justified by experimental investigation of the certainty equivalents of prospects confined either to the negative or to the positive domain, but not of mixed prospects, which characterize most actual investments. We conduct an experimental study with mixed prospects, using, for the first time, recently developed investment criteria called Prospect Stochastic Dominance (PSD) and Markowitz Stochastic Dominance (MSD). We reject the S-shaped value function, showing that at least 62%–76% of the subjects cannot be characterized by such preferences. We find support for the Markowitz utility function, which is a reversed S-shaped function—exactly the opposite of the prospect theory value function. It is possible that the previous results supporting the S-shaped value function are distorted because the prospects had only positive or only negative outcomes, presenting hypothetical situations which individuals do not usually face, and which are certainly not common in financial markets.

## 8. Augmenting Conjoint Analysis to Estimate Consumer Reservation Price
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 2002
### Abstract:
Consumer reservation price is a key concept in marketing and economics. Theoretically, this concept has been instrumental in studying consumer purchase decisions,competitive pricing strategies,and welfare economics. Managerially,knowledge of consumer reservation prices is critical for implementing many pricing tactics such as bundling,tar get promotions,nonlinear pricing,and one-to-one pricing,and for assessing the impact of marketing strategy on demand. Despite the practical and theoretical importance of this concept, its measurement at the individual level in a practical setting proves elusive.
