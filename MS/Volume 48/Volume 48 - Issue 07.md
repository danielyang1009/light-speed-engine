## 1. Shifting Innovation to Users via Toolkits
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
In the traditional new product development process, manufacturers first explore user needs and then develop responsive products. Developing an accurate understanding of a user need is not simple or fast or cheap, however. As a result, the traditional approach is coming under increasing strain as user needs change more rapidly, and as firms increasingly seek to serve “markets of one.”

## 2. What Do We Know About Variance in Accounting Profitability?

### Abstract:
In this paper, we analyze the variance of accounting profitability among a broad cross-section of forms in the American economy from 1981 to 1994. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the importance of year, industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects on accounting profitability among operating businesses across sectors. The findings indicate that industry and corporate-parent effects are important and related to one another. As expected, business-specific effects, which arise from competitive positioning and other factors, have a large influence on performance. The analysis reconciles the results of previous studies by exploring differences in method and data. We also identify the broad contributions and limitations of the research, and suggest avenues for further study. New approaches are necessary to generate significant insights about the relationships between industry, corporate-parent, and business influences on firm profitability.

## 3. Organization Design
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper attempts to explain organization structure based on optimal coordination of interactions among activities. The main idea is that each manager is capable of detecting and coordinating interactions only within his limited area of expertise. Only the CEO can coordinate company wide interactions. The optimal design of the organization trades off the costs and benefits of various configurations of managers. Our results consist of classifying the characteristics of activities and managerial costs that lead to the matrix organization, the functional hierarchy, the divisional hierarchy, or a fiat hierarchy. We also investigate the effect of changing the costs of various managers on the nature of the optimal organization, including the extent of centralization.

## 4. The Performance Effects of Congruence Between Product Competitive Strategies and Purchasing Management Design

### Abstract:
The objective of this study is to examine a performance contingency effect between product competitive strategy and organization design using an archival approach. Specifically, this study examines a sample of 194 firms from 20 industries based on the data collected by Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies (CAPS) in its benchmarking surveys between 1989-1994 and links the benchmarking data to the COMPUSTAT (Standard & Poor's) financial data of these firms. The results of the study reveal a contingency relationship among product competitive strategies, purchasing design characteristics, and overall firm financial performance (return on assets). Specifically, the nature of this contingency relationship suggests that a firm's product competitive strategy must be enabled with a complementary design in purchasing management to promote firm performance. Given the growing practice of benchmarking at the functional level, this study also examines whether or not a firm achieving a congruency in product strategy and design will necessarily enjoy higher operational efficiency at the purchasing management level. The results show that this is true only under specific conditions. The implications of the preceding findings are discussed accordingly.

## 5. Project Assignment Rights and Incentives for Eliciting Ideas
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study an incentive problem that arises between a principal and two agents because they value a real option differently. The real option in our model is a timing option. The agents have limited capacity to undertake projects, and each agent's capacity can be filled now or later. Because the principal cares about capacity in the aggregate but each agent cares only about his own capacity, the agents assign a higher value to the option to wait. As a result, agents sometimes withhold ideas from the principal. We show that decentralization can be a solution to this problem. Delegating assignment rights to an agent reduces the option value of waiting for the other agent sufficiently that he is willing to reveal his ideas.

## 6. Misperceiving Interactions Among Complements and Substitutes: Organizational Consequences
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2002
### Abstract:
Systems composed of activity choices that interact in nonsimple ways can allow firms to create and sustain a competitive advantage. However, in complex systems, decision makers may not always have a precise understanding of the exact strength of the interaction between activities. Likewise, incentive and accounting systems may lead decision makers to ignore or misperceive interactions. This paper studies formally the consequences of misperceiving interaction effects between activity choices. Our results suggest that misperceptions with respect to complements are more costly than with respect to substitutes. As a result, firms should optimally invest more to gather information about interactions among complementary activities—e.g., concerning network effects—than about interactions among substitute activities. Similarly, the use of division-based incentive schemes appears to be more advisable for divisions whose products are substitutes than for divisions that produce complements. It is further shown that system fragility is not necessarily positively correlated with the strength ofthe interaction between choices. While systems of complements become increasingly fragile as the strength of interaction increases, systems of substitutes can become increasingly stable.

## 7. The Valuation of American Options for a Class of Diffusion Processes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2002
### Abstract:
We present an integral equation approach for the valuation of American-style derivatives when the underlying asset price follows a general diffusion process and the interest rate is stochastic. Our contribution is fourfold. First, we show that the exercise region is determined by a single exercise boundary under very general conditions on the interest rate and the dividend yield. Second, based on this result, we derive a recursive integral equation for the exercise boundary and provide a parametric representation of the American option price. Third, we apply the results to models with stochastic volatility or stochastic interest rate, and to American bond options in one-factor models. For the cases studied, explicit parametric valuation formulas are obtained. Finally, we extend results on American capped options to general diffusion prices. Numerical schemes based on approximations of the optimal stopping time (such as approximations based on a lower bound, or on a combination of lower and upper bounds) are shown to be valid in this context.

## 8. An Evaluation of Research on Integrated Product Development
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 2002
### Abstract:
Integrated Product Development (IPD) creates overlap and interaction between activities in the new product development process and, because this increases the need to coordinate, compensates through other aspects of the new product development process (e.g., integrated tools), product definitions (e.g., incremental development), organizational context (e.g., reduced task specialization), and teaming (e.g., cross-functional teams). Since IPD has become an important new standard for managing new product development, this paper's general aim is to evaluate the research that has been conducted on it. Our three specific objectives include first critiquing the IPD literature by identifying problems with empirical research and recommending solutions. There are concerns about the overall approach, conceptualizing and operationalizing IPD characteristics, and selecting performance objectives. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate relationships between specific IPD characteristics and project performance. We indicate where relationships do or do not exist and identify variables that may moderate these relationships. Third, we offer suggestions for extending IPD research into studies of (a) the hierarchy of teams working on a project, (b) one company managing a portfolio of projects over time, and (c) two or more firms collaborating in a strategic alliance.
