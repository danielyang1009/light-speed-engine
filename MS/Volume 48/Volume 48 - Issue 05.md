### Abstract:
Manufacturing systems typically contain processing and assembly stages whose output quality is significantly affected by the output quality of preceding stages in the system. This study offers and empirically validates a procedure for (1) measuring the effect of each stage's performance on the output quality of subsequent stages including the quality of the signal product, and (2) identifying stages in a manufacturing system where management should concentrate investments in process quality improvement. Our proposed procedure builds on the precedence ordering of the stages in the system and uses the information provided by correlations between the product quality measurements across stages.

## 2. Adaptive Inventory Control for Nonstationary Demand and Partial Information
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2002
### Abstract:
This paper examines several different policies for an inventory control problem in which the demand process is nonstationary and partially observed. The probability distribution for the demand in each period is determined by the state of a Markov chain, the core process. However, the state of this core process is not directly observed, only the actual demand is observed by the decision maker. Given this demand process, the inventory control problem is a composite-state, partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), which is an appropriate model for a number of dynamic demand problems. In practice, managers often use certainty equivalent control (CEC) policies to solve such a problem. However, this paper presents results that demonstrate that there are other practical control policies that almost always provide much better solutions for this problem than the CEC policies commonly used in practice. The computational results also indicate how specific problem characteristics influence the performance of each of the alternative policies.

## 3. A Dynamic Programming Procedure for Pricing American-Style Asian Options

### Published:

### Abstract:
Pricing European-style Asian options based on the arithmetic average, under the Black and Scholes model, involves estimating an integral (a mathematical expectation) for which no easily computable analytical solution is available. Pricing their American-style counterparts, which provide early exercise opportunities, poses the additional difficulty of solving a dynamic optimization problem to determine the optimal exercise strategy. A procedure for pricing American-style Asian options of the Bermudan flavor, based on dynamic programming combined with finite-element piecewise-polynomial approximation of the value function, is developed here. A convergence proof is provided. Numerical experiments illustrate the consistency and efficiency of the PROCEDURE. Theoretical properties of the value function and of the optimal exercise strategy are also established.

## 4. Information Flows in Capacitated Supply Chains with Fixed Ordering Costs
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Many organizations have only recently recognized that sharing information with other members in their supply chain can lead to signficant reduction in the total costs.Usually these information flows are incorporated into existing operating policies at the various parties.In this paper we argue that, in some cases, it may be necessary to change the way the supply chain is managed to make complete use of the information flows. We support this argument by analyzing a supply chain containing a capacitated supplier and a retailer facing i.i.d. demands. In addition there are fixed ordering costs between the retailer and the supplier.In this setting, we consider two models: (1) the retailer is using the optimal (s,S) policy and providing the supplier information about her inventory levels; and (2) the retailer, still sharing information on her inventory levels, orders in a period only if by the previous period the cumulative end-customer demand since she last ordered was greater than δ. Thus, in Model 1, information sharing is used to supplement existing policies; while, in Model 2, we have redefined operating policies to make better use of the information flows. We will show, via a detailed computational study, that the total supply chain costs of Model 2 are 10.4% lower, on the average, than that of Model 1. We noticed that this reduction in costs is higher at higher capacities, higher supplier penalty costs, lower retailer penalty costs, moderate values of set-up cost, and at lower end-customer demand variances.

## 5. Multistage Production to Order with Rework Capability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2002
### Abstract:
This study considers multistage production systems where defective units can be reworked repeatedly at every stage. Production, as well as rework, is in lots requiring set-up and variable production costs, and orders need to be filled in their entirety. The yield of each stage is uncertain, so several production runs may need to be attempted until the quantity of finished products is sufficient. The trade-off at each stage is between using small lots, possibly necessitating repeated rework set-ups and large lots, which may result in costly overproduction. Multistage manufacturing facilities with rework capabilities are quite common in practice, but their optimal operation when orders have to be met in full has been virtually unexplored. We show that a multistage system where only one of the stages requires a setup (a “single-bottleneck system”) can be reduced to a single-stage system. Moreover, if it is possible to arrange the operations in any order, we prove that it is best to make the “bottleneck” the first stage of the system. We also develop recursive algorithms for solving two- and three-stage systems, where all stages require set-ups, optimally. Generalizations to systems where rework yields and costs differ from those of initial processing are also discussed.

## 6. Bounding Option Prices by Semidefinite Programming: A Cutting Plane Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Jun-ya Gotoh

### Published:
- 1 May 2002
### Abstract:
In a recent article, Bertsimas and Popescu showed that a tight upper bound on a Europeantype call option price, given the first n moments of the distribution of the underlying security price, can be obtained by solving an associated semidefinite programming problem (SDP). The purpose of this paper is to improve and extend their results. We will show that a tight lower bound can be calculated by solving another SDP. Also, we will show that these problems can be solved very quickly by a newly developed cutting plane algorithm when n is less than six or seven.

## 7. Modeling and Analysis of Congestion in the Design of Facility Layouts
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Reducing manufacturing lead times and minimizing work-in-process (WIP) inventories are the cornerstones of popular manufacturing strategies such as Lean, Quick Response, and Just-in-Time Manufacturing. In this paper, we present a model that captures the relationshipbetween facility layout and congestion-related measures of performance. We use the model to introduce a formulation of the facility layout design problem where the objective is to minimize work-in-process (WIP). In contrast to some recent research, we show that layouts obtained using a WIP-based formul ation can be very different from those obtained using the conventional quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation. For example, we show that a QAP-optimal layout can be WIP-infeasible. Similarly, we show that two QAP-optimal layouts can have vastly different WIP values. In general, we show that WIP is not monotonic in material-handling travel distances. This leads to a number of surprising results. For instance, we show that it is possible to reduce overall distances between departments but increase WIP. Furthermore, we find that the relative desirability of a layout can be affected by changes in material-handling capacity even when travel distances remain the same. We examine the effect of various system parameters on the difference in WIP between QAP- and WIP-optimal layouts. We find that although there are conditions under which the difference in WIP is significant, there are those under which both layouts are WIP-equivalent.

## 8. Note: Ranking DMUs with Infeasible Super-Efficiency DEA Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2002
### Abstract:
It has been suggested in the data envelopment analysis (DEA) literature that it is impossible to obtain a full ranking of decision-making units (DMUs) when infeasible subproblems arise in the so-called super-efficiency DEA models under different returns to scale (RTS) assumptions other than constant returns to scale (CRS) andconsequently the application of the super-efficiency DEA models under different RTS conditions other than CRS should be restricted. The implications of the infeasibility in super-efficiency DEA models with respect to the efficiency ranking of the DMUs is explored. Based on the analysis, we show that it is still possible to obtain the full ranking of the entire observation set when infeasibilities arise in super-efficiency DEA models.
