### Abstract:
A large midwestern hospital is expecting an increase in surgical caseload. New operating room (OR) capacity can be had by building new ORs or extending the working hours in the current ORs. The choice among these options is complicated by the fact that patients, surgeons and surgical staff, and hospital administrators are all important stakeholders in the health service operation, and each has different priorities. This paper investigates the trade-offs among three performance criteria (wait to get on schedule, scheduled procedure start-time reliability, and hospital profits), which are of particular importance to the different constituencies. The objective is to determine how the hospital can best expand its capacity, acknowledging the key role that each constituency plays in that objective. En route, the paper presents supporting analysis for process improvements and suggestions for optimal participation-inducing staff contracts for extending OR hours of operation.

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2002
### Abstract:
We analyze a dynamic auction, in which a seller with C units to sell faces a sequence of buyers separated into T time periods. Each group of buyers has independent, private values for a single unit. Buyers compete directly against each other within a period, as in a traditional auction, and indirectly with buyers in other periods through the opportunity cost of capacity assessed by the seller. The number of buyers in each period, as well as the individual buyers' valuations, are random. The model is a variation of the traditional single leg, multiperiod revenue management problem, in which consumers act strategically and bid for units of a fixed capacity over time.

## 3. Coordinating Mechanisms in Care Provider Groups: Relational Coordination as a Mediator and Input Uncertainty as a Moderator of Performance Effects
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper proposes a model of how coordinating mechanisms work, and tests it in the context of patient care. Consistent with organization design theory, the performance effects of boundary spanners and team meetings were mediated by relational coordination, a communication- and relationship-intensive form of coordination. Contrary to organization design theory, however, the performance effects of routines were also mediated by relational coordination. Rather than serving as a replacement for interactions, as anticipated by organization design theory, routines work by enhancing interactions among participants. Likewise, all three coordinating mechanisms, including routines, were found to be increasingly effective under conditions of uncertainty.

## 4. Human Capital and Institutional Determinants of Information Technology Compensation: Modeling Multilevel and Cross-Level Interactions

### Abstract:
Compensation is critical in attracting and retaining information technology (IT) professionals. However, there has been very little research on IT compensation. Juxtaposing theories of compensation that focus on human capital endowments and labor market segmentation, we hypothesize multilevel and cross-level determinants of compensation. We use hierarchical linear modeling to analyze archival salary data for 1,576 IT professionals across 39 institutions. Results indicate that compensation is directly determined by human capital endowments of education and experience. Institutional differentials do not directly drive compensation, but instead moderate the relationship of human capital endowments to compensation. Large institutions pay more than small institutions to IT professionals with more education, while small institutions pay more than large institutions to IT professionals with less education. Not-for-profit institutions pay more than for-profits to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education. Further, information-intensive institutions pay more than non information-intensive institutions to IT professionals with more or IT-specific education. We interpret these results in the context of institutional rigidity, core competencies, and labor shortages in the IT labor market.

## 5. Effective Zero-Inventory-Ordering Policies for the Single-Warehouse Multiretailer Problem with Piecewise Linear Cost Structures

### Abstract:
We analyze the problem faced by companies that rely on TL (Truckload) and LTL (Less than Truckload) carriers for the distribution of products across their supply chain. Our goal is to design simple inventory policies and transportation strategies to satisfy time varying demands over a finite horizon, while minimizing system wide cost by taking advantage of quantity discounts in the transportation cost structures. For this purpose, we study the cost effectiveness of restricting the inventory policies to the class of zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) policies in a single-warehouse multiretailer scenario in which the warehouse serves as a cross-dock facility. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a ZIO inventory policy whose total inventory and transportation cost is no more than 4/3 (5.6/4.6 if transportation costs are stationary) times the optimal cost. However, finding the best ZIO policy is an NP hard problem as well. Thus, we propose two algorithms to find an effective ZIO policy: An exact algorithm whose running time is polynomial for any fixed number of retailers, and a linear-programming-based heuristic whose effectiveness is demonstrated in a series of computational experiments. Finally, we extend the worst-case results developed in this paper to systems in which the warehouse does hold inventory.

## 6. Return on Assets Loss from Situational and Contingency Misfits
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2002
### Abstract:
We develop a rule-based contingency misfit model and related hypotheses to test empirically the Burton and Obel (1998) multi contingency model for strategic organizational design. The model is a set of “if-then” misfit rules, in which misfits lead to a loss in performance; they are complements to the strategy and organizational contingency theory fit rules. Using data from 224 small- and medium-sized Danish firms, misfits are categorized and identified. Then, performance hypotheses are developed and tested using regression models. We confirm the hypotheses that firms with situational misfits or contingency misfits, or both, incur performance losses in return on assets compared with firms with no misfits. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find that additional misfits lead to increased performance loss. Our results suggest that just one misfit of any kind may significantly compromise performance. These results yield a deeper understanding of organizational contingency theory, as well as implications for the rule-based fit-misfit organizational design model.

## 7. Optimal Stock Allocation for a Capacitated Supply System

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2002
### Abstract:
We consider a capacitated supply system that produces a single item that is demanded by several classes of customers. Each customer class may have a different backorder cost, so stock allocation arises as a key decision problem. We model the supply system as a multi customer make-to-stock queue. Using dynamic programming, we show that the optimal allocation policy has a simple and intuitive structure. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm to compute the parameters of this optimal allocation policy. Finally, for a typical supply chain design problem, we illustrate that ignoring the stock allocation dimension—a frequently encountered simplifying assumption—can lead to incorrect managerial decisions.

## 8. Product Design with Multiple Quality-Type Attributes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 2002
### Abstract:
We consider a product line design problem with multiple attributes for a monopolist serving a market with two customer segments. Products are designed with quality type attributes for which more is always better than less. By considering multiple attributes, we derive a measure of multidimensional customer preference and offer insights into the optimal product design. When customers'preferences exhibit different orders in different attributes, our results show that products are differentiated horizontally where no one product is better than the other with respect to all attributes, and that there exists a region where the first-best solution for the monopolist is feasible despite the problem of cannibalization. Furthermore, single-product offering strategies are never optimal, so pooling of customer segments or reduction of the number of segments served will not occur.

## 9. Comment on “Generating Scenario Trees for Multistage Decision Problems”
### Author(s):
- Pieter Klaassen
### Published:
- 1 Nov 2002
### Abstract:
In models of decision making under uncertainty, one typically has to approximate the uncertainties by a limited number of discrete outcomes. Høyland and Wallace (2001) formulate a nonlinear programming problem to generate such a limited number of discrete outcomes while satisfying specified statistical properties. They have developed and employed this method for a stochastic multistage asset-allocation problem. When the method is applied to such financial optimization problems under uncertainty, we argue here that it does not suffice to match statistical properties. To obtain realistic outcomes, the (limited) description of the uncertainty in such models should also exclude arbitrage opportunities, and thereby be consistent with financial asset pricing theory. We illustrate that the method proposed by Høyland and Wallace can result in arbitrage opportunities in the scenario tree if only statistical properties are imposed. We show how one can check ex post for the presence of arbitrage opportunities in a scenario tree by checking for the existence of solutions to sets of linear equations. Arbitrage opportunities can also be precluded ex ante in the scenario tree by adding constraints to the nonlinear programming problem of Høyland and Wallace.
