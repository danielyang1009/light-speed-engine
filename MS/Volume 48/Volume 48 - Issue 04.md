### Abstract:
We examine, both theoretically and empirically, top-management compensation in the presence of agency conflicts when shareholders have delegated governance responsibilities to a self-interested Board of Directors (BOD). We develop a theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates the BOD as a strategic player, models the negotiation process between the CEO and the BOD in designing CEO compensation, and considers the impact of potential takeovers by large shareholders monitoring the CEO-BOD negotiations. In equilibrium, internal governance by the BOD and external takeover threats by a large shareholder act as substitutes in imposing managerial control, especially in constraining management's profligacy in awarding equity-based compensation to itself. The model emphasizes factors in the design of compensation contracts that are rarely considered in the literature, such as equity ownership of the largest outside shareholder and the firm's bankruptcy risk. It also provides new perspectives on factors that are often considered in the literature, such as firm size, firm performance, equity ownership of the BOD, and BOD structure. Our empirical tests lend considerable support for our theoretical predictions. Equity ownership of the largest external shareholder, that of the BOD, and the default risk, are strongly negatively related to the size of CEO equity compensation. Consistent with the theoretical model, these factors do not significantly influence the growth of fixed (or non-performance-related) compensation. We also find that the equity ownership of the BOD is more important in managerial compensation control than other BOD related variables, such as BOD size or the proportion of outside directors.

## 2. Predicting Equity Liquidity

### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a measure of liquidity, price impact, which quantifies the change in a firm's stock price associated with its observed net trading volume. For a large set of institutional trades we compare out-of-sample, characteristic-based estimates of price impact to actual price impacts. Predictive predetermined firm characteristics, chosen to proxy for the severity of adverse selection in the equity market, the non-information-based costs of making a market in the stock, and the extent of shareholder heterogeneity, include relative size, historical relative trading volume, institutional holdings, and the inverse of the stock price. We find numerous aspects of trade execution which are significantly related to the price impact forecast error in economically plausible ways: For example, the predicted price impact overestimates the actual price impact for very large trades, for trades executed in a more patient manner, and for trades where the institution pays higher commissions.

## 3. Controlling Information Systems Development Projects: The View from the Client

### Abstract:
Increasingly, business clients are actively leading information systems (IS) projects, often in collaboration with IS professionals, and they are exercising a greater degree of project control. Control is defined as all attempts to motivate individuals to achieve desired objectives, and it can be exercised via formal and informal modes. Much of the previous research investigating the choice of control mode has focused on direct reporting relationships between IS project leaders and their superiors in a hierarchical setting. However, the client-IS relationships may take on a variety of forms, including both hierarchical and lateral settings. Moreover, prior research has found that the knowledge of the systems development process is a key antecedent of control, yet clients are unlikely to be as knowledgeable as IS professionals about this process. It is therefore unclear whether prior findings will generalize to the client-IS pair, and the goal of this research is to examine the exercise of control across this relationship. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey of 69 pairs of clients and IS project leaders. The results are largely consistent with prior research on the antecedents of formal control modes, but they shed new insight on the choice of informal control modes.

## 4. Order-Based Backorders and Their Implications in Multi-Item Inventory Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2002
### Abstract:
In a multi-item inventory system, such as an assemble-to-order manufacturing system or an online-retailing system, a customer order typically consists of several different items in different amounts. The average order-based backorders are the average number of customer orders that are not yet completely filled. While this is an important measure of customer satisfaction, it has not been widely studied in the operations management literature. This is largely because its evaluation involves the joint distribution of inventory levels of different items and other intricate relations, which is computationally dreadful. Taking a novel approach, this paper develops a tractable way of evaluating this measure exactly. We also develop easy-to-compute bounds, which require the evaluation of item-based backorders only. Numerical experiments indicate that the average of the lower and upper bounds is very effective.

## 5. Quantifying Operational Synergies in a Merger/Acquisition
### Author(s):

- 1 Apr 2002
### Abstract:
Merger and acquisition activity has increased sharply in the last decade. It seems useful to have models that can help senior managers of bidder firms make informed decisions about the amount of premium, over the target's share prices prevailing prior to merger announcement, that can be justified on the basis of operational synergies. The goal of this article is to capture important parameters from the production side that have a bearing on the valuation of the target's shares. We show that the production characteristics of both the bidder and the target matter in a significant way. For example, if the bidder and target operate in independent markets, the bidder has flexible production facilities but the target's production facilities are inflexible, then an increase in the bidder's demand can make the target less attractive and lower the value of operational synergy.

## 6. Price Dispersion and Differentiation in Online Travel: An Empirical Investigation

### Abstract:
Previous research has examined whether price dispersion exists in theoretically highly efficient Internet markets. However, much of the previous work has been focused on industries with low cost and undifferentiated products. In this paper, we examine the presence of price dispersion and product differentiation using data on the airline ticket offerings of online travel agents (OTAs). We find that different OTAs offer tickets with substantially different prices and characteristics when given the same customer request. Some of this variation appears to be due to product differentiationâ€”different OTAs specialize by systematically offering different trade-offs between ticket price and ticket quality (minimizing the number of connections, matching requested departure and return time). However, even after accounting for differences in ticket quality, ticket prices vary by as much as 18% across OTAs. In addition, OTAs return tickets that are strictly inferior to the ticket offered by another OTA for the same request between 2.2% and 28% of the time. Overall, this suggests the presence of both price dispersion and product differentiation in the online travel market.

## 7. An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Multidimensional Knapsack Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2002
### Abstract:
We present an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach for the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). We approximate the value function (a) using parametric and nonparametric methods and (b)using a base-heuristic. We propose a new heuristic which adaptively rounds the solution of the linear programming relaxation. Our computational study suggests: (a)the new heuristic produces high quality solutions fast and robustly, (b)state of the art commercial packages like CPLEX require significantly larger computational time to achieve the same quality of solutions, (c) the ADP approach using the new heuristic competes successfully with alternative heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms, (d)the ADP approach based on parametric and nonparametric approximations, while producing reasonable solutions, is not competitive. Overall, this research illustrates that the base-heuristic approach is a promising computational approach for MKPs worthy of further investigation.

## 8. Adaptive Behavior of Impatient Customers in Tele-Queues: Theory and Empirical Support

### Abstract:
We address the modeling and analysis of abandonments from a queue that is invisible to its occupants. Such queues arise in remote service systems, notably the Internet and telephone call centers; hence, we refer to them as tele-queues. A basic premise of this paper is that customers adapt their patience (modeled by an abandonment-time distribution) to their service expectations, in particular to their anticipated waiting time. We present empirical support for that hypothesis, and propose an M/M/m-based model that incorporates adaptive customer behavior. In our model, customer patience depends on the mean waiting time in the queue. We characterize the resulting system equilibrium (namely, the operating point in steady state), and establish its existence and uniqueness when changes in customer patience are bounded by the corresponding changes in their anticipated waiting time. The feasibility of multiple system equilibria is illustrated when this condition is violated. Finally, a dynamic learning model is proposed where customer expectations regarding their waiting time are formed through accumulated experience. We demonstrate, via simulation, convergence to the theoretically anticipated equilibrium, while addressing certain issues related to censored-sampling that arise because of abandonments.

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2002
### Abstract:
Although many authors have noted the importance of minimizing workflow interference in facility layout design, traditional layout research tends to focus on minimizing the distance-based transportation cost. This paper formalizes the concept of workflow interference from a facility layout perspective. A model, formulated as a quartic assignment problem, is developed that explicitly considers the interference of workflow. Optimal and heuristic solution methodologies are developed and evaluated.
