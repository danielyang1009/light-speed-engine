### Abstract:
Selecting the right technologies to incorporate in new products is a particularly challenging aspect of new product definition and development. While newer advanced technologies may offer improved performance, they also make the product development process more risky and challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problem of technology selection and commitment under uncertainty, a major challenge to firms in turbulent environments. We argue that the "pizza-bin" approach of rejecting prospective technologies outright may not serve firms well when the pressure to differentiate products is enormous. After motivating the challenges and decisions facing firms using a real-life application from Dell Computer Corporation, we formulate a mathematical model of a firm that must define its products in the presence of technology uncertainty. Specifically, the firm faces two options: (i) a proven technology that is known to be viable and (ii) a prospective technology that offers superior price to performance results but whose viability is not a fully certain outcome. To minimize the impact of technology uncertainty, we consider two approaches to design flexibility, termed parallel path and sufficient design, which allow the firm to concurrently develop its products while the technology is being validated. Our analysis helps understand appropriateness of the different flexible design approaches. We illustrate our model with the Dell portable computer example and note the managerial implications of our analysis.

## 2. Optimal Control of a Paired-Kidney Exchange Program
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Organ exchanges are expected to increase the utilization of living donors and to alleviate the critical shortage of organs for transplantation. The typical arrangement involves a direct exchange between two blood-type incompatible donor-candidate pairs. An alternate possibility is an indirect exchange between one such pair and the highest priority candidate on the regular waiting list for cadaveric organs. This paper focuses on the mix of direct and indirect exchanges that maximizes the expected total discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of the candidates in the participating pairs. Direct exchanges are preferable because the candidate receives a living-donor organ instead of the inferior cadaveric organ an indirect exchange provides. However, the latter involves a shorter wait. To capture this tradeoff, we develop a double-ended queueing model for an exchange system with two types of donorcandidate pairs, and obtain an optimal dynamic exchange policy by invoking a Brownian approximation. The policy takes the form of a two-sided regulator in which new pairs will join the exchange system to wait for a direct exchange if and only if the process modeling the exchange system is within the regulator's two barriers. In all other circumstances, new pairs will participate in an indirect exchange. Expressions for the optimal barriers are obtained under a variety of assumptions about the objective function, including one of complete candidate autonomy. The analysis identifies three design principles that will amplify the likelihood of an exchange program's success. First, exchange programs must involve the coordinated activities of multiple local transplant centers to enjoy the substantial benefits of resource pooling. Second, participant wait must be controlled through indirect exchanges. Third, the program must respect participants' autonomy and weigh that autonomy against the broader goal of maximizing their overall welfare.

## 3. Structuring the New Product Development Pipeline
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
In many new product development (NPD) situations, the development process is characterized by uncertainty, and no single development approach will necessarily lead to a successful product. To increase the likelihood of having at least one successful product, multiple approaches may be simultaneously funded at the various NPD stages. The managerial challenge is to construct ex ante an appropriate NPD pipeline by choosing the right number of approaches to be funded at each stage. This so-called pipeline problem is also present in, among others, advertising copy selection and new products test markets problems. We describe here a normative model for structuring pipelines for such situations. The optimal structure of the pipeline is driven by the cost of the development approach, its probability of survival, and the expected profitability. We illustrate the workability and implications of the model by applying it to some real-world scenarios in the pharmaceutical industry, and by comparing its normative pipeline recommendations against actual pipelines. Our results suggest that, for the cases we studied, firms tend to use narrower pipelines for their new drug development than they should, and thereby they underspend on research and development. We also present general qualitative insights for one- and two-stage NPD optimal pipeline structures.

## 4. Network Ties, Reputation, and the Financing of New Ventures
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
Explaining how entrepreneurs overcome information asymmetry between themselves and potential investors to obtain financing is an important issue for entrepreneurship research. Our premise is that economic explanations for venture finance, which do not consider how social ties influence this process, are undersocialized and incomplete. However, we also argue that organization theoretic arguments, which draw on the concept of social obligation, are oversocialized. Drawing on the organizational theory literature, and in-depth fieldwork with 50 high-technology ventures, we examine the effects of direct and indirect ties between entrepreneurs and 202 seed-stage investors on venture finance decisions. We show that these ties influence the selection of ventures to fund through a process of information transfer.

## 5. Complementary Product Integration by High-Technology New Ventures: The Role of Initial Technology Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate the relationship between complementary product integration and the initial technology strategy of a high-technology new venture. With customers placing considerable emphasis on cross-product integration, the success of a new venture is dependent as much on its ability to integrate its product with relevant complementary products as on the core product functionality itself. We identify three types of complementary product integration: value-added internal, add-on module, and data interface. We argue that the adoption of proactive initial technology strategy critically determines the ability of a high-technology new venture to rapidly and efficiently integrate its product with new and emerging complementary products. More specifically, we offer hypotheses that relate initial design and development strategies to the number and the type of complementary product integrations achieved by a new venture in the initial years. The hypotheses are tested using data from a set of U.S.-based software new ventures. The results support our arguments and imply the need for high-technology new ventures to adopt an explicit complementary product focus during initial product design.

## 6. Simultaneous Capacity and Production Management of Short-Life-Cycle, Produce-to-Stock Goods Under Stochastic Demand
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
This paper derives the optimal simultaneous capacity and production plan for a shortlife-cycle, produce-to-stock good under stochastic demand. Capacity can be reduced as well as added, at exogenously set unit prices. In both cases studied, with and without carryover of unsold units, a target interval policy is optimal: There is a (usually different) target interval for each period such that capacity should be changed as little as possible to bring the level available into that interval. Our contribution in the case of no carry-over, is a detailed characterization of the target intervals, assuming demands increase stochastically at the beginning of the life cycle and decrease thereafter. In the case of carry-over, we establish the general result and show that capacity and inventory are economic substitutes: The target intervals decrease in the initial stock level and the optimal unconstrained base stock level decreases in the capacity level. In both cases, optimal service rates are not necessarily constant over time. A numerical example illustrates the results.

## 7. A Multi-Echelon Inventory System with Information Exchange
### Author(s):
- Kamran Moinzadeh
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we consider a supply-chain model consisting of a single product, one supplier, and multiple retailers. Demand at the retailers is random, but stationary. Each retailer places her orders to the supplier according to the well-known (Q,R) policy. We assume that the supplier has online information about the demand, as well as inventory activities of the product at each retailer, and uses this information when making order/replenishment decisions. We first propose a replenishment policy for the supplier, which incorporates information about the inventory position of the retailers. Then, we provide an exact analysis of the operating measures of such systems. Assuming the inventory/replenishment decisions are made centrally for the system, we compare the performance of our model with those that do not use information in their decision making, namely, systems that use installation stock policies via a numerical experiment. Based on our numerical results, we identify the parameter settings under which information sharing is most beneficial.

## 8. A Mean-Variance Analysis of Self-Financing Portfolios
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
This paper develops the analytics and geometry of the investment opportunity set (IOS) and the test statistics for self-financing portfolios. A self-financing portfolio is a set of long and short investments such that the sum of their investment weights, or net investment, is zero. This contrasts with a standard portfolio that has investment weights summing to one. Examples of self-financing portfolios are hedges, overlays, arbitrage portfolios, swaps, and long/short portfolios. A standard portfolio plus the IOS of self-financing portfolios form a restricted IOS hyperbola with restricted efficient set constants that differ from the usual constants. The restrictions affect statistical tests of portfolio efficiency, which are developed for the self-financing restrictions. As an application, we consider the self-financing portfolios formed by Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), based on market capitalization and value. In contrast to Fama and French (1992, 1993, 1995), we find that their restricted IOS is significantly different from the unrestricted IOS with the implication that the Fama-French tests are misspecified.

## 9. Generalized Column Generation for Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Osman Oğuz
### Published:
- 1 Mar 2002
### Abstract:
Column generation is a well-known and widely practiced technique for solving linear programs with too many variables or constraints to include in the initial formulation explicitly. Instead, the required column information is generated at each iteration of the simplex algorithm. This paper shows that, even if the number of variables is low enough for explicit inclusion in the model with the available technology, it may still be more efficient to resort to column generation for some class of problems.
