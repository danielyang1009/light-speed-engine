## 1. Incumbent Entry into New Market Niches: The Role of Experience and Managerial Choice in the Creation of Dynamic Capabilities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
Increasingly, technological innovation creates markets for new products and services. To survive, firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively.

## 2. Managing Demand and Sales Dynamics in New Product Diffusion Under Supply Constraint

### Abstract:
The Bass diffusion model is a well-known parametric approach to estimating new product demand trajectory over time. This paper generalizes the Bass model by allowing for a supply constraint. In the presence of a supply constraint, potential customers who are not able to obtain the new product join the waiting queue, generating backorders and potentially reversing their adoption decision, resulting in lost sales. Consequently, they do not generate the positive “word-of-mouth” that is typically assumed in the Bass model, leading to significant changes in the new product diffusion dynamics.

## 3. Customer Loyalty and Supplier Quality Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
We develop a model of customer choice in response to random variation in quality. The choice model yields closed-form expressions which reflect the effect of competing suppliers' service quality on the long-run fraction of purchases a customer makes at the various competitors. We then use the expressions as the basis of simple normative models for suppliers seeking to maximize their long-run average profits. The results provide insight into the effect of switching behavior on the service levels offered by competing suppliers.

## 4. A Dynamic IT Adoption Model for the SOHO Market: PC Generational Decisions with Technological Expectations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
The small-office/home-office (SOHO) professionals comprise the fastest growing segment in the labor force today. Typically being a one-person business based at home, SOHO owners mostly rely on office information technology to single handedly run their entire operation. Despite the segment's ostensibly growing dependence and influence on the information technology (IT) industry, still very little is known about the dynamics between SOHO and IT products. With the purpose of addressing this void, we investigate the SOHO professionals' adoption patterns of multigenerational IT products. Accordingly, we develop and empirically estimate an individual SOHO-level initial- and repeat-purchase logit model that captures the procurement patterns for successive generations of technological products, namely the PC category. Specifically, we find that SOHO professionals' procurement choices are influenced by a number of salient dimensions (i.e., income, performance, price, interpurchase time, network externalities). Furthermore, some SOHO owners are found to have a preference for a future (expected) generation (over a currently available one), which is explained via their business dispositions (i.e., technology orientation, result orientation, search orientation) toward accepting technological incertitude.

## 5. Make to Order or Make to Stock: Model and Application
### Author(s):
- S. Rajagopalan
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
Some firms make all their products to order while others make them to stock. There are a number of firms that maintain a middle ground, where some items are made to stock and others are made to order. This paper was motivated by a consumer product company faced with the decision about which items to make to stock and which ones to make to order, and the inventory and production policy for the make-to-stock items. The production environment is characterized by multiple items, setup times between the production of consecutive items, limited capacity, and congestion effects. In such an environment, making an item to order reduces inventory costs for that item, but might increase the lot size and inventory costs for the items made to stock. Also, lead times increase because of congestion effects, resulting in higher safety stocks for make-to-stock items and lower service levels for make-to-order items, thus leading to a complex trade-off. We develop a nonlinear, integer programming formulation of the problem. We present an efficient heuristic to solve the problem, which was motivated by key results for a special case of the problem without congestion effects that can be solved optimally. We also develop a lower bound to evaluate the performance of the heuristic. A computational study indicates that the heuristic performs well. We discuss the application of the model in a large firm and the resulting insights. We also provide insights into the impact of various problem parameters on the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decisions using a computational study. In particular, we find that the average number of setups of an item selected for make-to-stock production is always less than half the average number of setups of the item if it were to be made to order. Also, factors other than an item's demand, such as its setup time, processing time, and unit holding cost, impact the make-to-order versus make-to-stock decision.

## 6. Investment, Capital Structure, and Complementarities Between Debt and New Equity
### Author(s):
- Rune Stenbacka

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
We study simultaneous investment and financing decisions made by incumbent owners in the presence of capital market imperfections. We present a theory for how the optimal combination of debt and equity financing depends on the firm's internal funds. We identify complementarities between the two financial instruments. We test these predictions empirically with panel data on 3,119 corporations in the COMPUSTAT database. Our estimates using instrumental variable techniques support our theoretical predictions regarding the link between internal funds and capital investments, as well as the interaction effects between debt and new equity. We explore implications for managers, financiers, and policy makers.

## 7. Managing Capacity and Inventory Jointly in Manufacturing Systems
### Author(s):
- James R. Bradley
- Peter W. Glynn
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop approximations that yield insight into the joint optimization of capacity and inventory,and how the optimal inventory policy varies with capacity investment in a single-product, single-station, make-to-stock manufacturing system in which inventory is managed through a base-stock policy. We allow for a correlated demand stream as we analyze our models in an asymptotic regime,in which the penalty and holding costs are small relative to the cost of capacity. Although our approximations are asymptotically correct,our Brownian approximation is accurate even under moderate traffic intensity.

## 8. Exploring the Locus of Profitable Pollution Reduction
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we explore the locus of profitable pollution reduction. We propose that managers underestimate the full value of some means of pollution reduction and so under exploit these means. Based on evidence from previous studies, we argue that waste prevention often provides unexpected innovation offsets, and that onsite waste treatment often provides unexpected cost. We use statistical methods to test the direction and significance of the relationship between the various means of pollution reduction and profitability. We find strong evidence that waste prevention leads to financial gain, but we find no evidence that firms profit from reducing pollution by other means. Indeed, we find evidence that the bene fits of waste prevention alone are responsible for the observed association between lower emissions and profitability.

## 9. The Inventory Benefit of Shipment Coordination and Stock Rebalancing in a Supply Chain
### Author(s):
- Ki Ling Cheung

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
In this paper, we examine two information-based supply-chain efforts that are often linked to Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) programs. Specifically, we consider a supplier serving multiple retailers located in a close proximity. The first effort uses information on the retailers' inventory positions to coordinate shipments from the supplier to enjoy economies of scale in shipments, such as full truckloads.The second effort uses the same information for eventual unloading of the shipments to the retailers to rebalance their stocking positions. How much benefit do we gain from such initiatives? What are the relative benefits of the two initiatives? What are the drivers of such benefits? This paper seeks answers to these questions.

## 10. Aggregate Social Discount Rate Derived from Individual Discount Rates
### Author(s):
- Kenneth F. Reinschmidt
### Published:
- 1 Feb 2002
### Abstract:
In the economic evaluation of large public-sector projects, an aggregate social discount rate may be used in present worth comparison of alternatives. This paper uses the assumptions that individual discount rates are constant over time and approximately Normally distributed across the affected population, with mean μ and variance σ2, to derive an aggregate discount function that is exponential in form but with time-dependent aggregate discount rate ρ(t) = μ − σ2t/2, where t is the time of occurrence of the cost or benefit. This equation agrees with numerical simulations. If σ2 > 0, then the aggregate discount rate is less than the mean individual discount rate, and use of the time-dependent aggregate discount rate ρ(t) = μ − σ2t/2 instead of the constant discount factor ρ(t) = μ would result in larger discounted present values for public-sector projects for which the benefits lie far in the future. This could mean that public-sector investments that would be rejected under the assumption ρ(t) = μ might be justified using the time-dependent aggregate discount rate ρ(t) = μ − σ2t/2.
