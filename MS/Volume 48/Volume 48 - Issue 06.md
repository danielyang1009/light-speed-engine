### Abstract:
Economic forces shape the behavior of individuals and institutions. Forces affecting individual behavior are attitudes about payoffs (gains and losses) and beliefs about outcomes (risk and ambiguity). Under risk, the likelihoods of alternative outcomes are fully known. Under ambiguity, these likelihoods are unknown. In our experiment, payoffs and outcomes were manipulated independently during a classical choice task as brain activity was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we show that attitudes about payoffs and beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes exhibit interaction effects both behaviorally and neurally. Participants are risk averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses; they are ambiguity-seeking in neither gains nor losses. Two neural substrates for choice surfaced in the interaction between attitudes and beliefs: a dorsomedial neocortical system and a ventromedial system. This finding reveals that the brain does not honor a prevalent assumption of economics—the independence of the evaluations of payoffs and outcomes. The demonstration of a relationship between brain activity and observed economic choice attests to the feasibility of a neuroeconomic decision science.

### Abstract:
This paper investigates the impacts of a secondary market where resellers can buy and sell excess inventories. We develop a two-period model with a single manufacturer and many resellers. At the beginning of the first period resellers order and receive products from the manufacturer, but at the beginning of the second period, they can trade inventories among themselves in the secondary market. We endogenously derive the optimal decisions for the resellers, along with the equilibrium market price of the secondary market. The secondary market creates two interdependent effect—a quantity effect (sales by the manufacturer) and an allocation effect (supply chain performance). The former is indeterminate; i.e., the total sales volume for the manufacturer may increase or decrease, depending on the critical fractile. The latter is always positive; i.e., the secondary market always improves allocative efficiency. The sum of the effects is also unclear—the welfare of the supply chain may or may not increase as a result of the secondary market. Lastly, we study potential strategies for the manufacturer to increase sales in the presence of the secondary market.

## 3. Do Better Customers Utilize Electronic Distribution Channels? The Case of PC Banking

### Abstract:
Many service firms are pursuing electronic distribution strategies to augment existing physical infrastructure for product and service delivery. But little systematic study has been made for whether and how characteristics or behaviors might differ between customers who use electronic delivery systems and those who use traditional channels. We explore these differences by comparing customers who utilize personal-computer-based home banking (PC banking) to other bank customers. Case studies and detailed customer data from four institutions suggest that PC banking customers are apparently more profitable, principally due to unobservable characteristics extant before the adoption of PC banking. Demographic characteristics and changes in customer behavior following adoption of PC banking account for only a small fraction of overall differences. It also appears that retention is marginally higher for customers of the online channel.

## 4. Privacy Protection of Binary Confidential Data Against Deterministic, Stochastic, and Insider Threat

### Abstract:
A practical model and an associated method are developed for providing consistent, deterministically correct responses to ad-hoc queries to a database containing a field of binary confidential data. COUNT queries, i.e., the number of selected subjects whose confidential datum is positive, are to be answered. Exact answers may allow users to determine an individual's confidential information. Instead, the proposed technique gives responses in the form of a number plus a guarantee so that the user can determine an interval that is sure to contain the exact answer. At the same time, the method is also able to provide both deterministic and stochastic protection of the confidential data to the subjects of the database. Insider threat is defined precisely and a simple option for defense against it is given. Computational results on a simulated database are very encouraging in that most queries are answered with tight intervals, and that the quality of the responses improves with the number of subjects identified by the query. Thus the results are very appropriate for the very large databases prevalent in business and governmental organizations. The technique is very efficient in terms of both time and storage requirements, and is readily scalable and implementable.

## 5. Breaking Through the Clutter: Benefits of Advertisement Originality and Familiarity for Brand Attention and Memory
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Rising levels of advertising competition have made it increasingly difficult to attract and hold consumers' attention and to establish strong memory traces for the advertised brand. A common communication strategy to break through this competitive clutter is to increase ad originality. However, ad originality may have detrimental effects when consumers pay more attention to the ad at the expense of the advertised brand. Moreover, the positive effects of originality may quickly wane when the ad becomes familiar. Surprisingly, no research to date has examined such brand attention and memory effects of ad originality and familiarity. The current study aims to fill this void. We use a stochastic model of the influence that ad originality and familiarity have on consumers' eye fixations to the key elements of advertisements—brand, text, and pictorial—and how the information extracted during eye fixations promotes memory for the advertised brand. The model explicitly accounts for heterogeneity due to consumers and advertisements. Infrared eye tracking was applied to collect eye fixation data from 119 consumers who paged through two general-audience magazines containing 58 full-page advertisements. Memory for the advertised brands was assessed with an indirect memory task. The model was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In support of our hypotheses, original advertisements drew more attention to the advertised brand. More importantly however, advertisements that were both original and familiar attracted the largest amount of attention to the advertised brand, which improved subsequent brand memory. In addition, original and familiar ads were found to promote brand memory directly. Implications of these findings for communication and media planning strategy are discussed.

## 6. CEO Characteristics and Firm R&D Spending

### Abstract:
Over the past fifteen years, a number of studies have examined the determinants of firm R&D spending. These studies, however, almost invariably focus on the role of firm or external ownership characteristics in predicting R&D spending while overlooking the attributes of the top managers involved in allocating corporate resources. In this study, we change that focus by empirically examining how R&D spending as compared to industry competitors varies at firms based on the characteristics of their CEOs. Using a sample of publicly traded firms, we find that CEO characteristics explain a significant proportion of the sample variance in firm R&D spending even when corporate strategy, ownership structure, and other firm-level attributes are controlled. In terms of individual CEO characteristics, we find that R&D spending is greater at firms where CEOs are younger, have greater wealth invested in firm stock and signifacant career experience in marketing and/or engineering/R&D. In contrast to existing theory, we find that the amount of a CEO's formal education had no significant association with R&D spending once a CEO has attained a college degree. However, significant R&D spending increases are found at firms where CEOs have advanced science-related degrees. From subgroup analyses, we further find that CEO effects on relative R&D spending increase with longer CEO tenure implying that CEOs, over time, may mold R&D spending to suit their own preferences. From these results, we make implications for both research on determinants of R&D spending and managerial practice.

## 7. A Context-Dependent Model of the Gambling Effect
### Author(s):
- Han Bleichrodt

### Published:
- 1 Jun 2002
### Abstract:
This paper presents a context-dependent theory of decision under risk. The relevant contextual factor is the presence of a riskless lottery in a preference comparison. The theory only deviates from expected utility if the set of options contains both riskless and risky lotteries. The main motivation for the theory is to explain the gambling effect. Contrary to previous theories of the gambling effect, the present theory is consistent with stochastic dominance. It can, however, violate transitivity. The theory allows for a decomposition of the interaction between risk aversion and gambling aversion and thereby extends the classical Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion.

## 8. Strategic Equilibrium for a Pair of Competing Servers with Convex Cost and Balking

### Abstract:
A two-person game is formulated for a queuing situation involving a pair of exponential servers competing for arriving customers. The servers have identical characteristics except for their service rates. Each server is free to select its own service rate. The objective of each server is to select a service rate that will maximize its own profit. Arrivals are Poisson. The probability that an arriving customer enters the queue is allowed to depend on the queue length at the time of arrival. The proportion of arrivals to a given server is shown to be strictly concave in the server's own service rate and decreasing in the other service rate. Furthermore, we show that when the cost function is convex and increasing, there exists a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium point for the resulting game.
