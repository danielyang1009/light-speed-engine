## 2. On Some Works of Kantorovich, Koopmans and Others
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- W. W. Cooper
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
The July, I960, issue of Management Science contains an English translation of an important original article by L. V. Kantorovich [Kantorovich, L. V. Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production. Leningrad University, 1939, with a Foreword by A. R. Marchenko (Russian). An English translation, prepared by R. W. Campbell and W. H. Marlow, appears under this same title in Management Science Vol. 6, No. 4, (July, 1960), pp. 366–422.] and an introductory note by T. C. Koopmans [Koopmans, T. C. 1960. A note about Kantorovich's paper, ‘Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production'. Management Sci.6 (4, July) 363–365.] which is both evaluative and explanatory. In his penultimate paragraph, Professor Koopmans accords a tribute to this writing of Kantorovich which is at least partly deserved, although it is also paid for, we think, at too high a price in modesty for Professor Koopman's own work as well as the work of others. There is a certain lack of precision at critical points in the Kantorovich article which may tend to compound this price if allowed to stand through time. Professor Koopmans does not take adequate account of this lack of precision—e.g., in his discussion of the computing methods—perhaps because he restricted himself to a very short preface. Also, he runs together various major ideas (resolving multipliers, duality and efficiency prices) which need to be separated for more careful examination. Finally, the discussion is so cryptic as to raise some questions as to what Koopmans had in mind in his closing references wherein he compares Kantorovich's accomplishments (in the instant article) to those of von Neumann, Dantzig, et al.

## 4. A Problem in Equipment Maintenance
### Author(s):
- George H. Weiss
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
There have been several publications dealing with the theory of semi-Markov processes, [1–6]. Most of these have been purely theoretical analyses, although it is realized that the theory has many potential applications, [4, 6], particularly to so-called “repairman” problems and to problems in reliability. Other work along these lines has recently appeared in the literature, [8–11]. These papers are concerned with the reliability of multi-state mechanisms [8], with surveillance plans, [9, 10] and with inventory problems. In particular, the work of Barlow and Proschan considers a model almost identical to our own, using renewal theory methods. Since the semi-Markov process can be considered to be a generalization of renewal theory, it is not surprising that such applications are the first to suggest themselves. It is the purpose of this paper to present an application of the theory of semi-Markov processes to a problem in maintenance theory and obtain results which we believe to be new. The body of this paper will consist of material relevant to the actual problem; a development of the theory as needed in our presentation will be found in the Appendix.

## 5. A Queueing Model for Business Students
### Author(s):
- John S. De Cani
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop an N-server queueing model which overcomes some of the objections usually raised by business students when they are confronted with the discussion of queues in standard management science texts. The model permits a solution in terms of expected profit maximization rather than in terms of expected cost minimization. That is, the optimum number of servers can be determined by equating marginal cost to marginal revenue. The model has the property that the longer the waiting line the less likely it is that a new arrival will join the queue. Because of this property, the model could be called a “balking” model in the sense of Haight, (Haight, Frank A. 1957. Queueing with Balking. Biometrika44 (3) and 4 (3) 60–369 (December); Haight, Frank A. 1960. Queueing with Balking, II. Biometrika47 (3) and 4 285–296 (December).); would-be arrivals balk at long waiting lines. This balking has the effect of bounding the expected length of the queue so long as there are one or more servers in attendance. Finally, with this model it is possible to derive an implicit relationship between the average expenditure per customer and the value of customer waiting time.

## 6. Estimation of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts by Markov Chains
### Author(s):
- R. M. Cyert
- H. J. Davidson
- G. L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
Investigation of more accurate and efficient methods of estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts was begun in the early 1950's by R. M. Cyert and R. M. Trueblood [Cyert, R. M., R. M. Trueblood. 1957. Statistical sampling techniques in the aging of accounts receivable in a department store. Management Sci.3 (2, January) 185–195.]. At this time, studies were confined primarily to investigation of more efficient methods of performing the first step in the estimation procedure: determining the age distribution of accounts. In particular, the applicability of statistical sampling techniques was evaluated. A number of retail establishments now use scientific sampling methods to perform the first step in the estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

## 7. A General Model for Investment Policy
### Author(s):
- Arnold Reisman
- Elwood S. Buffa
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
This article presents a mathematical model describing the most general case in equipment investment policy. A systematic study of all other cases in the order of decreasing complexity follows. The general model reduces to their present worth all disbursements and receipts involved in the possession and operation of a succession of equipment having varying initial costs, life spans, salvage values, income and cost functions. With one recent exception (1), it is a more general model than those seen by the authors. All possible special cases of the general model are presented in a systematic fashion. Finally, previous models and working decision rules are fit into the framework of this model as special cases.

## 9. Incentives, Decentralized Control, the Assignment of Joint Costs and Internal Pricing
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
A goal of good management should be to design a reward system for those who take risks in making decisions in such a manner that the rewards to the individual correlate positively with the worth of the decision to the organization (taking into account the attitude of the top management to variance as well as to expected gain). In many organizations cost accounting supplies much of the information used for control at several levels. In this paper we examine some of the control problems that arise if joint costs are assigned by various cost accounting and some internal pricing conventions.

## 10. Simultaneous Processing of Jobs on an Electronic Computer
### Author(s):
- James L. McKenney
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the control implications of simultaneously processing several different programs on an electronic computer. This paper reports on the advantages of prescribing computer programs such that they have no arbitrary sequence constraints and can be segmented into independent subjobs which can be processed by one component of a computer, for example, an input device. Combining several programs writtern in this fashion would create a macro-program composed of a hierarchy of subjobs. Such a prescription method would allow a properly constituted automatic dispatching component to recursively subdivide this macro-program into subjobs that are performable by an independent component of the computer. The purpose of creating programs so they can automatically be combined and segmented is to provide a queue of work for each available operating component of a computer. This study attempts to demonstrate the advantage of this approach as a method of obtaining more capacity with developed equipments. The results give some evidence for a change in programming methods and a need to devote more resources to improving control procedures to allow simultaneous processing of many jobs.

## 12. Judgment and Decision-Making Activities of Government Executives as Described by Superiors and Co-Workers
### Author(s):
- Garlie A. Forehand
- Harold Guetzkow
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1962
### Abstract:
Concepts which may be useful in research on executive performance stem from a variety of sources and are expressed in a variety of vocabularies. Administrators themselves have developed a complex jargon which is likely to be as mystifying to the social scientists as is the latter's to them. Administrative theorists often formulate variables in the language of psychology [10] in order to pose problems and suggest hypotheses for study. The translation of ideas from practitioner's lore or administrative theory into behavioral terms amenable to measurement, however, raises a host of conceptual and methodological questions.
