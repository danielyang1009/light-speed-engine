## 1. How Rational Should a Manager be?
### Author(s):
- I. J. Good
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
It is often rightly stressed that research workers should learn how to sell their work to managers, by avoiding technical jargon, and by otherwise acquiring skill in exposition. But managers often take a step towards the research men by learning a little science. I wish to advocate that managers should learn to use a little of the language of the theory of rationality, to make judgments of inequalities between probabilities and between utilities, and to understand what it means to be reasonably consistent. In my opinion the consequences would be a great increase in the value of operational research.

## 2. The Use of Linear Programming and Mathematical Models in Under-Ground Oil Production
### Author(s):
- J. S. Aronofsky
- A. C. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
This paper describes how linear programming models can be used to solve crude-oil producing problems for the purpose of economic planning of coordinated operations. Although the methods of linear programming have been used extensively in the oil industry, very little work has been reported to date in extending these methods to the area of underground oil production. Two separate models are presented. The first model schedules production and assumes either a completely developed field, or, in the case of only partially developed fields, it assumes a given drilling schedule. The second model schedules drilling-rig operations when it is assumed that the production from a given well follows a specified production-decline curve. Consideration also is given to a means for optimizing the investors rate of return which appears as a nonlinear parameter in the objective function.

## 3. Education—Rich Problems and Poor Markets
### Author(s):
- William J. Platt
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
Decision-makers and policy-makers in education face some options to which systems analysts and economists might make contributions. Some of these options are identified within three clusters: how much to invest in education, how to allocate that investment, and what technology and organization to use. Tuition and fees, scholarships, admissions and retention requirements, and counseling policies are viewed as policy settings that can more explicitly encourage educational flows appropriate to development objectives. Education is shown to be a dispersed and difficult “market” for research services.

## 4. On Trivial and Binding Constraints in Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- J. C. G. Boot
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
The present paper is concerned with the constraints which enter in programming problems in the form of linear inequalities. The solution of a programming problem consists of finding that point out of the points satisfying all constraints which maximizes some given objective function. Constraints may be trivial in the sense that, should we delete them, the set of points satisfying all (remaining) constraints does not increase. This notion is discussed in detail in Sections 1–5. Section 6, using the concept of a trivial constraint, proves concisely the main theorems of linear programming, known as the duality theorem and the existence theorem. Part 2 discusses binding constraints, i.e., constraints which are satisfied in equational form in the solution. The approach is based on the work of Theil-Van de Panne [Theil, H., C. van de Panne. 1960. Quadratic programming as an extension of conventional quadratic maximization. Management Sci.7 (1) 1–20], which amounts to finding the set S of constraints such that, maximizing the objective function with all constraints belonging to S taken as strict equalities, the solution point is obtained. Rules are given in the work of Theil-Van de Panne to generate this set. One conclusion is that the set thus generated need not be unique in cases of “pathological” degeneracy. Another that trivial constraints may be binding! Numerical examples and figures illustrate the various anomalies.

## 5. A Method of Solution for Quadratic Programs
### Author(s):
- C. E. Lemke
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
This paper describes a method of minimizing a strictly convex quadratic functional of several variables constrained by a system of linear inequalities. The method takes advantage of strict convexity by first computing the absolute minimum of the functional. In the event that the values of the variables yielding the absolute minimum do not satisfy the constraints, an equivalent and simplified quadratic problem in the “Lagrange multipliers” is derived. An efficient algorithm is devised for the transformed problem, which leads to the solution in a finite number of applications. A numerical example illustrates the method.

## 6. Generalizations of the Optimal Final Inventory Model
### Author(s):
- G. Hadley
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
The purpose of this note is to generalize the optimal final inventory model presented previously [Hadley, G., T. M. Whitin. 1961. An optimal final inventory model. Management Sci.7(2) 179–183]. Two generalizations are made. First, the mean demand is allowed to vary with time so that dynamic situations may be studied. Secondly, the date of obsolescence is no longer required to be fixed but is instead allowed to be described by a probability distribution.

## 7. A Family of Dynamic Inventory Models
### Author(s):
- G. Hadley
- T. M. Whitin
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
A family of inventory models in which demand is allowed to change with time is studied. One general model is presented which includes every member of the “family” as a special case. The general model assumes that demand is a random variable. The mean rate of demand may vary over time but demands in different time periods are assumed independent. It is assumed that there is a date of obsolescence for the item with no demands occurring after this date. The time of obsolescence may be either known or alternatively a finite number of obsolescence dates and their probable occurrence may be specified.

## 8. Constrained Inventory Rules for Production Smoothing
### Author(s):
- Peter R. Winters
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
Production smoothing (or production planning) methods are used to decide on aggregate production levels for a factory, without specifying what individual products should be produced, or when, or how much. Inventory control of finished goods inventory makes these latter decisions, but does so for each product, independently, without regard for the aggregate effect on the factory. This paper discusses several (unsatisfactory) attempts to make these two sets of decisions consistent, and then presents several ways of making trigger and lot-size inventory decisions (production decisions for individual products) that aim at minimizing total inventory costs while yielding a desired level of aggregate factory production.

## 9. Computation for the Redistribution Model with Set-Up Charge
### Author(s):
- S. G. Allen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
A systematic computation procedure is given for determining redistribution of stock among several user activities when set-up charges are involved. The procedure is divided into two phases, the first of which determines whether any redistributions should be made at all. Then the second phase determines the total amount to be shipped or received at each activity.

## 10. Optimum Bond Portfolio Selections
### Author(s):
- Pao Lun Cheng
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with adapting Dr. Harry M. Markowitz's work on optimum portfolio selection of equity issues to portfolio selection of debt issues for achieving optimum maturity distribution. In establishing the optimum, investor's “tactics” take place of individual securities in Markowitz's analysis. An investor can choose from sets of efficient tactics either to minimize the variance of portfolio return or to maximize expected portfolio return.

## 11. A Generalized Model for Analyzing Management Information Systems
### Author(s):
- Eugene D. Homer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
This paper points out that, in spite of the potential power of the Lieberman model for integrated business systems, (Lieberman, I. J. 1956. A mathematical model for integrated business systems. Management Sci.2(4) 327–336) its application to practical cases is hampered by the fact that most systems can be described only in a series of matrices which are not compatible for multiplication. Two methods of finding the “product” in such cases are described. The second method offers the advantages that only one matrix need be constructed to describe the entire system, that only elementary column operations are required to yield a solution, that the ordering of the system components need not be considered, and that components which are system inputs, system outputs, and those which are outside the scope of the study are immediately identified. A proof of the mathematical validity of the second method is given.

## 12. A Model for Industrial Learning Costs
### Author(s):
- Maurice Kilbridge
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1962
### Abstract:
This paper presents a framework for the analysis of operator learning cost with special reference to assembly groups. Learning has the limited meaning of skill acquisition as measured by increased productivity. Learning cost is formulated as a function of the length of task to be learned, other variables being fixed. Three components of learning cost are distinguished and analyzed separately. The total learning cost model is the sum of the three component models.
