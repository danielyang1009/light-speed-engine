## 1. Management Science and Research in Great Britain
### Author(s):
- Leslie T. Wilkins
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
This paper is divided into three parts. In the first part, the present stage of development of management science in the United Kingdom is briefly discussed; in the second part are given a few “case histories,” stressing the methodology; the third part discusses a few recent features of management science in the United Kingdom which seem to be interesting.

## 2. On an Industrial Programming Problem of Kantorovich
### Author(s):
- J. R. Isbell
- W. H. Marlow
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
This paper is a presentation of a maximization problem treated by L. V. Kantorovich [Kantorovich, L. V. 1957. On methods of analysis of some extremal problems in planning production. Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR115 441–444. (Russian) In translation: Rand Corporation T-86 dated 15 April 1958]. The problem concerns a linear model for industrial production, but the objective is to maximize a non-linear function of the output. Specifically, a certain composition or package of final products is ordered, and the size of this output of predetermined composition is to be as large as possible.

## 3. Queues with Dynamic Priority Discipline
### Author(s):
- James R. Jackson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
A report on the writer's computer simulation studies of queues in which service order is governed by due-date-like priorities. The main results are in the form of conjectures about the upper tails of the waiting-time distributions. Pertinent mathematical research is mentioned.

## 4. An Inventory Model for Arbitrary Interval and Quantity Distributions of Demand
### Author(s):
- Martin Beckmann
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
The inventory problem for continuous time is studied under the following assumptions about the demand process (1) an arbitrary distribution of the length of intervals between successive demands; (2) a distribution of the quantity demanded which is independent of the last quantity demanded and any previous events but may depend on the time elapsed since the last demand; (3) unfilled orders are backlogged. The delivery time is fixed. Costs considered are fixed ordering costs and proportional costs of purchase, storage and shortage. The loss function and the equations for reordering point and minimal ordering quantity are derived. Formulae are calculated for the Poisson, stuttering Poisson, geometric, negative binomial, Gamma and compounded distributions.

## 5. Inventory Valuations—An Analytic Technique
### Author(s):
- Harlan D. Mills
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
Recursive inventory decision processes, when formulated as dynamic programs, lead to functional equations. The unknown functions in these equations have arguments which range over the set of possible inventory conditions in the process, and values which represent the minimum possible expected present value of the costs of operating the process through the indefinite future. We call these functions “inventory valuations.”

## 6. The Balance Delay Problem
### Author(s):
- M. Kilbridge
- L. Wester
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
Balance delay time is the amount of idle time on production assembly lines caused by the uneven division of work among operators or stations. It is related to the extent and way the total task is subdivided. In this paper the problem of balance delay is treated empirically and analytically. Empirical studies show that high balance delay is associated with a wide range of work-element times and a high degree of line mechanization. The analytical study yields a general algebraic method of minimizing balance delay by the appropriate choice of cycle times. Balance delay functions are drawn and the condition of perfect balance is shown to coincide with the zero points of these functions.

## 7. Notes on Quadratic Programming: The Kuhn-Tucker and Theil-Van De Panne Conditions, Degeneracy, and Equality Constraints
### Author(s):
- J. C. G. Boot
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
The purpose of this note is to prove that the rules on which Theil and van de Panne [Theil, H., C. van de Panne. 1960. Quadratic programming as an extension of conventional quadratic maximization. Management Sci.7(1) 1–20] based their recent method to follow straightforward from the well-known Kuhn-Tucker conditions and to propose a method for handling degeneracy in quadratic programming.

## 8. A Redistribution Model with Set-Up Charge
### Author(s):
- S. G. Allen
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1961
### Abstract:
This paper considers the problem of redistributing stock among several user activities within the period between regular deliveries of new supplies to the system. The cost of redistribution is assumed to be proportional to the number of shipments among the activities. A procedure based on minimizing total redistribution and shortage costs within the period is given for determining the amounts (if any) to be shipped among activities.
