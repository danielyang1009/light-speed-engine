## 1. Concepts in Operational Support Research

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
Based upon actual studies on current complex military systems, an attempt is made to gather into a cohesive form those concepts characterizing the operational support field (defined as the process having the objective of keeping system availability at acceptable levels). The concepts have evolved from integrated studies on reliability, maintainability and logistics problems and have proven to be productive in the solution of varied types of support problems.

## 2. Stochastic Scheduling by the Horizon Method
### Author(s):
- G. H. Symonds
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
The stochastic scheduling problem discussed in this paper is similar to the classical inventory model. It is concerned with the demand for a single commodity expressed as a set of independent stochastic variables with known distributions and an objective functional composed of production and inventory cost variables. The model, however, incorporates a uniquely determined planning horizon, and in the usual application requires only a finite number of time periods. The horizon period is based upon the minimum expected loss in the operation and therefore is subject to the stochastic variables of demand.

## 3. An Algorithm for the Construction and Evaluation of Feasible Schedules
### Author(s):
- Jack Heller
- George Logemann
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
An algorithm for the generation of feasible schedules and the computation of the completion times of the job operations of feasible schedule is presented. Using this algorithm, the distribution of schedule times over the set of feasible schedule—or a subset of feasible schedules—was determined for technological orderings that could occur in a general machine shop. These distributions are found to be approximately normal. Biasing techniques corresponding to “first come first serve,” random choice of jobs ready at each machine and combinations of these two extremes were used to compute distributions of schedule times.

## 4. A Model of Multi-Period Investment under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Bertil Naslund
- Andrew Whinston
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
This paper explores rational decision making for investment in the stock market. The first part is concerned with problems of a methodological nature, mainly dealing with the relationship between normative models and operations research. The major part explores a particular model and the various features the model possesses. The interpretation and use of a dual prices in a stochastic programming model is discussed. The final part will suggest various possible extensions into other areas.

## 5. A Short Note on SANS
### Author(s):
- Ernest Koenigsberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
In the SANS [O'Brien, G. G., H. S. Sherwood, R. E. Trueman. 1960. SANS, a simplified account numbering system. New York University J. Retailing (April); Trueman, R. E. 1961. Development of an efficient account-numbering method. Management Sci.7 265.] system, which attempts to reduce alphabetical and numerical files to a single file, problems of overflow occur when new members fall between two existing members with consecutive numbers. A method is given for determining the probability distributions of overflows in a cell of size 2k, and the mean value and variance of these distributions as functions of the growth of the system. In this paper we use some of the results of another paper on a related problem [Jewell, W. S. 1962. A filing problem. Management Sci.8 210.] to formulate the problem and obtain a solution. The mathematical treatment outlined can be extended to the calculation of other important parameters, including the expected number of entries which will be out-of-order within a group of areas, and the probability that the last overflow area will itself have an overflow.

## 6. A Filing Problem
### Author(s):
- William S. Jewell
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
n samples are drawn from a known distribution, ordered and placed in groups inside file drawers with a previously decided number of samples going in each drawer; the initial (ordered) sample in a drawer defines the “beginning” of a drawer, and the initial (ordered) sample of the next drawer defines the “end” of the drawer under consideration. If N new samples are drawn from the same distribution, what is the probability that x of them fall “inside” a given filing drawer? Is it shown that this probability depends only on the number of original samples “inside” a drawer, and is independent of the original sampling distributions and of the original sample which defines the beginning of the drawer. Hence, if the design objective is to equalize the overflow probability of each drawer, the best a priori policy is to divide the original ordered samples equally among the file drawers.

## 7. Some Experimental Non-Zero Sum Games with Lack of Information About the Rules
### Author(s):
- Martin Shubik
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1962
### Abstract:
A discussion of the relationship between the theory of games and experimental gaming is presented. This includes comments on games of indefinite length and lack of knowledge concerning the rules. Six simple games are constructed and examined in the light of four different solution concepts. These games were used in an experiment with a class of Yale seniors as the subjects. The results of these experiments are discussed. They appear to lend weight to the non-cooperative equilibrium concept of solution.
