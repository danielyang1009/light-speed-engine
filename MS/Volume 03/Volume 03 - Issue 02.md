## 1. The Institute of Management Sciences: Progress Report
### Author(s):
- Gifford H. Symonds
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) was formally organized on December 1, 1953. Sixty-three charter members adopted the constitution and by-laws of the society and confirmed the objectives of the Institute: “To identify, extend, and unify scientific knowledge that contributes to the understanding and practice of management.” Of the charter members, approximately one-third are academic people and about two-thirds represent industry and business. All were united in their belief in scientific foundation for the field of management.

## 2. Thoughts on Linear Programming and Automation
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
We have all become increasingly aware of the postwar trend towards automation, which is an advanced form of mechanization. Mechanization's purpose is to relieve man of certain duties using human energy for power; automation's purpose is to relieve him of certain mental tasks and the related physical tasks necessary for their expression. Most of us sense that electronic computers, which are themselves examples of automation, will play an important role in the mechanization of control processes of the routine type.

## 3. Mathematical Programming and Service Scheduling
### Author(s):
- W. Karush
- A. Vazsonyi
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
There are many business situations where it might be necessary to keep the potential service level (preparedness) above requirements at least in some of the time intervals. For instance, a fleet of trucks (or cabs) or group of production machines, cannot be easily adjusted month by month and, therefore, during slack periods the potential service level may exceed requirements. In a manufacturing firm, there are certain functions to be performed, such as maintenance or clerical work (often overhead type functions), where again the potential service level is expensive to change. In fact, even in the case of production workers, the expense of hiring, training, firing, or the contractual obligations of guaranteed wage agreements may make it undesirable to change the level of employment during slack periods. The reader will readily find further illustrations of the type of planning problems we are describing here.

## 4. Application of Linear Programming to Investments in the Electric Power Industry
### Author(s):
- P. Massé
- R. Gibrat
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
In France, the investment operations in basic industries, notably in the railroad, coal, electricity, and gas sectors, are submitted for approval of the government and the parliament. The authors of these programs have thus to determine the most economical solution of problems and then to enlighten and persuade the authorities in charge of approving operations. Towards the end of 1954 and the beginning of 1955, in the course of undertaking these tasks we found ourselves independently faced with remarkably similar problems.

## 5. Shorthand for Defense Planning
### Author(s):
- Clark L. Hosmer
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
This is to describe a proposal for comparing assumptions about the risks of war with our capabilities to handle those risks. The proposed method offers a concise, shorthand way to bring into focus the key parts of the defense planning picture. It is not a short cut to answers but it is a shorter, clearer way to present what the answers are at any one time.

## 6. Programming Resource Use and Capital Investment in Agriculture
### Author(s):
- R. A. King
- C. E. Bishop
- J. G. Sutherland
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
This paper describes how linear programming procedures have been used at North Carolina State College to determine optimal combinations of products for farm firms and to specify the quantities of capital that farmers would find it profitable to invest. It shows how the introduction of risk considerations may alter drastically programs which are obtained for certain situations. The usefulness of the technique in evaluating soil conservation practices, farm leasing arrangements and related problems is pointed out.

## 7. Statistical Sampling Techniques in the Aging of Accounts Receivable in a Department Store
### Author(s):
- R. M. Cyert
- Robert M. Trueblood
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1957
### Abstract:
In the economic systems of most industrial countries the bulk of the sales made by business concerns of any significant size is in the form of credit sales. In large retail outlets such as department stores, credit sales become even more important and the number of accounts receivable becomes exceedingly large. Under such conditions the proper credit policy to be followed becomes a management problem of the first magnitude. In addition to the proper credit policy it is necessary for management to determine the proper reserve for uncollectibles. One of the traditional methods of generating information on these questions has been the aging of the accounts receivable. It is precisely on management problems of this kind, where good information about large masses of data must be derived, that modern statistical sampling techniques can play an important role. When the data for decision-making purposes are the result of a statistical sample, management has an objective measure of the quality of the data on which the decision may be made. The specific objective of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of statistical sampling in the aging of receivables for the purpose of setting the allowance for uncollectibles.
