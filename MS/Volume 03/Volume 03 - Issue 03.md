## 1. Air Force Progress in Logistics Planning
### Author(s):
- Walter Jacobs
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
This is a progress report on the Air Force use of scientific procedures in programming and planning. The use of scientific methods, in the development of Air Force programs and plans and in the determination of the logistic support required, has occurred primarily in association with the use of large-scale electronic data processing systems. Therefore, in discussing progress I will be dealing for the most part with work done in connection with such systems.

## 2. Limitations of the Scientific Method in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Ernest H. Weinwurm
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
The scientists who have suggested improvements of the techniques of managerial analysis and decision making through the application of the “scientific method” have called attention to a worthwhile and important goal. Their proposals are bound to initiate a process of self-analysis and re-appraisal of the current methodical foundations of managerial policies. But the challenge in itself—even if made in a very determined manner—is no proof of its correctness and adequacy though this seems to be the opinion of some of the challengers.

## 3. A Linear Programming Solution to Dynamic Leontief type Models
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
Much research has been undertaken in the past several years on the uses of Leontief input-output matrices; applications have been made ranging from industrial growth models to models of interregional dynamics to estimates of structural changes in the economy. This paper discusses a general linear programming formulation of Leontief type relationships. Since we may construct models for a single firm analogous to Leontief macro-economic systems, our results are applicable to a wide variety of situations.

## 4. The Elimination form of the Inverse and its Application to Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Harry M. Markowitz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
It is common for matrices in industrial applications of linear programming to have a large proportion of zero coefficients. While every item (raw material, intermediate material, end item, equipment item) in, say, a petroleum refinery may be indirectly related to every other, any particular process uses few of these. Thus the matrix describing petroleum technology has a small percentage of non-zeros. If spacial or temporal distinctions are introduced into the model the percentage of non-zeros generally falls further.

## 5. On a Dynamic Programming Approach to the Caterer Problem—I
### Author(s):
- Richard Bellman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
In this paper, it is shown that the “caterer” problem, a problem in mathematical economics and logistics which has been discussed by Jacobs, Gaddum, Hoffman and Sokolowsky, and Prager, can be reduced to the problem of determining the maximum of the linear form, subject to a series of “triangular” constraints in the form of inequalities, under an assumption concerning the non-accumulation of dirty laundry. This maximization problem is solved explicitly, using the functional equation technique of dynamic programming.

## 6. The Trim Problem
### Author(s):
- Kurt Eisemann
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1957
### Abstract:
A problem of primary significance to a variety of industries is the suppression of trim losses in cutting rolls of paper, textiles, cellophane, metallic foil, or other material, for the execution of business orders. This problem is amenable to solution by the application of mathematical tools. We shall illustrate the general treatment of such problems by demonstrating a numerical example.
