## 1. Method of Appraising Economic Prospects of Mining Exploration over Large Territories: Algerian Sahara Case Study
### Author(s):
- M. Allais
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
The present study has essentially been conceived as a part of a larger study in the field of operations research. Its purpose resides in the scientific detection of the best and economically optimal strategy to be used in prospecting for metal deposits in the Sahara. The purpose of mining exploration is to discover workable deposits, and to acquire certain information on the natural wealth. This, of course, will involve certain costs. With zero expenditure there is zero information. But the cost of complete information would be inconceivable. Between these two extremes there is an optimum which we propose to seek.

## 2. The Use of Psychology in Industry: A Trade Union Point of View
### Author(s):
- William Gomberg
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
Our principal object is to examine the industrial arena in which the psychologist is active. A short excursion is taken into the fields of aptitude testing and the psychological evaluation of industrial engineering techniques. However, the major portion of our treatment is reserved for the human relations area.

## 3. A Note on the Modigliani-Hohn Production Smoothing Model
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Manne
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
Modigliani and Hohn [Modigliani, F., F. E. Hohn. 1955. Production planning over time. Econometrica23 (1, January) 46–66.] have formulated a production planning and inventory control model that appears relevant to an important class of non-stochastic decision-making problems. It is the purpose of this note to suggest: (1) that the Modigliani Hohn problem may be studied in terms of linear programming as well as through the calculus model originally employed; (2) that by working through the stock-flow relationships, it is possible to effect certain conceptual and computational improvements over Edward Bowman's original method for converting this type of problem into the “transportation” form [Bowman, E. H. 1956. Production scheduling by the transportation method of linear programming. J. Oper. Res. Soc. America4 (1, February) 100–103.]; and (3) that the linear programming version is especially suitable for tracing out the cost implications of stabilizing the work force at alternative levels. Like the “caterer problem” [Jacobs, W. 1954. The caterer problem. Naval Res. Logist. Quart.1 (2, June) 154–165.] and the “warehousing problem” [Charnes, A., W. W. Cooper. 1955. Generalizations of the warehousing model. Oper. Res. Quart.6 (4, December) 131–172.], this linear programming model represents another instance in which every basis is pure triangular and contains no elements but zero, +1, and −1.

## 4. The Development of Organizations in a Laboratory
### Author(s):
- Harold Guetzkow
- Anne E. Bowes
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
Does it seem feasible to attempt acceleration of the development of basic knowledge about organizations by utilizing the methodological advances which have occurred in the study of small groups? Specifically, how might the small group laboratory procedures of the social psychologist and sociologist be adapted to the study of organizations? Someday it may be possible to characterize social collectivities on a “meaningful set of orthogonal (independent) dimensions;” then “the definition of group and the discrimination of group from no-group [will] become arbitrary matters of convenience.” (1) In the meantime, it still seems fruitful to distinguish “small groups” from “organizations,” so that the extension of the methodologies from one area to the other is done with a modicum of circumspection. Groups are more or less stable configurations of persons in interaction. “Interaction” refers to the interlocking of the reactions of individuals to each other as stimulus objects.

## 5. On The Computational Solution of Linear Programming Problems Involving Almost-Block-Diagonal Matrices
### Author(s):
- Richard Bellman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
In this paper we wish to attack a problem which arises from the study of weakly coupled economic systems, or alternatively from the study of multi-stage processes with almost-independent stages. Here the “weakness” of coupling and the “almost-independence” is measured by the number of state variables at one stage which depend on the variables of the preceding stage. By means of the functional equation technique of dynamic programming, we shall show that the computational solution can be reduced to that of the computation of a sequence of functions of one variable, in the particular problem we treat.

## 6. Applications of Linear Programming in the Oil Industry
### Author(s):
- W. W. Garvin
- H. W. Crandall
- J. B. John
- R. A. Spellman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
This paper is the result of a survey made during the summer of 1956. It is a progress report on applications of linear programming by a number of oil companies. Examples are presented of applications to a variety of problems arising in the areas of Drilling and Production, Manufacturing, and Marketing and Distribution. The examples were selected to illustrate both the power and the limitations of present linear programming methods when applied to actual problems.

## 7. Ss Inventory Policy with Variable Delivery Time
### Author(s):
- Raoul J. Freeman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the question of determining an Ss inventory policy in the presence of delivery time being a random variable. Otherwise the usual conditions of the problem are retained (demand is considered a random variable, etc.). We will use the basic work of Whitin (Whitin, Thomson M. 1953. The Theory of Inventory Management. Princeton University Press, Princeton.), as a starting point, and develop our analysis as an extension of his exposition (where delivery time is taken as being constant). It will be our purpose to derive formulas for the determination of the order size and of the reordering point.

## 8. Sequential Production Planning Over Time at Minimum Cost
### Author(s):
- S. M. Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1957
### Abstract:
Production of a given commodity is to be scheduled over time to meet known future requirements while minimizing total costs. The costs include both storage and production costs as functions of time. The unit production cost is an increasing function of the production rate. Previous solutions to this problem have involved complicated iterative procedures. A new approach brings out the basic principle involved and leads to a surprisingly simple solution. This coincides with a common-sense technique sometimes used in business.
