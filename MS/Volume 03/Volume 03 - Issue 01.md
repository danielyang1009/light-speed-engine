## 1. Management Planning and Control—What Next?
### Author(s):
- Paul Kircher
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
How will electronics and scientific analysis change management planning and control? Five years ago this question held no interest for businessmen. Computers were used only for high speed calculation. There was none of the equipment needed for rapid input, and printed output, for rapid sorting, and for access to large volumes of storage. Five years ago a few scientists suspected that their new methods might be applied to business problems, but the change from the logistics of war to the planning and control of business proved more difficult than they had hoped. Now, five years later, the rush is on.

## 2. Formalism, Realism and Management Science
### Author(s):
- J. Sayer Minas
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
In most, if not all, of the standard examples of management science and Operations Research projects, it appears that somewhere along the line some part of the research effort has been devoted to a conceptualization or formalization of the system or process being studied. This conceptualization is very often called a model and may consist of a set of statements or may in fact be a physical representation of the system. It will be supposed that the term model is familiar enough to be used in a reasonably unambiguous way. The purpose of this paper is to define and discuss a problem related to models. It is felt that this is a serious problem, a problem which is becoming increasingly critical for the development of a unified science of management.

## 3. On the Caterer Problem
### Author(s):
- William Prager
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
In the present paper, the Caterer Problem is shown to be equivalent to a Hitchcock Distribution Problem [Hitchcock, F. L. 1941. The distribution of a product from several sources to numerous locations. J. Math. Phys.20 224–230.] with a very special cost matrix. For the case q = p − 1, a simple procedure taking advantage of this fact is developed and shown to yield Jacobs' solution. The possible extension of the procedure to the case p − q > 1 is illustrated by a numerical example.

## 4. Solving the Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- L. R. Ford, Jr.
- D. R. Fulkerson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
A simplified description of a new computing procedure for the Hitchcock-Koopmans transportation problem is given, together with a step by step solution of an illustrative example. The procedure is based on Kuhn's combinatorial algorithm for the assignment problem and a simple “labeling process” for solving maximal flow problems in networks. The proposed computation appears to be considerably more efficient than the specialized form of the simplex method which is in common use.

## 5. Optimal Design and Utilization of Communication Networks
### Author(s):
- R. E. Kalaba
- M. L. Juncosa
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
It is shown that a number of fundamental optimal routing and design problems for communication networks consisting of facilities for transmission, switching, relaying, etc., may be treated in a straightforward, computationally feasible manner by linear programming methods. These methods provide a general system approach for resolving the complex interactions among system capacities, users' demands, and economic factors. Various aspects of implementation and generalizations are discussed.

## 6. The Allocation of Aircraft to Routes—An Example of Linear Programming Under Uncertain Demand
### Author(s):
- Allen R. Ferguson
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate an application of linear programming to the problem of allocation of aircraft to routes in order to maximize expected profits when there is uncertain customer demand. The approach is intuitive; the theoretical basis of this work is found in an earlier study. The allocations are compared with those obtained under the usual procedure of assuming a fixed demand equal to the expected value. The computational procedure is similar to the fixed demand case, with only slightly more computational effort required.

## 7. A Model for the Optimal Programming of Railway Freight Train Movements
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- M. H. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
The area of railroad scheduling and associated problems offers a potentially fruitful field for research in management science. The mass of data; the need for considering numerous aspects of the problem simultaneously; and the variety of restrictions (arising from the technology, labor agreements and government regulation) make the control of day to day operations a management problem of great complexity. The problems at this level are further compounded by the need for developing, at the same time, methods for planning and evaluating major changes in facilities. Such methods, if they are to be effective, must be capable of tracing out the implications of these changes on the day to day operation and appraising the results in the light of the long-run objectives of the railroad. This paper is an account of an attempt to apply certain techniques of management science to some of these scheduling problems as they were found to exist on a large terminal switching railroad.

## 8. Variety in Retailing
### Author(s):
- William J. Baumol
- Edward A. Ide
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
Many marketing problems which promise to be amenable to the techniques of operations research have apparently not been subjected to systematic analysis. This article is a first attempt at an analysis of one such area—the number of items stocked by a retailer and its relation to his sales, his costs, and his profits.

## 9. Capital Equipment Analysis: The Required Rate of Profit
### Author(s):
- Myron J. Gordon
- Eli Shapiro
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
The interest in capital equipment analysis that has been evident in the business literature of the past five years is the product of numerous social, economic, and business developments of the postwar period. No conclusive listing of these developments can be attempted here. However, four should be mentioned which are of particular importance in this search for a more systematic method for discovering, evaluating, and selecting investment opportunities. These are: (1) the high level of capital outlays (in absolute terms); (2) the growth in the size of business firms; (3) the delegation of responsibility for initiating recommendations from top management to the profit center, which has been part of the general movement toward decentralization; and (4) the growing use of “scientific management” in the operations of the business firm.

## 10. Dynamic Programming and the Smoothing Problem
### Author(s):
- Richard Bellman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1956
### Abstract:
A problem in the study of production smoothing leads to the problem of minimizing a linear form subject to constraints of the type xi ≧ 0, . A computational solution of this problem is given, using the methods of dynamic programming.
