## 2. A Generalized Model of Administrative Decisions: An Experimental Test
### Author(s):
- Gary W. Dickson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
A model intended to predict decisions made from among alternatives having fixed characteristics is hypothesized and the experimental procedure used to test the model and the results of testing the model are presented. The model, which is based upon decision segmentation and disutility minimization, was tested in the framework of vendor selection decisions. The results indicate that the model was able to predict the vendor selections of the purchasing agent-subjects with a high degree of accuracy.

## 3. Chance Constrained Programming of the Machine Loading Problem with Stochastic Processing Times
### Author(s):
- M. Resh
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
The statistical model of a chance constrained variable which is the sum of stochastically independent random variables is considered, using the machine loading problem as an expository case. The resulting chance constrained statement, Pr {∑ni=1∑xik=0aik ≥ H} ≤ β, is shown to be different in substance from the classical case, Pr{∑ni=1a′ixi ≤ H} ≥ β, where xi denotes the variable of the program and aik and a′i denote the random variables. A formal mathematical analysis is carried out on the deterministic equivalent nonlinear problem with solutions over a set that may be nonconvex. The mathematical results are then used in stating and evaluating a linear approximation, thus enabling one to state the problem using a generalized transportation problem formulation.

## 4. A Simplex Method for a Class of Nonconvex Separable Problems
### Author(s):
- Guy Alloin
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
In this paper we present an extension of the simplex procedure to deal with separable programming problems where the objective is composed of functions which are either convex or concave and where the feasible solution set is convex.

## 5. Smoothing Start-Up and Shut-Down Costs: Concave Case
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
We consider nonstationary deterministic production smoothing problems with coats for starting and halting production. Inventory holding costs and production costs are assumed to be concave. The algorithms developed for optimal policies exploit known features of the economic lot size problem.

## 6. The Effectiveness of the Cognitive-Style Constraint in Implementing Operations Research Proposals
### Author(s):
- Jan H. B. M. Huysmans
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
This paper describes a laboratory experiment designed to test the impact of cognitive style differences between operations researcher and manager on the managerial implementation of operations research recommendations. Three hypotheses are presented and the results of their testing in the experiment are discussed.

## 7. A Production Scheduling Model by Bivalent Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Christoph Haehling von Lanzenauer
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
The paper focuses on multi-stage production systems. If such a system is of the more general type than a production line and many products have to be manufactured according to different technological sequence restrictions then two problems arise: (1) scheduling and (2) sequencing. The formulation of that problem requires the simultaneous consideration of the scheduling and sequencing aspect. The paper integrates these two functions into one single model using zero-one programming.

## 8. Blocking and Delays in M(x)/M/c Bulk Arrival Queueing Systems
### Author(s):
- Irwin W. Kabak
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
This paper presents results for queueing systems that are characterized by poisson arrival epochs with x (a random variable) arrivals at each epoch, exponential service times and c servers. The steady state probabilities, the probability of blocking (not being served immediately) for both loss and delay systems are investigated. In addition, the average delay, the variance of the delay and the delay distribution for first-come-served by batches and arbitrary order of service within batches are presented.

## 9. A Simple Optimality Proof of Moore's Sequencing Algorithm
### Author(s):
- L. B. J. M. Sturm
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1970
### Abstract:
In a recent article J. M. Moore [Moore, J. M. 1968. An n job, one machine sequencing algorithm for minimizing the number of late jobs. Management Sci.14(1, September) 102–109.] gave an algorithm for minimizing the number of late jobs in a one machine sequencing problem. As indicated by the author, T. J. Hodgson has proposed a simpler version of this algorithm, for which version the proof of optimality is similar to the proof given by the author for the original algorithm. In this note a simpler proof of optimality, based on the inductive principle, will be presented for Hodgson's algorithm. As Moore's algorithm only differs on minor points, this proof covers it as well.
