## 1. Nonlinear Activity Analysis
### Author(s):
- A. C. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
From a narrow point of view, linear programming is a method for calculating optimal operations plans for various corporate activities. From a broader point of view, however, the theory of linear programming provides a basis for the study of the economics of corporate activity. See, e.g., [Baumol, W. S. 1961. Economic Theory and Operations Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N. J.] For example, by providing existence theorems it is possible in many instances to say whether a proposed operation is possible at all; by providing characterization theorems it is possible to identify which variables are important and which are not, and what their relationships must be for optimal operation. The case of nonlinear convex programming is similar. Narrowly viewed, it provides a basis for the calculation of optimal operations plans. Broadly viewed, the theory ought to provide an even broader insight into the economics of corporate activity, but until recently no really satisfactory mathematical theory has been available. The work of R. T. Rockafellar [Rockafellar, R. T. 1967. Convex programming and systems of elementary monotonic relations. J. Math. Anal. Appl.19(3) 543–564; Rockafellar, R. T. 1967. Duality and stability in extremum problems involving convex functions. Pacific J. Math.21(1) 167–187.] now appears to fill this need, and in this paper we begin the development of a more general theory of the economics of corporate activity, from the activity analysis [Koopmans, T. C. 1951. Analysis of production as an efficient combination of activities. T. C. Koopmans, ed. Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 33–97.] point of view.

## 2. When a Queue Looks the Same to an Arriving Customer as to an Observer
### Author(s):
- Ralph E. Strauch
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
In a queue with a Poisson arrival distribution, the probability distribution state of the queue at any time is independent of whether or not an arrival occurs at that time. In particular, in a stationary queue with Poisson arrivals, the stationary distribution of the number of waiting customers in the queue at an arbitrary time is equal to the stationary distribution of the number of customers waiting in the queue when a new customer arrives.

## 3. Random Variables, the Time Value of Money and Capital Expenditures
### Author(s):
- Irwin W. Kabak
- Joel Owen
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
This paper treats the following problem. How much money should be invested at time t0 at an interest rate of I for a time T such that the probability of the funds required “K(T)” exceeding those available “X(T)” equals at most p. That is P{K(T) > X(T)} ≤ p, where X(T) = X(t0) exp{ I(T − t0)}. The parameters I, T, X(T) and K(T) are taken to be random variables. The theory to solve the stated problem is presented and solutions to certain specific cases are given.

## 5. Modular Allocation Technique (MAT)
### Author(s):
- Harry K. Edwards
- Billy E. Gillett
- Monta E. Hale
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
The major problem in “layout” is to determine the most economical relative location of facilities. MAT is a construction technique utilizing the distances between all pairs of locations and the loads transported between all pairs of facilities per unit time to approximate the optimal allocation of the facilities to the locations. The MAT general algorithm, an example problem and a theorem relating the MAT solution to the optimal solution are given. A computer program has been written that will apply MAT to the allocation problem for a maximum of 40 facilities.

## 6. A Note on Optimal Maintenance Policy and Sale Date of a Machine
### Author(s):
- S. R. Arora
- P. T. Lele
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
In the paper “Optimal Maintenance Policy and Sale Date of a Machine,” Dr. G. L. Thompson [Thompson, G. L. 1968. Optimal maintenance policies and sale date of a machine. Management Sci.14(9, May) 543–550.] provided a model to interrelate economic life and maintenance policy, using Pontryagin's maximum principle. His results are very interesting, but these can be made more representative of the real life by a simple modification of the deterioration function d(t).

## 7. Stochastic Capacity Models
### Author(s):
- Richard J. Giglio
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
Capacity of a facility is defined as its maximum rate of production. Although capacity can be changed by paying the appropriate capital costs, it is often impossible or undesirable to expand or contract capacity to meet exactly a time-varying demand. This paper presents work designed to help determine the optimal amount and timing of capacity expansions for situations where demand or facility life are stochastic. A series of models is developed to handle time stationary and nonstationary demand functions and approximations are presented allowing the use of modified deterministic models to solve stochastic problems.

## 8. Lagrangian Subgradients
### Author(s):
- Richard C. Grinold
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
There is a dual program linked with every nonlinear program. The dual objective function is called the Lagrangian; it is defined in terms of the original problem. This note presents a characterization of the Lagrangian subgradients under general conditions. The theorem follows from a result of Danskin [1] that can be used (see [2]) to characterize the Lagrangian directional derivatives. These characterizations are theoretically interesting and may be useful in computing optimal dual solutions. Rockafellar's outstanding book, [3], is used as a basic reference; it contains a wealth of background and historical information.

## 9. Detecting “Small” Mean Shifts in Time Series
### Author(s):
- John U. Farley
- Melvin J. Hinich
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
Analyzing time series data for evidence of changes in market conditions is a problem central to development of a marketing information system. Examples are tracking field reports on competitors' prices and analyzing market share estimates computed from retail audits and consumer panel reports. These series may involve substantial random measurement error, and any changes, often small relative to this error, are difficult to detect promptly and accurately. One way to approach this problem is with techniques recently developed for handling time series with small stochastic mean shifts as well as random error. Two special procedures are compared in Monte Carlo analyses with a simpler data filtering and control-chart approach; the latter appears the most promising.

## 10. A Selection Problem of Shared Fixed Costs and Network Flows
### Author(s):
- J. M. W. Rhys
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
An apparently combinatorial problem is defined, and a method given for solution by reduction to a network flow problem. The basic problem defined is that of assessing the desirability of incurring a number of fixed costs, when the benefits to be obtained cannot be related to individual cost-incurring items (facilities) but only to combinations.

## 11. Adaptive Smoothing using Evolutionary Spectra
### Author(s):
- Ambar G. Rao
- Arthur Shapiro
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
The importance of adaptive and exponentially smoothed forecasting has led to the development of several schemes using the tracking signal or the smoothed autocorrelation function for changing the value of the smoothing coefficient. An alternative scheme, using evolutionary spectra is proposed. The smoothing constant is determined as a function of the maximum change in the various frequency components of successive spectra. The location and magnitude of this maximum change also indicates the type of disturbance in the underlying stochastic process generating the series. Simulation experiments indicate that the use of spectra in this evolutionary fashion produces forecasts that are generally more stable as well as more sensitive to genuine changes than schemes based on the tracking signal.

## 12. An r-Dimensional Quadratic Placement Algorithm
### Author(s):
- Kenneth M. Hall
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
In this paper the solution to the problem of placing n connected points (or nodes) in r-dimensional Euclidean space is given. The criterion for optimality is minimizing a weighted sum of squared distances between the points subject to quadratic constraints of the form X′X = 1, for each of the r unknown coordinate vectors. It is proved that the problem reduces to the minimization of a sum or r positive semi-definite quadratic forms which, under the quadratic constraints, reduces to the problem of finding r eigenvectors of a special “disconnection” matrix. It is shown, by example, how this can serve as a basis for cluster identification.

## 13. Notes—On a Selection Problem
### Author(s):
- M. L. Balinski
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1970
### Abstract:
John Rhys [Rhys, J. 1970. Shared fixed cost and network flows. Management Sci.17(3, November).], and then J. D. Murchland [Murchland, J. D. 1968. Rhys's combinatorial station selection problem. Report LBS-TNT-68, London Graduate School of Business Studies, Transport Network Theory Unit, June 10.], have discussed a model aimed at making an optimal selection in a particular situation having several applications. This note shows how this problem can be solved by identifying minimum cuts with optimal selection.
