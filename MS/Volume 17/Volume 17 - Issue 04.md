## 1. Decision-Making in a Fuzzy Environment
### Author(s):
- R. E. Bellman
- L. A. Zadeh
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
By decision-making in a fuzzy environment is meant a decision process in which the goals and/or the constraints, but not necessarily the system under control, are fuzzy in nature. This means that the goals and/or the constraints constitute classes of alternatives whose boundaries are not sharply defined.

## 2. Horizon Models for Social Development
### Author(s):
- A. Charnes
- M. J. L. Kirby
- A. S. Walters
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
This paper discusses models for planning the social development of a country. These models are intended to provide some understanding and assessment of inter-temporal changes in social groups through industrial, educational, health, etc. opportunities and constraints over a time horizon. They thus include constraints and goals for planning the improvement in living conditions and the upgrading of different segments of society. The models also make extensive use of various sociological factors. While these models are presented in the context of a developing nation, the concepts, attributes and formalisms are not limited to such cases.

## 3. An Approach to the Analysis of Vocational Education and Training Requirements
### Author(s):
- Fumio Kodama
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
Systematic approaches to the problems of education and training are difficult because so many social and psychological variables are involved.

## 4. The “Investment '85” Model of Electricite de France
### Author(s):
- Francis Bessière
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
The purpose of the “Investment 85” model is to shed light on the evolution, up to 1985, of the optimal structure of electricity production equipment in France and to outline its geographical distribution by main regions. The model fits into the general pattern of theoretical studies which contribute to the preparation of investment decisions by Electricité de France. It was solved in 1965 and represents the status then current in the application of mathematical programming methods to investment decision problems faced by Electricité de France.

## 5. Computer Augmented Organizational Problem Solving
### Author(s):
- Robert Joyner
- Kenneth Tunstall
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
CONCORD (Conference Coordinator) is a computer program based on Cyert and March and Simon's theory of problem solving. It tutors groups in general strategies of problem solving. Groups interact with CONCORD in conversational mode over a remote terminal, and can bring it a wide variety of problems requiring coordination. The paper outlines the development of CONCORD and describes an experimental study comparing groups using CONCORD with those not using it in solving two problems. The study shows no difference between user and nonuser groups in quality of solutions to the two problems.

## 6. Analysis of a Decision Making Investigation
### Author(s):
- Kenneth D. Mackenzie
- F. Hutton Barron
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
Those management and social scientists dealing with organizational behavior are severely limited by the need for more operational theory and by the paucity of experimental data on important events and phenomena. The many practical and conceptual reasons why experiments in the classical sense cannot be conducted lead us to consider a less rigorous form of inquiry called an investigation. A possible heuristic procedure for analyzing data from investigations is proposed. The heuristic has the property that rather than selecting favorable events to support a theory, it codes and incorporates observed events systematically into a testing of theory. This procedure is applied to data from the Churchman-Ratoosh laboratory investigations of implementation processes. Our results are consistent with the assumption of a constant source diffusion of innovation process. Data for the diffusion process and attendant structural change are presented in terms of models. The application of the heuristic also suggests questions for further diffusion and implementation experiments.

## 7. Facilities Planning with Graph Theory
### Author(s):
- Jouko Seppänen
- James M. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
Basic concepts of Graph Theory are discussed which are relevant to solving problems of locating economic activities within a service or manufacturing facility. The location problem is formulated in terms of Graph Theory knowledge and a solution procedure proposed. An example is provided and finally boundary conditions are elaborated.

## 8. Marketing Science—The Value of Promotion
### Author(s):
- James P. Wallace, III
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
For this issue, I am pleased to demonstrate that something is being done to measure the effectiveness of sales promotion efforts. The following paper, from James Wallace of General Motors, discusses a general methodology for the problem posed in this column in October 1969. It is similar to other studies I am familiar with, but it is unique in that its sponsor is willing to have it published. With apologies to Dr. Wallace, it has been slightly abridged to make it fit in the alloted space.

## 10. Précis—Management Decision Models and Computers
### Author(s):
- Alfred L. Kahl, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1970
### Abstract:
This expository paper on the use of computers for management decision-making describes how decision models are created and used and points out some of the limitations of both models and computers. It seeks to help remove the inhibitions which some managers still have about computer assistance for top management decision-making problems. Most computers are now being used for routine cost reducing applications, but they instead should be used for complex management decision-making to enhance the profitability of the firm.
