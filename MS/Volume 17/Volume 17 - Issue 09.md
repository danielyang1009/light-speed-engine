## 2. A Control Problem of Bellman
### Author(s):
- George B. Dantzig
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
The control problem discussed in this paper is a variant of one considered by Bellman in a seminar at the RAND Corporation. A solution was presented to the seminar by the author in October 1952 based on the idea of placing a “loose” string between end points and “pulling tight.” Recently, Arthur Veinott has greatly extended the class of problems which admit a “string” solution. It appeared of value that the author publish his original notes on Bellman's problem. The problem will be considered here in a discrete version. The reader should have no difficulties developing its continuous analogue.

## 3. Least d-Majorized Network Flows with Inventory and Statistical Applications
### Author(s):
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
It is shown that for any feasible network flow model, there is a flow which simultaneously minimizes every d-Schur convex function of the flows emanating from a single distinguished node called the source. The vector of flows emanating from the source in the minimizing flow is unique and is the “least d-majorized” flow. This flow can be found by solving the problem for the special case where the d-Sehur convex function is separable and quadratic. Once this flow is found, the solution of the dual problem is reduced to evaluating the conjugate of a function appearing in the dual objective function at the above flow. This computation is extremely simple when the function is separable. These results are extended to situations in which the variables must be integers. An important special case of the problem can be solved geometrically by choosing, from among all paths joining two points in the plane and lying between two given nonintersecting paths, the path with minimum euclidian length. Applications of the results are given, to deterministic production-distribution models (e.g., the Modigliani-Hohn [30] production smoothing model), certain of the stochastic inventory-redistribution models examined by Ignall and Veinott [27], a deterministic price speculation and storage model (including Cahn's warehouse problem [11]), and a zero lead time case of the Clark-Scarf series multi-echelon model [13]. In addition, applications are given to several maximum likelihood estimation problems in which the parameters satisfy certain linear inequalities, e.g., those surveyed in Brunk [8], [9, pp. 1347–1349], and a few others.

## 4. Flows in Arborescences
### Author(s):
- Fred Glover
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
This paper gives efficient methods for solving four specially structured network problems that arise in connection with certain integer programming methods developed by Cook and Cooper, Hillier, and Glover. Such problems have also independently been studied in inventory theory by Ignall and Veinott, who have developed extensive qualitative (nonalgorithmic) implications of their structures. In the integer programming context, special subclasses of these network problems are generated and solved as part of a strategy for solving more general integer linear programs. By providing particularly efficient methods for accommodating somewhat broader network structures, our results enable the development of related integer programming solution strategies that generate more complex subproblems.

## 5. Quality Control under Markovian Deterioration
### Author(s):
- Sheldon M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
We suppose that a production process may be in any one of a countable number of states and that the quality of the item produced is a function of this underlying state. It is also supposed that the state of the process at time t is not known and only becomes known when an item is sampled. We suppose that there are inspection, production, and revision costs and provide a framework for handling problems of this nature. We also treat in detail a 2-state version of this problem, and in this case show that the optimal policy does not necessarily have the three region structure which intuition suggests.

## 6. Optimal Smoothing of Shipments in Response to Orders
### Author(s):
- Rein Peterson
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
In the American economy practically no penalty for fluctuations in placing orders is incurred by the ordering company, even though such fluctuations are costly to manufacturers and to the economy as a whole. In particular, dynamic pricing by suppliers, which would communicate information on desirable and undesirable times for placing orders, is seldom used in practice. In this paper we extend the Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon (H.M.M.S.) aggregate production-work force scheduling model by not requiring the manufacturer to ship exactly what is ordered. Our model provides a means of balancing the costs and benefits (to the manufacturer) of smoothing shipments in response to orders and therefore could be used as an aid in establishing dynamic prices.

## 8. The Linear Complementarity Problem
### Author(s):
- B. Curtis Eaves
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
This study centers on the task of efficiently finding a solution of the linear complementarity problem: Ix − My = q, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x ⊥ y. The main results are: (1) It is shown that Lemke's algorithm will solve (or show no solution exists) the problem for M ∈ L where L is a class of matrices, which properly includes (i) certain copositive matrices, (ii) certain matrices with nonnegative principal minors, (iii) matrices for bimatrix games. (2) If M ∈ L, if the system Ix − My = q, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 is feasible and nondegenerate, then the corresponding linear complementarity problem has an odd number of solutions. If M ∈ L and q > 0 then the solution is unique. (3) If for some M and every q ≥ 0 the problem has a unique solution then M ∈ L and the problem has a solution for every q. (4) If M has nonnegative principal minors and if the linear complementarity with M and q has a nondegenerate complementary solution then the solution is unique. (5) If yTMy + yTq is bounded below on y ≥ 0 then the linear complementarity problem with M and q has a solution and Lemke's algorithm can be used to find such a solution. If, in addition, the problem is nondegenerate, then it has an odd number of solutions. (6) A procedure based on Lemke's algorithm is developed which either computes stationary points for general quadratic programs or else shows that the program has no optimum. (7) If a quadratic program has an optimum and satisfies a nondegeneracy condition then there are an odd number of stationary points.

## 9. Economically Optimal Determination of the Parameters of X̄-Control Chart
### Author(s):
- Isaac N. Gibra
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
This paper seeks a theoretical basis for determining the optimal parameters of the X̄-chart under the specified conditions. These parameters are the sample size, the factor determining the spread of the control limits, and the intersample interval. The paper shows how to determine these parameters under sound practical assumptions so that the relevant cost function is minimized. Illustrative examples show how the formulated model can be applied.

## 10. Computing Expected Values of Customer Requests Backordered
### Author(s):
- Alan J. Kaplan
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
Suppose that the stockout cost for a supplier is a function of the number of customer requests backordered, each request possibly being for several units of stock of a product. The problem arises of computing the expected number of customer requests backordered. when techniques are available for computing the expected number of units backordered. A simple conversion factor is desirable. Based on a formal analysis, the conversion factor 1/E(X) is recommended where E(X) is average size of a customer request. This conclusion is contrary to that reached in previously published research.

## 11. A Shuttle Car Assignment Problem in the Mining Industry
### Author(s):
- Gary H. Reynolds
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
Shuttle cars form a part of the standard equipment employed by the mining industry in the transportation of coal when using the room-and-piller method for extracting coal from underground seams. These cars are subject to frequent failure, so the problem of assigning shuttle cars to sections of the mine is considered in this paper, with the objective of maximizing expected output. A particularly simple solution is found that could be used readily by any mine foreman.

## 12. A Note on Marginal Allocation in Multiple-Server Service Systems
### Author(s):
- Alan J. Rolfe
### Published:
- 1 May 1971
### Abstract:
In this note we consider the allocation of servers to a multiple facility service system. Each facility consists of a number of parallel channels and the arrival processes are Poisson. When service times are constant we prove that marginal allocation is an optimal and easily implemented solution technique and suggest that it is also optimal for exponential service times.
