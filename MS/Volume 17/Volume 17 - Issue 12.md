## 1. A Language for Organization Design: Part I
### Author(s):
- H. I. Ansoff
- R. G. Brandenburg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
This paper develops a language for designing the structure of a purposive organization so as to maximize organizational performance potential for achieving given objectives. Four categories of performance attributes are specified, each contributing to the particular objectives an organization pursues in seeking maximum return from the resources it employs:
steady-state efficiency,
operating responsiveness,
strategic responsiveness,
structural responsiveness.

## 3. Simulation Research in Interchangeable Part Manufacturing
### Author(s):
- Ashok R. Pai
- Keith L. McRoberts
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
Simulation is being used to attain a better understanding of many complex situations. In this analysis, GPSS/360 was employed as a simulation language to investigate the effects of operating policy guidelines and decision rules in the manufacture of component parts used interchangeably in the final product form. The analysis is developed on hypothetical data and interchangeable part mixture based on an actual manufacturing systems. A number of criterion measures are considered, and four policy decision rules are investigated.

## 4. On the Nature of the Cost-Benefit Schedule
### Author(s):
- Carl R. Jones
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
In this paper the nature of a set of coat-benefit studied alternatives is studied. An integrated set of submodels is assumed to provide the foundation for a cost-benefit schedule. The model is formulated as an efficiency problem using the technique of vector maximization. Efficient points are characterized by a set of decision rules. A local cost-benefit function is developed. Comparative statics (sensitivity analysis) results show that there exist efficiency substitution and benefit effects. These effects are the basis for rigorous definitions of efficiency substitutes and complements.

## 5. Optimal Bluffing Strategies in Poker
### Author(s):
- Lawrence Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
Bluffing in poker is examined as a problem in game theory. A very common situation occurs where the “kitty” contains K, player B has the apparent high hand, and player A has an apparent probability, P, of having a better hand than B, and considers a bluff. Under these conditions it can be shown that A should raise 1 unit with probability (1/(1 + K))(P/(1 − P)) · B, in turn, should call A's potential bluff with probability K/(1 + K). This says that in pot limit poker, if the potential bluffer has the appearance of having the winning hand with probability 0.25, he should bluff 1/2 · 1/3 = 1/6 of the time. The optimal strategy is to call a potential bluffing hand half the time.

## 6. A Comment on “Probability of Survival as an Investment Criterion” By Fred Hanssmann
### Author(s):
- D. J. Laughhunn
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
In a recent article of this journal, Hanssmann [Hanssmann, Fred. 1968. Probability of survival as an investment criterion. Management Sci.15(1, September) 33–48.] proposed probability of survival as an investment planning criterion. An earlier paper by Roy [Roy, A. D. 1952. Safety first and the holding of assets. Econometrica (July) 431–439.] has shown that the normality assumption is not necessary in order to utilize probability of survival in investment planning and that a result identical and Hanssmann's is possible in the absence of any specific assumption concerning the form of the probability distributions involved. Hence, use of probability of survival as an investment planning criterion requires only a relatively weak assumption concerning probability distributions of portfolio returns, i.e., finite means and variances. There is no need to assume normality or, for that matter, any specific form for portfolio probability distributions.

## 7. Probabilistic Forecasting for Contractors
### Author(s):
- H. E. Kierulff
- D. E. Robison
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
Firms that perform work on contract to others often estimate their sales by assigning a probability of award to each potential contract, finding the expected value of each contract and then summing these expected values. Our methodology provides a complete probability distribution around the company sales forecast mean with no further data input than that required to obtain the expected value. The full distribution more realistically portrays business prospects, and allows planners and decision makers to engage in more sophisticated probabilistic forecasting and alternatives analysis. The methodology has been programmed for the computer, and modified to allow for rapid and inexpensive calculation of both sales award and operating sales distributions for a large number of contracts.

## 8. An Implicit Enumeration Algorithm for the Machine Sequencing Problem
### Author(s):
- M. Florian
- P. Trepant
- G. McMahon
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
An implicit enumeration algorithm is developed for the machine sequencing problem. The method is based on the graph-theoretical representation of the problem. The convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated, and its efficiency is evaluated by experiments carried out with a code written for the CDC 6400 computer.

## 9. A Heuristic Programming Solution to a Nonlinear Cutting Stock Problem
### Author(s):
- Robert W. Haessler
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
A heuristic procedure for scheduling production rolls of paper through a finishing operation to cut them down to finished roll sizes is described. The ratio of service time to interarrival time of production rolls at the initial cutting station is large so that insufficient time is available to set it up unless a minimum number of production rolls are to be processed in the same manner. Otherwise, some portion of each production roll must go through a reprocessing operation to complete the cutting of finished sizes. The objective is to minimize the cost of trim loss and reprocessing.

## 10. An Algorithm for Optimal Project Scheduling under Multiple Resource Constraints
### Author(s):
- Edward W. Davis
- George E. Heidorn
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
An algorithm is described which permits the computation of optimal (minimum-duration) solutions for the resource-constrained project network scheduling problem under conditions of multiple resource requirements per job (activity). The approach is a form of bounded enumeration and employs techniques originally developed for the solution of the assembly line balancing problem. Initial computational results are given, along with an example of the type problems solved. Among the advantages of the procedure are that resource requirements can vary over job duration, and various assumptions concerning job continuity are allowable, with no extra computational effort.

## 11. Utility Theory Applied to Multivariable System Effectiveness Evaluation
### Author(s):
- Efraim Turban
- Morton L. Metersky
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1971
### Abstract:
In this paper, utility and decision theories are applied to determine the effectiveness of a complex system with several measures of performance. A significant number of individuals, both systems analysts and operational personnel in the NADC and related organizations, were asked to rank the measures of performance according to their importance and to assign utility indices to each. Churchman and Ackoff's method for checking the consistency of the ranking has been modified and applied to the study. The evaluations of the individual judges were then adjusted, and the estimates of all judges were combined to form an overall utility index (measure of performance). The “Coefficient of Concordance” test was employed to measure the degree of agreement among the judges. The weighted overall measure of performance is used to evaluate proposed courses of action and to establish stopping rules for a simulation study.
