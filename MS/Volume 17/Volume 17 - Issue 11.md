## 1. Towards a System of Systems Concepts
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
The concepts and terms commonly used to talk about systems have not themselves been organized into a system. An attempt to do so is made here. System and the most important types of system are defined so that differences and similarities are made explicit. Particular attention is given to that type of system of most interest to management scientists: organizations. The relationship between a system and its parts is considered and a proposition is put forward that all systems are either variety-increasing or variety-decreasing relative to the behavior of its parts.

## 2. A Study of Lexicographic Expected Utility
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
A relation <L on a set of real vectors a, b, … is a lexicographic order when a <Lb if and only if a ≠ b and for every j such that bj < aj there is an i < j such that ai < bi. A simple and direct derivation is given for a multidimensional utility function whose lexicographically-ordered expected utility vectors preserve an individual's preference order on a set of probability measures. All but one of Hausner's axioms yield an equivalence on the set of preference intervals, and the resulting bet of equivalence classes is shown to account for the hierarchy in the lexicographic structure. A lexicographic utility representation is noted for the finite-dimensional case. When Hausner's other axiom is added, his theorem for lexicographic linear utility is obtained. This theorem is applied to sets of simple and discrete probability measures.

## 3. Optimal Management of a Research and Development Project
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Lucas, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
This paper offers a series of models designed to aid in the evaluation and control of an individual research and development project. The project under consideration is assumed to involve costs incurred over a period [0, T] and a return earned at T (or discounted to T) when the project is completed. In two of the models discussed below, the completion time T is regarded as known; in two others, T is taken to be a random variable with a known distribution. In two models, the costs per unit of time of operating the project are assumed to be fixed; in the other two, costs are variable, with increased expenditure resulting in a decreased completion time. Each of the four possible combinations of assumptions is treated in a separate section. The last section contains a summary and discussion of results.

## 4. On Quadratic Programming
### Author(s):
- B. Curtis Eaves
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
A procedure based on Lemke's algorithm is developed which either computes stationary points for general quadratic programs or else shows that the program has no optimum. If a general quadratic program has an optimum and satisfies a non-degeneracy condition then it is demonstrated that there are an odd number of stationary points.

## 5. Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network
### Author(s):
- Jin Y. Yen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for finding the K loopless paths that have the shortest lengths from one node to another node in a network. The significance of the new algorithm is that its computational upper bound increases only linearly with the value of K. Consequently, in general, the new algorithm is extremely efficient as compared with the algorithms proposed by Bock, Kantner, and Haynes [2], Pollack [7], [8], Clarke, Krikorian, and Rausan [3], Sakarovitch [9] and others. This paper first reviews the algorithms presently available for finding the K shortest loopless paths in terms of the computational effort and memory addresses they require. This is followed by the presentation of the new algorithm and its justification. Finally, the efficiency of the new algorithm is examined and compared with that of other algorithms.

## 6. A Statistical Theory for Pert in Which Completion Times of Activities are Inter-Dependent
### Author(s):
- Larry J. Ringer
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for taking into account dependency among certain activities in PERT networks. The method presented can be used with the reduction algorithm presented by Hartley and Wortham [Hartley, H. O., Wortham, A. W., A statistical theory for PERT critical path analysis. Management Science, Vol. 12 No. 10 (June 1966), pp. B-469–B-481.]. The addition of dependency among the completion times for certain types of activities should be a valuable aid in sensitivity analyses of PERT networks.

## 7. Production Smoothing with Stochastic Demand II: Infinite Horizon Case
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
In an earlier paper [5], we generalized and extended Beckmann'a results [1] for a production and inventory problem with proportional smoothing costs and demands being random variables. Our previous results concerned the finite horizon nonstationary case. Here we consider the infinite horizon stationary case. Two curves in the plane determine an optimal policy. They are shown to have slopes between minus one and zero, to be differentiable, and to be bounded by two straight lines with a slope of minus one. These results are used (a) to accelerate each iteration of a successive approximations algorithm and (b) to formulate a linear programming problem from whose solution an optimal policy can be determined.

## 8. Constructing Sets of Uniformly Tighter Linear Approximations for a Chance Constraint
### Author(s):
- Yrjö Seppälä
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
The aim of this paper is to construct sets of uniformly tighter linear constraints to replace a chance constraint, in order to be able to solve the chance-constrained programming problem by the simplex method. The chance constraints are first diagonalized by a linear orthonormal transformation. Uniformly tighter linear constraints can then be formed to replace the chance constraint. The developed multistage linear programming problem can also be solved using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition technique. Approximation errors of our method and one of Hillier's [8] are compared.

## 9. Equipment Replacement Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Robert A. Meyer, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
This paper will present a model of equipment replacement in a stochastic environment utilizing a number of the component characteristics of an operations research orientation while being designed to emphasize the role of a stochastic representation of technological change and/or maintenance costs and the implications these have for the decision about replacement of equipment. The “replacement” referred to here is replacement of a machine in its entirety rather than the usual periodic-review-replacement-of-individual-pieces analysis to which the term “replacement” frequently refers in operations research literature. The paper outlines the approaches to equipment replacement in the literature of economics and the well-known Terborgh model and then introduces a stochastic model for studying certain aspects of equipment replacement together with the form of its analytic solution. A comparison of the cost implications of the Terborgh and stochastic model is presented for a specific example utilizing motor vehicle data. In addition, a general analytic comparison of the two replacement rules is provided.

## 10. An Algorithm for Separable Nonconvex Programming Problems II: Nonconvex Constraints
### Author(s):
- Richard M. Soland
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
We extend a previous algorithm in order to solve mathematical programming problems of the form: Find x = (x1, …, xn) to minimize ∑φi0(xi) subject to x ∈ G, l ≦ x ≦ L and ∑φij(xi) ≦ 0, j = 1, …, m. Each φij is assumed to be lower semicontinuous, possibly nonconvex, and G is assumed to be closed. The algorithm is of the branch and bound type and solves a sequence of problems in each of which the objective function is convex. In case G is convex each problem in the sequence is a convex programming problem. The problems correspond to successive partitions of the set C = { x ∣ l ≦ x ≦ L}. Two different rules for refining the partitions are considered; these lead to convergence of the algorithm under different requirements on the problem functions. An example is given, and computational considerations are discussed.

## 15. A Note on the Bergstrom-Smith Multi-Item Production Planning Model
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
- John O. McClain
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1971
### Abstract:
This note demonstrates that the model proposed by Bergstrom and Smith (B & S) for deterministic multi-item production planning can, with some reinterpretation, be used to solve two related stochastic multi-item production planning problems. Specifically, the benefits of individual item-by-item treatment and diminishing marginal revenue contained in the B & S model can be obtained when future sales are (i) stochastic and uncontrollable, or (ii) stochastic but with the mean value under the control of the firm. We demonstrate that under both of these situations the certainty-equivalence property holds, thereby reducing the two stochastic problems to two related deterministic problems.
