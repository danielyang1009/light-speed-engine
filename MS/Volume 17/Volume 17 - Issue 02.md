## 1. Preface to Some Papers on Educational Issues in the Management Sciences and Operations Research
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
In an era where many curricula are being examined for their relevance, it seems appropriate to explore the fundamental purpose of the graduate programs in management science. A letter was sent to a sample of educators asking for their statement that would be published in Management Science.

## 2. Some Ideas on Education in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Russell L. Ackoff
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The brevity of this statement hardly permits a position to be presented fully let alone defended adequately. Hence what follows are a set of assertions whose baldness gives them a dogmatic tone that they are not intended to have. Enough of apologies. There is no more space to spare. This discussion is divided into what I consider to be the four essential parts of an educational program in the Management Sciences: Foundations, Fundamentals, Frontiers, and Facility.

## 3. Purposes and Quality of Graduate Education in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- S. L. Cook
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The questions asked in Professor Churchman's letter of November 17, 1969, sound simple enough, but it would take a book to answer them fully. They are questions fundamental to the future of the management sciences. The statement below attempts to summarize the purpose and aims of the OR/Systems Section of the Department of Industrial Administration in the University of Aston in Birmingham, and to relate these to present and planned graduate courses. Since the present courses commenced less than two years ago and planned courses are some way off, most of our aims have yet to be achieved.

## 5. On Education in Management Science
### Author(s):
- Samuel Eilon
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The process of establishing management studies as a recognized academic discipline has been fraught with numerous difficulties. Even in the US with its very long tradition of tolerating these studies in the academic environment, where expansion of university activity in this area has been quite phenomenal since World War II, the arguments as to the scope and content of management studies have not abated, and will probably continue to rage for many years to come. The plethora of programmes, even the variety of titles used to describe them, is evidence of the divergence of views held on this subject. There are programmes of business administration run by powerful and popular business schools, there are programmes in operational research, in management science, in industrial management, in industrial engineering—to mention just some of the prevalent titles. They all have their own philosophies, their own emphasis on what is regarded as a relevant range of subjects that students should cover in some depth if they aspire to practise in some aspect of management during their future careers.

## 8. Some Comments on Graduate Education in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Gerald J. Lieberman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The educational goal of a graduate program in the management sciences should be to adequately prepare a student for a lifetime pursuit of any phase of management science he chooses. More specifically, the program should be designed for a student who desires a management science education to meet his career goal in either a university, business or government position. However, any educational program must distinguish between the objectives of a doctoral student and a terminal master's student. A program leading to a Ph.D. degree should be directed to those primarily interested in a teaching and research career in University, or a research career in business or government Training at the master's level should emphasize applications of the techniques associated with management science. Such technically trained personnel are often used to develop advanced planning methods and/or operating policies within a company.

## 9. What's OR-MS?
### Author(s):
- Sebastian B. Littauer
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
I believe that college departments' programs fall into two essential categories. The more common and less interesting type is that of the directed program, that is to say, the one which has been set either by the head of the department or by past tradition. As teachers are added to the staff the program goes on without any real searching thought. The other type of program is one that is genuinely thought out by the persons responsible and reflects the methods, ideas, capacities and caprices of various members of the faculty, although sometimes one vigorous member of the group essentially puts his stamp on the program. We will call this type the “freely evolved” program and this is the kind we will talk about.

## 10. Graduate Programs in Operational Research at Lancaster and Sussex
### Author(s):
- M. G. Simpson
- B. H. P. Rivett
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The Graduate programmes at Lancaster and Sussex have much in common. Although the areas of special interest are somewhat different the general philosophy matches closely, and it thus seems more compact to present our views on the main purposes of education in the Management Sciences jointly.

## 11. Some Comments on Graduate Education in the Management Sciences
### Author(s):
- Martin K. Starr
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
There are sundry purposes to be served by graduate education in the management sciences. These purposes include the development of professional abilities in model-building and mathematical model-transformation; and managerial implementation skills in model-use. These abilities require different mixtures of behavioral and quantitative sensitivities. Degrees of specialization and generalization are evidently in conflict both for teaching time and by the natural inclinations of various personality types (both students and teachers). It is unclear how (if at all) it is possible to achieve the purposes of specialization and generalization at the same time. Also, we know very little about how to combine behavioral and quantitative considerations.

## 12. Management Science Education
### Author(s):
- Robert M. Thrall
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
In this brief comment on education and management science I will focus my attention on what the universities should provide, recognizing (1) that this is only one part of a management scientist's education and (2) that not all management scientists fit into a single mold.

## 13. Operations Research as a Profession
### Author(s):
- C. West Churchman
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the profession of operations research and specifically with the preparation for the profession. On a fairly general plain, the paper expresses a concern about the future of a profession which ought to be in the lead in the growing societal anxiety over poverty, pollution and privacy, but in fact plays virtually no significant role in these matters.

## 15. Planning Tire Production
### Author(s):
- Samuel Gorenstein
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
An outline of the tire production process is given. A planning model is discussed and an application is made to the planning of tire production (both long and short term). Planning for finished tires, green tires and for components is included as the model is developed. A multi-item production planning program is presented for finished tires and this is expanded to an assembly model with precedences for green tires and for components.

## 16. Organizational Communications Systems and the Decision Process
### Author(s):
- Thomas P. Ference
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The emergence and solution of organizational problems are examined from the framework of the communications system. A general model is developed based on the information-processing activities of the individual members of a communications network. The model describes the problem-solving process as a sequence of five stages: problem recognition, identification procedures, information acquisition and integration, definition of constraint set, and comparison and adaptation. The relations among the critical variables of the model are then specified in a series of propositions. The main purpose of the model, as exemplified in the propositions, is to provide a testable framework for the empirical analysis of the decision process in organizations.

## 17. A Simulation of Labor Efficiency and Centralized Assignment in a Production Model
### Author(s):
- Rosser T. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
This paper reports a set of simulation experiments with a service system model in which labor interchange is possible between service centers. It explores design and control aspects of labor and machine limited systems. A simple model with two service centers and two laborers is employed to explore the relationships among three experimental variables. The variables are the efficiency of labor interchange, the degree of centralized control exercised in labor assignment, and the queue discipline. Both series and job-shop type job routings are studied.

## 18. The Product-Mix Problem under Stochastic Seasonal Demand
### Author(s):
- S. D. Hodges
- P. G. Moore
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The product-mix problem of production planning is to determine the best quantity of each product to manufacture, over a complete range of products competing for a number of limited resources. This paper examines the problem when uncertainty of demand is a major factor, making any differences between the penalties of over- and under-production important. In these circumstances the basic linear programming technique is insufficient, and a model has been developed as a multi-item newsboy problem in which a number of linear resource constraints affect the decision variables.

## 20. Information Systems in Management Science: Management Information System—What It Is and Why?
### Author(s):
- Harry Stern
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
The topic, “A Management Information System—What It is and Why” was suggested by work that I did recently in preparation for the German symposium, “MIS—A Challenge to Scientific Research.” In reviewing my own ideas about management information, I keep coming back to one primary thought, that the only value that information has to management is to allow better decisions to be made.

## 23. Précis—An Activity-Productivity Analysis of a Variable Task
### Author(s):
- Robert J. Paul
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1970
### Abstract:
This activity-productivity study applied quantitative methods to a large random sample of the highest volume and lowest volume performers engaged in nonmanual, nonrepetitive activities. Its objective was to note how the groups differed in terms of time utilization. With further study this information could provide useful insights for analysis in the areas of selection, training, performance evaluation and personnel appraisal.
