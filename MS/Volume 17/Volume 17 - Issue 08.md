## 1. Automating Judgmental Decision Making for a Serious Medical Problem
### Author(s):
- Norman E. Betaque
- G. Anthony Gorry
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
A decision theory model of the diagnosis and treatment of a serious medical condition, acute renal failure, has been implemented as part of a study of automated judgmental decision-making.

## 2. The New-Trier Stochastic Model of Brand Choice
### Author(s):
- David A. Aaker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
This paper presents a description and an empirical evaluation of a new stochastic model of brand choice, the new-trier model, developed to model the purchasing process following the first purchase of an unfamiliar (to the purchaser) brand. Empirical analysis and model refinement yields several interesting insights into consumer decision processes. Several managerial applications of the model are considered.

## 3. Three Pricing Policies for a Multi-Product Multi-National Company
### Author(s):
- David P. Rutenberg
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
A price leader must formulate list prices every time he introduces a new product line (fairly frequently in a technologically developing industry). This is not easy. When the company is multi-national, pricing policy becomes further complicated by the issues of centralization versus autonomy of the national subsidiaries, and three pricing schemes are encountered in practice.

## 4. Efficient Distribution of Resources Through Three Levels of Government
### Author(s):
- R. G. Cassidy
- M. J. L. Kirby
- W. M. Raike
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model for determining how a central government can most efficiently allocate resources among other levels of government. The model explicitly includes the fact that lower levels of government can make independent decisions once they have been given resources by the central government. A key feature of the model is the mathematical formulation of the central government's objective of distributing resources efficiently, while at the same time being as fair as possible to all those receiving allocations. An algorithm for solving the model is presented along with a numerical example.

## 5. Linear Programming Models for Production-Advertising Decisions
### Author(s):
- Joseph Thomas
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
This paper studies the problem of simultaneously smoothing production and inventory and setting advertising levels. The models given are linear programming models, assuming a deterministic demand-advertising-price relationship. The formulations include both one period and multiperiod models. Advertising has a decreasing effect within each period with a saturation level of advertising included and advertising also has a decreasing effect through time, allowing a build up of a stock of goodwill. A decomposition approach is given which is very efficient computationally due to the simplicity of the subproblems. Other computational aids are discussed; the pricing problem is examined briefly; and a numerical example is given to indicate the possible effect of considering production and advertising (and pricing) decisions together.

## 6. Decomposable Regression Models in the Analysis of Market Potentials
### Author(s):
- Frank M. Bass
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
A regression method for estimating geographic market potentials is developed. Aggregation issues are explored, and a macro model is derived in which it is not necessary to assume that the relationships among variables are the same within the micro subsystems. An estimating procedure is presented and empirically illustrated in which the estimates satisfy additivity and nonnegativity constraints.

## 7. Optimal Maintenance and Sale Age for a Machine Subject to Failure
### Author(s):
- Morton I. Kamien
- Nancy L. Schwartz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
A problem of optimal machine maintenance policy is studied. The value of the machine's output is independent of age, but the natural probability of machine failure increases with age. Preventive maintenance can be applied to reduce the probability of machine failure (but a failed machine can only be junked). The machine may be sold at any time providing it is still effective. The problem is to select an optimal preventive maintenance policy for the period of ownership and a planned sale date at which the machine will be sold providing it has not yet failed.

## 8. A Generalized Goal Decomposition Model
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
A decomposition model is developed which can be interpreted as a representation of decision-making in a three-level hierarchical organization. The central unit coordinates decision activity by generating goals for a subordinate level of management units. These latter are responsible for generating the economic indicators that (1) allow the central unit to evaluate its goal generating policies, and (2) guide the alternative generation activities of third level operating units. Because of the absence of a global objective function for the organization the decision activity is shown to be dependent on the structure of the organization (i.e., the solutions of the model are affected by the structure and degree of decomposition). Thus, unlike existing decomposition models, the model treats organization structure as a variable in the decision-making process. This feature of the model is shown to have implications for organizational design.

## 9. The Information Content of Prices: A Preliminary Model for Estimating Buyer Response
### Author(s):
- Kent B. Monroe
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
An understanding of buyer response to price depends upon determining how buyers perceive price. One hypothesis is buyers have an acceptable range of prices and, therefore, the demand curve is backward bending. This article presents an a priori argument for a new research methodology for estimating buyers' responses to price.

## 10. Optimal Disaggregation of Aggregate Production Plans
### Author(s):
- Klaus Zoller
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1971
### Abstract:
Aggregate Production Planning (APP) is concerned with a minimum cost adaptation of some production process to demand fluctuations, by means of controlling overall production rate (P) and workforce size (W). Disaggregation aims at allocating P and W to individual products such that an optimal sales program is obtained. A technique is developed which may be used for disaggregation when product contributions are nonlinear. It relies on decreasing marginal contributions as an evaluation criterion. In conjunction with an APP model, the technique can be used for a simultaneous derivation of aggregate and disaggregate decisions. This is illustrated by an application to a hypothetical production and sales planning problem.
