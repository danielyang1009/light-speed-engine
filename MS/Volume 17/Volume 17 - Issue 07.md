## 1. Minimax Policies for Selling an Asset and Dollar Averaging
### Author(s):
- Gordon Pye
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
The results of this paper fall into two areas. First, it is shown that the conventional wisdom of dollar averaging is related to hedging against, large regrets rather than unfavorable outcomes. Suppose that a given sum of dollars is to be irreversibly converted into stock within a given number of periods. Suppose that the share price of dollars follows an arithmetic random walk. It is shown that dollar averaging is a nonsequential minimax strategy, if the largest possible price increase in each period is equal to the largest possible decrease. On the other hand, it is shown that dollar averaging cannot be a nonsequential expected utility maximizing strategy for any strictly concave utility function and any arithmetic random walk. Second, sequential minimax strategies are examined. Here the analysis may be viewed as an extension of the literature on the optimal time to sell an asset or the optimal stopping problem. The minimax sequential strategy is shown to be of the following form. At any time there exists a critical value which depends only on n, the difference between the maximum price since conversions began and the current price. Funds held in excess of this value are converted into stock, otherwise no funds are converted. The critical values are shown to be decreasing functions of n. When the share price of dollars rises (i.e., stock prices fall) few funds are converted while decreases produce large conversions. These results seem to correspond to the second thoughts of those, embarking on nonsequential policies of the dollar averaging type. Buying and selling minimax policies are shown to be symmetric. Sequential minimaxing will tend to have a reinforcing effect on price movements.

## 2. A Differential Game in Economics
### Author(s):
- James Case
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
The problem of profit maximization for two firms manufacturing the same commodity is cast as a differential game. The qualitative aspects of the equilibrium point solution of the game are then discussed with the aid of some results on ordinary differential equations.

## 3. On the Optimality of Generalized (s, S) Policies
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
A standard inventory model is examined with a concave increasing ordering cost function rather than simply a linear one with a setup cost. A generalized (s, S) policy is shown to be optimal in the n-period problem. A generalization of k-convex and quasi-convex functions to quasi-k-convex functions is required in the process. The probability densities of demand must be one-sided Pólya densities.

## 4. Optimal Entrepreneurial Decisions in a Completely Stochastic Environment
### Author(s):
- Nils H. Hakansson
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
This paper develops a normative model of the entrepreneur's decision problem in which the following elements are stochastic: the entrepreneur's preferences, his lifetime, the returns from investments, and the process obeyed by the interest rate. Furthermore, the entrepreneur's preferences are assumed to be sensitive to the opportunities facing him at each decision point as well as other environmental factors.

## 5. Transforming Stochastic Dynamic Programming Problems into Nonlinear Programs
### Author(s):
- William T. Ziemba
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
This paper investigates conditions under which stochastic dynamic programs easily reduce to static deterministic programs. The conditions, though strict, are still rich enough to aid in the solution of a number of practical problems.

## 6. Queue Length Dependent Priority Queues
### Author(s):
- K. R. Balachandran
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
Priority rules that are mixtures of pre-emption and postponable rules are analyzed. Whether a pre-emption occurs is made to depend on some factor in addition to priority class. A lower priority customer is pre-empted if and only if the queue length of higher priority customers is N, a decision parameter. The stochastic model (without priorities) is that of the M/G/1 queue. First moment expressions (e.g., expected number of customers in the system) in the steady state case are obtained for each priority class, using the concept of work conservation.

## 7. Smoothing Production by Inventory—An Application of the Wiener Filtering Theory
### Author(s):
- Christoph A. Schneeweiss
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
In many cases it will be possible to separate a production smoothing problem into two parts. One part describes a feedforward production smoothing which may be considered as a “gross regulation.” The other part then smoothes the remaining regulation errors of the first part. This “fine regulation” is performed by an application of the Wiener Newton Theory which allows us to calculate an optimal feedback production policy. It can be shown that if the output of the feedforward part (regulation error) is Gaussian, then the Wiener Newton Theory may be applied even in the case of non-quadratic cost criteria. It is not required that demand in successive time periods be independent, as is usually assumed in the classical approaches working with dynamic programming.

## 8. A Stochastic Model for Adaptive Behavior in a Dynamic Situation
### Author(s):
- J. Morgan Jones
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
A stochastic model of adaptive behavior in a dynamic situation is proposed, and its properties developed. The model is developed from a hypothetical construct of behavior, and, in the limit, becomes a nonstationary probability diffusion process. Although the model has wide potential applicability, it is discussed in the marketing context for which the model was first proposed. In addition to properties of the model, important aspects of the model as it applies to marketing will be discussed.

## 9. Inventory Models with Forecasting and Dependent Demand
### Author(s):
- George F. Brown, Jr.
- Richmond M. Lloyd
- Timothy M. Corcoran
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
In general, the single-product inventory model in which demands in successive periods are not independent is difficult to treat. This paper defines a large class of such problems, when there is a positive lead time for delivery, which can be treated by the classical formulation with a single state variable. All results which hold for inventory models with a constant delivery lag can be shown to hold also for this model. An application is made to a system in which demands are generated by part failure and in which a portion of these failures are repaired after a given (constant or probabilistic) time.

## 10. Comment on Briskin's Note
### Author(s):
- Gene Woolsey
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1971
### Abstract:
Recently, in a note by Lawrence E. Briskin [Briskin, Lawrence E. 1970. A note on Trauth and Woolsey's integer programming article. Management Sci.16(11, July) 651.], it was pointed out that LIP1, an integer programming code, gave a wrong answer. I have now accumulated some years of bitter experience in attempting to solve several hundred integer programming problems with an ever increasing set of algorithms. I am therefore prepared to state that a wrong answer should hardly surprise anyone who has done much computational work in integer programming.
