## 1. Compensation of School District Personnel
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Recently considerable attention has been focused on the inadequacy of presently used methods of compensating school district personnel. The increasing incidence of teacher strikes in many school districts has established the need for an effective alternative to the inherent rigidity of the commonly used fixed step salary schedule. The purpose of this study is to propose one such alternative that is based upon mathematical programming techniques. In this study a salary evaluation model was derived then applied to a school district. Salary schedules were derived which (1) were consistent with both the imposed hierarchical and budgetary constraints, (2) considered ten factors in the salary evaluation, and (3) reflected established school district priorities and objectives. This latter feature was accomplished by solving the model with various objective functions.

## 2. A Process Analysis Model of the U.S. Steel Industry

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
In this paper a process analysis model of production in the U.S. Steel Industry is developed and tested. A technology matrix, which represents recent industry input-output structure, is estimated using engineering and metallurgical information. This matrix together with detailed cost, sales and resource capacity data is then used in a linear programming model of short-run resource allocation for the industry as a whole. Linear programming solutions are obtained and compared with available industry statistics for each year in the period 1955–1968. Theil's U statistic is computed to indicate how well the model performs. We conclude that it performs “fairly well” and that it should prove useful in various economic applications.

## 3. Application of Linear Programming to a Controversy on Air Pollution Control
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Kohn
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
A linear programming model for air pollution abatement is presented. It is based on the simplifying assumption that air quality goals may be expressed as maximum allowable emission flows in an airshed. The solution of the model for the St. Louis Airshed is examined to evaluate certain charges that it is economically infeasible for purposes of air pollution control to impose restrictions on the sulfur content of coal. It is found that such a regulation is justified for certain types of stokers but not others, that furnaces with a heating efficiency of 75% or less should be converted to natural gas. Uncertainty over certain key parameters precludes judgment as to whether the use of low sulfur coal is optimal for pulverized coal furnaces.

## 4. Problem Solving with Ordinal Measurement
### Author(s):
- Edwin M. Bartee
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
Modern socio-political-economic problems often represent situations in which the traditional numerical problem models fall far short of being adequate for determining formal solutions. The basic reason for this inadequacy is the fact that the objective functions in such problems contain abstract criteria. It, therefore, is difficult, if not impossible, to determine how much one alternative in the problem is preferred to another alternative. When such information is not available in a problem, a numerical model will serve to fabricate this information and, therefore, reduce the degree of isomorphism between the problem and the problem model.

## 5. A Communication Model of Dialectical Inquiring Systems—A Strategy for Strategic Planning
### Author(s):
- Ian I. Mitroff
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
Using Bayesian probability theory and Ackoff's Behayorial Theory of Communication, a mathematical model of the Hegelian Dialectical Inquirer is developed. The model strongly argues against the widely held and naive distinction between “fact” and “theory.” The model strongly argues for a new way of treating statistical data, in a sense, for a “new” theory of statistics. A fundamental principle of the Hegelian Inquirer is formalized, i.e., that one only stands to understand any issue by witnessing the strongest possible kind of debate take place on that issue. The model suggested is one that is seen as especially suited to issues involved in Strategic Planning.

## 6. Behavioral Externalities in Decentralized Organizations
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
A number of analytic formulations of resource allocation activities in decentralized organizations have considered the effects of economic or technological externalities but most treatments have neglected concomitant organizational or behavioral effects. This paper introduces the concept of a behavioral externality and relates it to the decision-making process in decentralized organizations. Alternative analytic formulations of behavioral externalities are examined, and a numerical example is presented.

## 7. Information Systems and Public Planning
### Author(s):
- Ida R. Hoos
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
Persuaded that management information systems will help them achieve efficiency of operation and attain organizational goals, public planners, like those in the private sector, are eagerly embarking on ambitious feasibility studies and contracting for elaborate hardware and software systems. Since this effort is being undertaken in the service of the public, it is important to assess the social costs and benefits.

## 8. A Suggested Behavioral Approach to Cost-Benefit Analysis
### Author(s):
- Leo Spier
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
Whenever problems arise from differences of opinion, there probably exists a lack of understanding of the behavioral situations that contributed to the problems. In his interaction with others, man passes from a level of ignorance to one of awareness and seldom reaches a level of understanding. Without that understanding, however, there is no common premise for resolving problems either with regard to methods or results. Today's executive faces issues that deal not only with the familiar technical business decisions but, more significantly, with related labor, social and environmental responsibilities, and political implications both at home and abroad. Consequently, he must be equipped with the essential tools for analysis of complex behavioral interactions as a requisite to effective application of quantitative techniques.

## 9. A Probability Model for the Remission Rate of Discharged Psychiatric Patients
### Author(s):
- Peter D. Fox
- Helena C. Kraemer
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1971
### Abstract:
A model of a type previously used in describing intervals between industrial accidents and between consumer purchases of a product is suggested to describe psychiatric patient rehospitalization times. Two forms of the model are discussed, and estimation procedures for the parameters of each of the two forms are described. The use of the models is illustrated by applying these estimation techniques to a set of data.
