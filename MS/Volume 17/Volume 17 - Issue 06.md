## 1. Management Information Systems: The Challenge to Rationality and Emotionality
### Author(s):
- Chris Argyris
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
If management information systems achieve their designers' highest levels of aspiration, they will tend to create conditions where executives will experience (1) reduction of space of free movement, (2) psychological failure and double bind, (3) leadership based more on competence than formal power, and (4) decreased feelings of essentiality. These experiences will tend to create genuine resistance to MIS. MIS specialists, in turn, are not presently equipped to cope with the emotional problems caused by their systems. They react over rationally, which is an emotional response, and have difficulty in coping with their own and the executives' feelings and behavior.

## 2. Considering Competition in Media Planning
### Author(s):
- Leonard M. Lodish
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
A normative mathematical procedure for the media planning problem is proposed which explicitly considers the effect of competitors' media schedules. A predictive model is developed to evaluate expected market response due to an advertising media schedule considering the anticipated schedules of competitors as well as other major advertising phenomena. Heuristic search routines are used to select and schedule media with the objective of maximizing market response subject to budget limitations. The procedure has been applied on real problems.

## 3. Dimensional and Computational Analysis in Stationary (s, S) Inventory Problems with Gamma Distributed Demand
### Author(s):
- B. D. Sivazlian
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
In the stationary periodic review (s, S) inventory system with stationary demand and immediate delivery of orders, the optimal values of s and S, say s* and S*, will be a function of the input parameters defining the cost structure and the demand distribution. Assume backlogging is allowed and let the fixed order cost be K, the unit holding cost be h, and the unit penalty cost be p. Further, assume the demand per period to have a gamma distribution of order r and with parameter μ. A dimensional analysis of the basic equations dictating the optimal values s* and Q* = S* − s* shows that it is possible to express the quantities μs* and μQ* as a function of the three factors p/h, 2Kμ/h, and r. This reduces the number of input parameters from five to three and enables one to compute values of μs* and μQ* for a range of values of the three input factors. A selected set of graphs is presented allowing one to read the optimal values for given input parameters.

## 4. On the Methodology of Solution Synthesis
### Author(s):
- Edwin M. Bartee
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
The persistence of many old problems suggests that our unilateral approaches to solutions are inadequate. A change in outlook has been fostered by the systems viewpoint, resulting in a movement toward a more creative formulation of systems and a dissolution of disciplinary boundaries, The systems approach is open-ended, however, and does not have the perspective that is necessary for developing meaningful solutions for complex problems. We must concern ourselves with the elements of synthesis that would close the problem loop, that is, a methodology of solution synthesis. A theory of solution synthesis is developed within the context of social behavior. Many of the concepts utilized in the development of this theory were drawn from the knowledge attributed to general systems theory. A formal phenomenological theory for solution synthesis is presented as eight propositions with inference into a social context. The application of the theory for solution synthesis is illustrated through the development of a plan for urban citizen participation.

## 5. Work Sampling in Financial Management—Cost Determination in Post Office Department
### Author(s):
- B. J. Mandel
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
Work Sampling has been described by some authorities as the best and most objective method of measuring the time and cost of performing the various functions of complex organizations for use in management, budgeting and setting performance standards. Yet its use for these purposes has been quite limited. This paper is designed to encourage further use of Work Sampling. It describes what is probably the largest continuing application of Work Sampling in the world, namely, that made by the Post Office Department. About 4.5 million observations are made during a year at randomly selected instants of time to estimate the cost of the in-office activities and over 200,000 employees participate each year.

## 8. A Control Approach to Insurance Loss Reserving
### Author(s):
- William K. King
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
Most casualty insurance loss reserving has been performed on a “case basis” without regard to the causal factors which affect losses—accident frequency, accident severity, and the firm's exposure to claims. Here, a control approach is developed which permits the loss reserve decision-maker to establish loss reserves on the basis of these indicators of the current loss environment.

## 9. Using Laboratory Brand Preference Scales to Predict Consumer Brand Purchases
### Author(s):

- Richard Teach
- Douglas Tigert
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
Laboratory measures of brand preferences and survey measures of demographic, media exposure, attitudinal, activity and opinion characteristics of individual consumers have been combined to predict brand purchases in the market. Brands in the tooth paste, liquid household cleaner and cake mix product categories were employed in a set of laboratory experiments. Preference scales derived from the experiments are used in three separate models to predict the subject's purchases recorded in seven months of diary data. The behavioral implications and predictive power of the models are interesting from both theoretical and applied points of view.

## 10. An Alternative to Uniform Expenditure Reductions in Multiple Resource State Finance Programs
### Author(s):
- James E. Bruno
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate an alternative procedure for reducing state expenditures in ongoing state programs without resulting in the major description commonly associated with uniform or across-the-board state budget cuts. Using, for purposes of illustration only, a problem involving the reduction in state expenditures for a school finance program, a linear programming model was derived—then applied. The purpose or objective of the model was to determine the required state resource allocation strategy which would minimize the state's financial commitment (however it may be defined by educators and legislators) without seriously affecting the financial support for educational expenditures at the school district level. In the state finance program studied, the total state expenditure could have been reduced by over one million dollars with no reduction in the state guaranteed minimum level of expenditure (referred to as the foundation level) per ADA (student in average daily attendance). Peripheral benefits such as a large amount of property tax relief, more state aid to districts with a poor tax base, and a decrease in the dollar spread in per pupil expenditures between districts were also achieved. The results of the study indicate possibilities for utilizing linear programming or similar methods for other state resource allocation problems involving revenues from federal, state or local sources.

## 11. A Marginal Cost Model for the Hiring-Overtime Decision
### Author(s):
- Earl F. Lundgren
- V. Schneider
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1971
### Abstract:
In the case where a given demand increase over a finite time span is known and exceeds current production capacities, a marginal cost analysis can provide decision criteria for work-force adjustments. Using the marginal costs of hiring new workers and for various periods of overtime as a basis, decisions can be made to hire new workers, to work overtime, or to do both. The marginal cost analysis for hiring new workers includes the application of learning curve data to their increasing productivity rate over the time span. The approach minimizes costs, assuming it is not necessary to buy new equipment or add supervisors. The greatest applicability for the model may be found in certain job shop situations.
