## 1. Ordinal Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Matthew J. Sobel
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
Numerically valued reward processes are found in most dynamic programming models. Mitten, however, recently formulated finite horizon sequential decision processes in which a real-valued reward need not be earned at each stage. Instead of the cardinality assumption implicit in past models, Mitten assumes that a decision maker has a preference order over a general collection of outcomes (which need not be numerically valued). This paper investigates infinite horizon ordinal dynamic programming models. Both deterministic and stochastic models are considered. It is shown that an optimal policy exists if and only if some stationary policy is optimal. Moreover, “policy improvement” leads to better policies using either Howard-Blackwell or Eaton-Zadeh procedures. The results illuminate the roles played by various sets of assumptions in the literature on Markovian decision processes.

## 2. Optimal Control of Sales Force Effort in Time
### Author(s):
- Charles S. Tapiero
- John U. Farley
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
This paper examines the temporal effects of alternative procedures for controlling sales force effort, particularly when the effect of such effort is felt in both current and future periods. Related informational requirements for both firm and salesmen are also discussed in terms of nonzero sum differential games, and implications for the temporal management of selling effort are derived.

## 3. The Warehouse Location Formulation as a Special Type of Inspection Problem
### Author(s):
- R. R. Trippi
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
This note presents a model for allocation of inspection resources to points within a discrete manufacturing process at minimum cost. An integer programming formulation is developed having identical structure to a warehouse (factory) location problem which has been the focus of a number of investigations.

## 4. Sequencing Two-Machine Flow-Shops with Finite Intermediate Storage
### Author(s):
- Sujit K. Dutta
- Andrew A. Cunningham
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
The deterministic N-job two-machine flow-shop sequencing problem with finite intermediate storage is considered with the objective of minimizing the total processing time. A dynamic programming procedure is presented whereby an optimal solution to the problem may be obtained. Since the storage and computation time requirements for the solution of this model are large, it is modified so as to give a suboptimal recursive procedure which yields good solutions with much less computational effort. A further approximate method based on the technique of successive approximations is shown to provide an alternative means for tackling large problems. In addition, several new results are derived for the particular case where the buffer capacity is zero.

## 5. Optimal Allocation of Resources in a Pari-Mutuel Setting
### Author(s):
- Bernard Rosner
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
This article deals with an optimal algorithm for wagering in a pari-mutuel situation given that one is a perfect handicapper. A general rule is given for all pari-mutuel events with mutually exclusive outcomes. The rule has several surprising aspects which differ considerably from previous betting rules. The rule is useful when one's own bet is small relative to the total amount bet by the public. The optimality criterion is that of maximizing the expected log return.

## 6. A Deterministic Multi-Period Production Planning Model with Piecewise Concave Production and Holding-Backorder Costs
### Author(s):
- Cary Swoveland
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
A single product, finite horizon production planning model with known requirements is considered. Production and holding-backorder cost functions are assumed to be piecewise concave, thereby allowing an arbitrarily close approximation to a wide range of cost functions which one might encounter in practice. In each period production, inventories and backlogged orders may not exceed prescribed levels.

## 7. A Node Method for Multiparametric Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- C. Van De Panne
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
A method is presented for the generation of extreme points of regions in the parameter space for which a certain basic solution is optimal. It is shown that for any extreme point the inequalities which determine the adjacent regions are easily generated. A numerical example is worked out in detail.

## 8. Multi-Item Production Smoothing Models with Almost Closed Form Solutions
### Author(s):
- Ulf Peter Welam
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
Computational efficiency in solving large-scale multi-item production smoothing models with quadratic costs is the chief concern of this paper. We consider two multi-item versions of the HMMS model and show that their optimal solutions can be obtained in “almost” closed form. Numerical inversion of large matrices is therefore not necessary and considerable savings in terms of storage requirements are also possible. The existence of unique optimal solutions depends in a very simple way on the model parameters.

## 9. Hierarchical Decomposition in Linear Economic Models
### Author(s):
- Finn Kydland
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
In decomposed linear programming models it is generally not possible to decentralize by prices alone. The Dantzig-Wolfe procedure, for instance, delegates weights on basic solutions in addition to the equilibrium prices. In this paper we present a decomposition procedure for linear models where we in addition to prices delegate a hierarchical ordering. In many problems this ordering makes the assignment of weights unnecessary, and gives the divisions more autonomy in their decision making. An operational condition is found for determining if, for any given problem, the new decomposition procedure will achieve coherent decentralization.

## 10. A Graph Theoretic Formula for the Steady State Distribution of Finite Markov Processes
### Author(s):
- James J. Solberg
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
This paper presents a formula which expresses the solution to the steady-state equations of a finite irreducible Markov process in terms of subgraphs of the transition diagram of the process. The formula is similar in spirit to well-known flowgraph formulas, but possesses several unique advantages. The formula is the same whether the process is discrete or continuous in time; it is efficient in the sense that no cancellation of terms can occur (it is a simple sum of positive terms); and it is both conceptually and computationally simple. Because these advantages are gained by exploiting properties of Markov processes, the formula is not applicable to linear equations in general, as are the flowgraph methods. The paper states and proves the theorem for both the discrete and continuous cases, gives examples of each, and cites computational experience with the formula.

## 11. Relevant Policies for Markovian Queueing Systems with Many Types of Service
### Author(s):
- Avraham Beja
- Ariela Teller
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
A single station service system with bounded queue capacity operates in discrete time, and at each period, one out of K possible service rates is used. A subclass of the stationary nonrandomized policies—termed relevant—which uses only a subset of the available service rates, is proved optimal for the average cost criterion. If there is some type of service whereby the expected cost per served customer is no more than the expense of losing him, the service rate in all relevant policies increases with the number of customers observed in the system; if there is no such type of service, the service rate in all relevant policies decreases with the number of observed customers.

## 12. A Multiproduct Inventory System with Interactive Set-Up Costs
### Author(s):
- Fred Andres
- Hamilton Emmons
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
We present a branch and bound algorithm for finding the optimal ordering policy for a multiproduct inventory system with deterministic demand, infinite horizon, and no backlogging. Ordering costs are assumed to include a separate set-up cost for each product ordered, but with a fixed savings each time all products are simultaneously ordered. Holding costs accrue at a constant rate per unit of each product.

## 13. Sequencing for Assembly Lines with Integer Task Times
### Author(s):
- William V. Gehrlein
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
Two heuristic assembly line balancing procedures (the precedence matrix, enumeration method of Hoffman [Hoffman, Thomas R. 1963. Assembly line balancing with a precedence matrix. Management Sci.9 (4, July).] and the biased sampling procedure of Arcus [Arcus, Alpert L. 1966. COMSOAL: A computer method for sequencing operations for assembly lines. E. S. Buffa, ed. Readings in Production and Operations Management. John Wiley, New York.]) are compared on the balances obtained and the computation time required to solve ALB problems. The use of Hoffman's technique with integer task times and a modified trial cycle time selection generally produces improved balances in less computation time for the problems examined. A modification to Hoffman's procedure for smoothing balance delay is also reported.

## 14. Note—Optimal Heuristic Decisions for the s, S Inventory Policy
### Author(s):
- Eliezer Naddor
### Published:
- 1 May 1975
### Abstract:
Heuristic decision rules for the s, S policy in probabilistic inventory systems are proposed. The rules require only the knowledge of the mean and standard deviation of demand, probability of no demand, carrying and replenishing costs, desired availability, and leadtime. Numerical results are given to illustrate the application of the rules.
