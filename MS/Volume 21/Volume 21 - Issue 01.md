## 1. The Incorporation and Reduction of Value Judgements in Systems
### Author(s):
- Richard Mattessich
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
This paper first examines and illustrates the way in which value judgements can be incorporated in a system, and how they can be externalized by changing the system's boundaries. Then some general statements about value judgements and their locations in systems are advanced. The acceptance of these statements enables an extension of the notion of “value judgement” from sentences to systems. Thus criteria are spelled out for attributing the terms “normative” and “positive” to systems. Then the changes are examined which occur when a system undergoes the transfer of a value judgement from its structure to its (external) environment. Furthermore an attempt is made to clarify (by means of this Method of Neutralizing Systems) the longstanding controversy of value neutrality of science and of our own discipline. Finally an analysis is sketched which reveals that the assertion “ought-to-sentences cannot be reduced to is-sentences” need not be tautological if it is meant to hold within a system only. If the pertinent normative remnant lies beyond the system boundaries, a value judgement can indeed be reduced to a factual statement, but merely within this system.

## 2. On Rutenberg's Decomposition Method
### Author(s):
- Wei Shen Hsia
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
David P. Rutenberg [Rutenberg, David P. 1970. Generalized networks, generalized upper bounding and decomposition of the convex simplex methods. Management Sci.16 (5) 388–401.] provided a method to solve separable nonlinear objective functions with large-scale linear constraints by using W. I. Zangwill's Convex Simplex Method [Zangwill, W. L. 1967. The convex simplex method. Management Sci.14 (3) 221–238.] However, there seem to be several errors in §4.3 [Rutenberg, David P. 1970. Generalized networks, generalized upper bounding and decomposition of the convex simplex methods. Management Sci.16 (5) 397]. Two counterexamples to his conclusions are given in this paper. A revised definition of subproblem, therefore, an optimal criterion of the large-scaled program, is also given.

## 3. A Sequential Algorithm for a Class of Programming Problems with Nonlinear Constraints
### Author(s):
- R. Jagannathan
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to furnish a computational scheme for a class of programming problems with nonlinear constraints. The algorithm is sequential in nature, producing a sequence of feasible solutions whose limit points are optimal solutions of the original problem. Further, with a view to accelerating convergence we suggest two variants of the solution procedure.

## 4. The Dual of a Hyperbolic Approximation to the Generalized Constrained Multi-Facility Location Problem with lp, Distances
### Author(s):
- Robert F. Love
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
This article develops the dual program corresponding to a hyperbolic approximation, of the constrained multi-facility location model using lp distances. The dual program is original and is a contribution to the theory of facilities location as well as providing a new efficient method of computing optimal facilities location in certain cases where linear constraints are present. Some properties of the dual are developed as the hyperbolic approximation model converges to the actual location model. Computation results using a decomposition programming method are given and discussed.

## 5. A Production Scheduling Problem with Sequencing Considerations
### Author(s):
- T. Prabhakar
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
A type of production scheduling problem with sequencing considerations existing in several manufacturing facilities in chemical industry is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem and solved using a branch and bound search algorithm. The problem has two unusual sequencing aspects, namely, (1) a product to be sequenced can be split up amongst the reactors which, described in sequencing literature as job-splitting, is not usually allowed in machine sequencing problems and (2) the number of products to be sequenced on a given equipment as well as the product sequence need to be simultaneously determined. Some computational experience is reported.

## 6. Preference Order Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- L. G. Mitten
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
The dynamic programming recursive procedure has provided an efficient method for solving a variety of multi-stage decision problems in which the objective is measured by a real valued utility function. In this paper we propose that the real valued objective function be replaced by preference relations. Sufficient conditions are given on the structure of the preference relations to insure that the recursive dynamic programming procedure yields an optimal sequence of decisions.

## 7. A Linear Programming Analogue, a Duality Theorem, and a Dynamic Algorithm
### Author(s):
- D. J. White
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
This paper considers fluid analogues for the standard linear programming problem and for a separable nonlinear programming problem. In the former case the usual duality results are demonstrated using the principle of minimum potential energy. In addition by examining the dynamics of the system a new method, referred to as the R-method, is derived for solving linear programmes, although it is not demonstrated that this has any computational advantages over the standard simplex method, except that degeneracy causes no problems. In the nonlinear case the weak Lagrangian principle is derived.

## 8. Optimal Sequential Assignments with Random Arrival Times
### Author(s):
- S. Christian Albright
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
A problem is considered where jobs arrive at random times and assume random values, or importance. These must be assigned to a fixed set of men whose qualities are different but known. As each job arrives, its value is observed and the decision-maker must decide which man, if any, to assign to this job. If a job arrives at time t and its value is observed to be x, then by assigning man i with quality pi, a reward r(t)pix is received, where r(t) is a discount function. The object is to find an assignment policy which maximizes the expected reward from the available men. The problem is analyzed for different arrival distributions and for different discount functions, but in all cases, the optimal policies are shown to have fairly simple forms, independent of the actual qualities of the men, the pi's. Other interpretations of the model, besides the men and jobs interpretation, are also given. The paper concludes with a similar model which does not, however, include time as an explicit parameter.

## 9. Job Shop Scheduling with Due Dates and Overtime Capability
### Author(s):
- C. A. Holloway
- R. T. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
A scheduling procedure is proposed for the static job shop problem with job due dates and overtime capability. An example is used to demonstrate the procedure and the generation of trade-off curves relating overtime and total tardiness for use in managerial evaluation of alternative schedules. Results are reported for a set of trial problems having 30 to 98 processing operations. An extension of the procedure is described for dynamic job shop scheduling.

## 10. The Evaluation of Risky Investments with Random Timing of Cash Returns
### Author(s):
- Stylianos Perrakis
- Claude Henin
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
This paper provides a computational technique for the evaluation of the distribution of the net present value (NPV) of an investment, in which the cash inflows occur at random time points, as in the case of venture capital. The initial cash outlay is deterministic and the magnitudes of the cash inflows are nonnegative, random variables with known distributions. The lengths of the intervals between successive cash inflows are independently distributed and independent of the magnitude of the inflows. The Laplace transforms and the first two moments of the distribution are computed for both independent and perfectly correlated inflows. It is shown that the use of constant time intervals when the timing of the inflows is random underestimates the variance of the distribution of the NPV.

## 12. Individual Decisions Concerning the Allocation of Resources for Projects with Uncertain Consequences
### Author(s):
- Claus C. Berg
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
Individual decision making behavior under uncertainty is queried by experiments. The subject's task is to allocate resources for projects with transformation results about which only uncertain expectations exist. The purpose is to get some insight into the information processing which determines the choice of an allocation rate. The data contradict any predictions based on a SEU model of decision making behavior under uncertainty. An heuristic information processing model is built which possesses better empirical validity than the SEU model. The model provides an alternative to Atkinson's theory, for it is demonstrated that individuals show both typical and atypical reactions in dynamic interaction. The variable ‘situation of an individual’ is defined which provides a mechanism to explain the observable switch in the priority ordering of needs.

## 13. A Note on Hierarchy and Coordination: An Aspect of Decentralization
### Author(s):
- Manfred Kochen
- Karl W. Deutsch
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1974
### Abstract:
A mathematical expression for the cost of maintaining a client-centered service organisation is derived. It shows the dependency of the total cost on the service-request load, the number of hierarchical levels of the organization, and the administrative costs. The mathematical formulation is based on a model in which the main variables are the times spent on communication between different levels of the organisation and on communication between agents at the same level. The optimum number of levels for minimising cost is derived, and its sentivity to request load is investigated.
