## 1. The Stochastic Cash Balance Problem with Average Compensating-Balance Requirements
### Author(s):
- Warren H. Hausman
- Antonio Sanchez-Bell
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of managing two assets, cash and an earning asset, when net cash flows are stochastic and when there are transfer costs for transferring assets from one form to the other. Previous work on the stochastic cash-balance problem has assumed holding costs for holding excess cash and penalty costs for holding insufficient cash, with these costs assessed per period (the same period in which there is a single decision or transfer opportunity and a single random cash flow). This formulation is appropriate when a firm faces minimum (or zero) compensating-balance requirements, but not when the compensating-balance requirement involves an average deposit balance over a number of decision periods. A dynamic programming model is presented which appropriately represents the relevant cost function for a firm facing an average compensating-balance requirement. The dynamic programming solution to a numerical example is compared to that of a static two-sided (s, S) policy; the optimal dynamic programming solution represents an 18% reduction in relevant costs in the example.

## 2. Perceptor: A Model for Product Positioning
### Author(s):
- Glen L. Urban
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
A model and measurement methodology is proposed to aid managers in designing new frequently purchased consumer products. The model is structured as a trial and repeat process that produces an estimate of long-run share for a new brand. Physical and psychological product attributes are linked to the trial and repeat probabilities through multidimensional scaling procedures. Perceptual maps of existing brands with ideal brand positionings are derived. The product design determines the new brand's position in the perceptual space, and the distance from the new brand to the ideal brand specifies its probability of purchase.

## 3. Effective Performance Behaviors in a Simulated Policy and Decision Making Environment
### Author(s):
- Joseph Wolfe
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
Management games and teaching simulations have obtained widespread adoption in business schools and management development programs. While a number of summary evaluations have demonstrated the efficacy of the management game as a learning environment, little is known about what behavior players exercise within the game situation. Using the critical incident technique, the author collected 1,453 behavior citations of effective and ineffective performance by 211 students playing one of two different management games. The reported behaviors fell into seven broad performance groupings covering the students' pregame preparation, their company's personality and operating characteristics, Board meeting atmosphere and interpersonal climate, the team's use of forecasting, analytical, and planning techniques, and their decision making mechanics. It was found that the management games rewarded rational policy and decision making practices and that chance played no consistent part in company success. As a teaching device, the management game appears to provide many of the elements needed for education in business policy and decision making.

## 5. Stochastic Models of a Price Promotion
### Author(s):
- Yoram Kinberg
- Ambar G. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
Stochastic models of a commonly used consumer marketing tool—a price off or price promotion—are developed. Two cases are considered: first, when the duration of the promotion is unknown to customers, and second, when it is known. The optimal duration is derived in both cases as a function of the probability of purchasers of competitive brands switching to the promoted brand, the increased quantity purchased due to the “bargain” and the possible increase in the consumption rate as a consequence. A numerical illustration and a discussion of promotion desirability at different times is presented. Finally, a procedure for estimating model parameters and testing model assumptions is discussed.

## 6. Performance and the Use of an Information System
### Author(s):
- Henry C. Lucas, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to explore the contributions of information systems to the organization. A descriptive model is presented which identifies (1) expected predictors of performance and the use of an information system and (2) the relationship between the use of a system and performance. The results of a study of sales force performance and the use of a sales information system are presented to provide empirical evidence to support the model. The results confirm the general relationships among classes of variables in the model, but specific relations among variables are complex and depend heavily on the environment of the organization.

## 7. Television and Efficiency in Higher Education
### Author(s):
- Dean T. Jamison
- Keith G. Lumsden
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
ITV has long been heralded as providing the potential for substantial improvements in the quality, or reductions in the cost, of higher education. Yet there exist no analytical models that would allow a quantitative expression of the extent to which ITV could, in fact, improve educational efficiency. Our purpose in this paper has been to develop such a model. The model is developed in terms of efficiency improvement in a 2 year professional school; it generalizes readily, however, to any institution of higher learning that has a substantial number of multi-section courses.

## 8. Resource Planning for Randomly Arriving Stochastic Jobs
### Author(s):
- Norman R. Lyons
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for planning resources across a finite time horizon when the demands on resources arrive in a Poisson fashion and are stochastic. The approach used is a chance-constrained programming model whose parameters are estimated using an Edgeworth approximation technique.

## 9. An Optimal Commission Plan for Salesmen's Control Over Price
### Author(s):
- Charles B. Weinberg
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
If marginal costs are constant, salesman who are paid a commission based on gross margin and who are given control over price will set prices so as to maximize simultaneously their own income and the company's profits. The result holds even if a salesman can only make a probabilistic estimate of sales.

## 10. A Comparison of Heuristic and Optimum Solutions in Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Edward W. Davis
- James H. Patterson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
The problem addressed is that of scheduling the activities of a project network to minimize project duration under conditions of multiple limited resource requirements and availabilities. Various heuristic sequencing rules have been applied to this problem, and the effectiveness of these rules relative to one another has been previously compared in the literature. However, there have been no previous comparisons of the effectiveness of these rules relative to an optimum solution. This paper makes such a comparison of eight different heuristic scheduling rules, including those found most effective in previous research on this problem. Results are presented for a total of eighty-three different multi-resource problems.

## 11. The Science-Technology-Utilization Relationship in Management
### Author(s):
- William H. Gruber
- John S. Niles
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1975
### Abstract:
The transfer of management science into management practice is examined. Starting with the TIMS definition of management science, we delineate three fundamental classes of activity and associated personnel: (1) management science and scientists, (2) management technology and technologists, (3) management practice and managers. The inter-group communication flows which are necessary for the transfer of management science into management practice are then developed.
