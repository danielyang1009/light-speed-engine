## 1. Mathematical Models for Optimal Timing of Drilling on Multilayer Oil and Gas Fields
### Author(s):
- Djangir A. Babayev
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
The following problem of optimal control of multilayer gas and oil fields is formulated: for a given planning horizon find an optimal number of wells to be drilled on each layer and to be transferred between layers as a function of time to meet technological constraints and requirements, and to provide minimum total reduced cost per unit output. The optimal control problem is presented in the form of a mathematical programming problem with a nonlinear fractional objective function containing separable concave functions, and with separable concave constraints. Constraints describing specific features of gas and oil fields are considered. Solution procedures and applications are discussed.

## 2. Economic Optimization of Offshore Petroleum Development
### Author(s):
- Les Frair
- Mike Devine
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
Due to shortages in crude oil supplies there is considerable motivation to develop the vast petroleum resources located on our outer continental shelf. Offshore oil operations require great outlays of capital, and this paper presents a model and solution procedure for optimizing the economics of developing a given offshore field. The model considers the following variables: (1) How many offshore drilling platforms are needed? (2) How many wells should be drilled from each platform? (3) What is the location of each platform? (4) From which platform should each well be drilled? (5) What are the time schedules for placing the platforms and drilling the wells? (6) What is the production schedule for each reservoir?

## 3. The Costs of Industrial Product Innovations
### Author(s):
- Edwin Mansfield
- John Rapoport
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
To help shed new light on the factors associated with the large differences among innovations in the percent of innovation costs devoted to R and D, detailed data were obtained concerning a sample of chemical innovations. A simple econometric model was used to test a number of tentative hypotheses advanced to help explain these differences. The model can explain about half of the observed variation.

## 4. Comparative Evaluation of Some Interactive Approaches to Multicriterion Optimization
### Author(s):
- Jyrki Wallenius
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes the results of a laboratory experiment the purpose of which was to compare from a human decision-maker's point of view the performance of the interactive methods for multicriterion optimization recently developed by Geoffrion and Benayoun et al. (STEP-method), and a simple trial-and-error procedure for solving the multiple criteria problem. All the methods were tested on a time-sharing system using as subjects both business school students and managers recruited from industry. The experimental context chosen is a problem of planning production, inventory and labour for a fictitious company.

## 5. On Optimal Pollution Control Policies
### Author(s):
- Vijay S. Bawa
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
In recent years, on the basis of static allocative efficiency properties economists have advocated the use of taxation as an economically efficient means of control to implement environmental protection policy. Environmental problems, however, do not always develop smoothly and gradually but are often characterized by infrequent serious crises that require rapid, but temporary, changes in the controlling mechanism. Tax policy is inappropriate for such crises, but direct controls can be implemented rapidly to handle such emergencies. Using simple stochastic models to represent the physical environment, we show that the pollution control policy which minimizes total social costs (stationary social costs plus short-term emergency costs) is a mixed policy in which taxes are used to control the long-run equilibrium level of pollution and direct controls are used in short-term emergencies to maintain the pollution at satisfactory level. We also show that although tax policy alone is not optimal, in some special circumstances, direct controls alone may be the optimal way to control pollution.

## 6. Analyzing Multi-Commodity Distribution Networks Having Milling-in-Transit Features
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Markland
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
This paper summarizes the development and implementation of a model which uses the transportation method of linear programming to analyze multi-commodity networks having milling-in-transit features. The milling-in-transit privilege, which is granted by common carriers on many bulk raw materials, functionally relates the inbound raw materials with the outbound finished goods produced at a given manufacturing facility. The proposed model is developed under general assumptions, and is used to determine raw material sources and associated purchasing quantities, and to apply transit billing to outbound end product shipments. Implementation and utilization of the model by a major American food processor is described, and results from the model's application are presented and discussed.

## 7. A Simplified Algorithm for Obtaining Approximate Solutions to Zero-One Programming Problems
### Author(s):
- Yoshiaki Toyoda
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
This paper is intended to present a simple and quick method for obtaining approximate solutions to large scale zero-one programming problems. The method does not use enumeration. Instead, it assigns measures of preferability to zero-one variables that change the values of the variables from zero to one. The method yields very good approximate solutions to zero-one programming problems in dramatically short computation time. Even for problems involving more than a thousand zero-one variables the computation time is of little concern. The method is applicable not only to those problems associated with obtaining the optimal package of variables with the value one but also to a great variety of binary choice (“Yes-No”) problems.

## 8. Investment Analysis Using the Probability Distribution of the Internal Rate of Return
### Author(s):
- William Fairley
- Henry D. Jacoby
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
The probability distribution of the internal rate of return of an investment is derived under conditions where uncertainty in costs and returns can be described by a multi-variate normal distribution. The paper sketches the derivation of the exact probability distribution for the rate of return and gives the normal approximation to this distribution when variances of period costs and returns are small. A number of typical normal probability models are discussed in order to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach. An extended application of the analysis is presented using a World Bank appraisal of a hydroelectric power investment in Argentina.

## 9. Stochastic Dominance Tests for Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion. I. Discrete Random Variables
### Author(s):
- R. G. Vickson
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
Stochastic dominance (SD) theory is concerned with orderings of random variables by classes of utility functions characterized solely in terms of general properties. This paper discusses a type of stochastic dominance, called DSD, which is denned by the utility functions having decreasing absolute risk-aversion. Necessary and sufficient conditions for DSD are presented for discrete random variables which, after the possible addition of points of zero probability, are concentrated on finitely many equally-spaced points. The problem is cast as a nonlinear program, which is solved through an efficient dynamic programming routine. Examples are presented to illustrate the increased effectiveness of DSD relative to previous types of stochastic dominance.

## 10. A Model for Manpower Management
### Author(s):
- Gary L. Lilien
- Ambar G. Rao
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
A model for manpower management is presented based upon the study of a large technical department of a corporation. The model can be used in an optimization mode to determine recruiting plans, given manning needs, and in a simulation mode to project the results of changes in salary structure or advancement policies. The model explicitly recognizes different levels of performance at each job level, and the fact that certain sources of employees are more likely to produce “better” employees than others. Also modelled is the phenomenon of the “learning period”—the time it takes for a person to approach his potential in a given job. Several numerical examples of the use of the model based on observed data are presented.

## 11. Planning for Computer Networks: The Trade Analogy
### Author(s):
- Sanford V. Berg
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
This paper shows how the theory of international trade provides a useful framework for examining policy issues confronting educational resource sharing networks. It explores how the basis and gains from trade in free enterprise and centrally planned economies may be related to computer networks. In particular, institutions and procedures developed in the context of international trade and finance suggest ways to facilitate multilateral exchange and to cushion the adjustment process within a network.

## 13. A Note on “The Equivalence of Integer Programs to Constrained Recursive Systems”
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Kafpauf
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
Nanda proposes (Management Science, March, 1973) an algorithm for transforming a general integer programming problem with elements 0, +1, or −1 in the constraint matrix into an equivalent one in which the primary constraints are supposed to form an integral, recursive substitution system. Unfortunately, the algorithm does not always guarantee this. This note explains why and gives the addition which must be made to the algorithm to yield the results desired by Nanda.

## 14. Estimating the Mean and Variance of Subjective Distributions in PERT and Decision Analysis
### Author(s):
- C. Perry
- I. D. Greig
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1975
### Abstract:
The original PERT formulae [5] employ the mode and endpoints to estimate the mean and standard deviation of subjective probability distributions. Though widely-used, they have met with criticism for their inaccuracy, and for their being limited to the beta distribution when there is no a priori reason why the distribution should be beta ([4], [6]). This note presents alternative, accurate and relatively distribution-free formulae for estimating the means and standard deviations of subjective probability distributions.
