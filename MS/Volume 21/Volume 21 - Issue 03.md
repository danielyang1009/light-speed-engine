## 1. Optimal Allocations in the Construction of k-Out-of-n Reliability Systems
### Author(s):

- S. M. Ross
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
We want to build n components so as to form an n component system which will function if at least k of the components function. If x dollars are invested in building a component, then this component will function with probability P(x). Given a total income of A dollars, the problem of interest is to determine how much money we should invest in each component so as to maximize the probability of attaining a functioning system. This problem is considered both in the sequential and in the nonsequential cases. Conditions under which it is optimal to allocate A/n units at each stage, when A is your initial fortune, are presented. The special case P(x) = min(x, 1) is also considered in detail.

## 2. Planning Horizons for the Dynamic Lot Size Model with Backlogging
### Author(s):
- Joseph D. Blackburn
- Howard Kunreuther
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
Planning horizons are developed for the dynamic economic lot site model with backlogging when the marginal production cost is either constant or variable. The inventory holding and backlogging cost functions are assumed to be concave. An efficient forward algorithm generalizes the Eppen-Gould-Pashigian procedure and enables us to place bounds on the optimal production plan should a horizon not be found.

## 3. Optimum Checking Schedules for Systems Subject to Random Failure
### Author(s):
- Joseph B. Keller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
An optimum checking schedule is one that minimizes the expected cost, which is the sum of the cost of checking and the expected loss due to an undetected failure. The problem is made tractable by supposing that checking is so frequent that it can be described by a continuous density n(t) of checks per unit time. The optimum n(t) is found by the methods of the calculus of variations. An explicit result is given when the loss is proportional to the duration of an undetected failure. A minimax solution is also given for the case in which the probability of failure is not known.

## 4. Inspection Procedures for Markov Chains
### Author(s):
- Harold Sackrowitz
- Ester Samuel-Cahn
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
Consider a production process where the categories of successive units form a Markov chain with known transition matrix. Whenever a unit is produced, we may, at a fixed cost, inspect it. If its value is less than maximal, we may replace it with a perfect (maximal value) unit. We obtain optimal inspection procedures (procedures for which the value of the outgoing units is high and which keep the cost of inspection down).

## 5. Stochastic Programming and Decision Analysis: An Apparent Dilemma
### Author(s):
- Roger A. Blau
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
An example is given which demonstrates that using a decision theory analysis for the basic chance-constrained model of stochastic linear programming may lead to an apparent dilemma, namely, 0 > EVSI > EVPI. The problem is discussed and a resolution suggested.

## 6. A Linear Program for Economic Lot Sizes using Labor Priorities
### Author(s):
- J. Gaylord May
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents the development of a mathematical model to generate economic lot sizes, on a weekly basis, for an assembly-type shop. The model appears as a linear program which optimizes assigned labor priorities. Included is a description of the results achieved from a successful implementation of the model into the assembly operations.

## 7. The Assortment Problem with Probabilistic Demands
### Author(s):
- David W. Pentico
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
The early work done on the assortment problem assumed known demands and additive and proportional substitution cost functions for single period problems. The extension of this problem (to consider probabilistic demands and multiple periods) complicates the problem considerably. By making some assumptions about the pattern of demands and the form of a reasonable solution, the problem can be approached by using dynamic programming thus finding the shortest route through a network.

## 8. Expected Objective Value of a Stochastic Linear Program and the Degree of Uncertainty of Parameters
### Author(s):
- Hiroyuki Itami
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
In this paper, we characterize the relationship between the expected optimal value of a stochastic linear program and a stochastic program with recourse and the degree of uncertainty in the objective function coefficients c and the stipulation vector b. It is shown that under certain conditions the expected objective value is nondecreasing as the degree of uncertainty in c increases and the opposite is true for the case of b. The degree of uncertainty of a random vector is defined in terms of a covariance matrix. Some managerial interpretations are also given.

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
The equivalence of Bayesian equilibria of two-person games with incomplete information and Nash equilibria of certain n-person polymatrix games is demonstrated by means of a specific “Selten model.” As a byproduct, constructions recently developed for polymatrix games are available for Bayesian equilibria.

### Author(s):
- Bruce L. Miller
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
This paper examines real-time decision rules for a U.S. Air Force inventory system where items are repaired rather than “used up.” The problem is to decide which user in the system has the greatest need for the newly available inventory items coming out of repair.

## 12. A Statistical Estimator in a Problem of Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):
- Edmund H. Mantell
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
The assumed situation is as follows: two cumulative distribution functions F and G are in constant (unknown) ratio θ, for values of the random variables below t* (assumed known); F and G may behave entirely independently above t*. Observations on a sample from F are then used to obtain unbiased maximum likelihood estimates of and of other unknown parameters of G, denoted by λ. The estimators have application in problems of stochastic dominance in the context of portfolio analysis and in other situations of intertwining cumulative probability distributions.

## 13. Computational Delays
### Author(s):
- S. D. Deshmukh
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
Decision-making processes usually involve time-consuming and costly operations of observation and communication of the state of the environment and generation and implementation of appropriate actions. Collectively these activities may be called computational and the procedure required to carry them out may be called an algorithm. If the environment is changing stochastically the fixed computational delay involved in operating the algorithm yields obsolete actions resulting in reduced expected return. The loss as a function of delay is a measure of efficiency of the algorithm which depends upon the stochastic properties of the environment. If it is possible to reduce the loss by employing a faster algorithm at a higher cost, the algorithm may be optimally designed and selected from a given family.

## 14. A Penalty Function Procedure for Sensitivity Analysis of Concave Programs
### Author(s):
- Stephen Howe
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
Given a concave program, consider its optimal objective value as a function of the right-hand side. The behavior of this optimal response function reflects the sensitivity of the objective value to changes in the right-hand side. A scheme involving the optimization of a penalty function is developed for determining the value and gradient of the optimal response function at points within a region of interest. This scheme is then applied to a simple example to illustrate its potential usefulness.

## 15. Preferred Rules in Continuous Time Markov Decision Processes
### Author(s):
- Mark R. Lembersky
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
Motivated by a planning horizon result for continuous time Markov decision chains, we study decision rules, called preferred, which may be used in the initially stationary part of nearly optimal policies. We characterize these rules and then, under conditions involving state recurrence and accessibility, consider finding such rules. We also discuss the connection between preferred rules and certain discounted process decision rules, and the role of preferred rules in optimal policies.

## 17. Note—A Dynamic Programming Approach to Capacity Expansion with Specialization
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1974
### Abstract:
The capacity expansion problem with specialization involves two classes of growing demand and two types of capacity. One type of capacity can supply both demands, while the second can supply only one. The specialization problem is an extreme case of the multilocation capacity expansion problem, and dynamic programming approaches for the multilocation problem can be adapted to solve the specialization problem.
