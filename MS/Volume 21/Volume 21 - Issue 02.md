## 1. Factors Affecting Adoption of a Quantitative Method for R&D Project Selection
### Author(s):
- P. Michael Maher
- Albert H. Rubenstein
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
In the field of research and development (R&D), “state-of-the-art” project selection models are not being widely adopted. This paper reports on the results of an attempt to develop, test, and evaluate systematically an R&D project selection technique in an operating R&D organization. The technique employed was a modified risk analysis model. The results suggest that an individual's assessment of the value of the data generated by an R&D project selection technique is an extremely important factor in determining his willingness to adopt the technique. The relative importance of two determinants of adoption: perceived changes in organizational processes resulting from the use of a project selection model and the importance of the strategies used to introduce a model into an organization, appear to run counter to the thinking of many management theorists who tend to emphasize the importance of the organizational process and the importance of the strategy for change.

## 2. The University Library: Analysis and Proposals
### Author(s):
- Charles B. Weinberg
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
The operation of the university library as a means to supply information is examined. It is shown that despite the increase in size of libraries, their standard of service is declining. Reasons for this decline are advanced. The strategic goals of the library are redefined with implications for the library's acquisition, shelving, and retention policies. A Bayesian approach is then developed for determining the information value of the library's resources. In contrast to other work in this field, stress is placed on user evaluation of the library's resources. The approach developed is applicable to decisions relating both to the acquisition of volumes and the maintenance of collections.

## 3. Optimal Foreclosure Policies
### Author(s):
- Gordon Pye
- Ahmet Tezel
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
The value of a collateralized loan subject to default is obtained using a dynamic programming approach. The optimal foreclosure policy for a special case is derived based on the number of payments which are late. These results are then applied to an example taken from a casebook on financial institutions.

## 4. A Computer-Based Corporate Planning System
### Author(s):
- William F. Hamilton
- Michael A. Moses
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
The key to effective analytical support of the strategic planning process is not simply a corporate model, but an integrated system of models with appropriate software support. This paper describes a computer-based corporate planning system which combines the analytical power of optimization with simulation capabilities and more specialized planning models as elements of an interactive management system. The system has been designed to aid both periodic and ad hoc planning decisions in a large multi-national firm and can be implemented in a wide variety of corporate contexts.

## 5. Solving the “Marketing Mix” Problem using Geometric Programming
### Author(s):
- V. Balachandran
- Dennis H. Gensch
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
This paper investigates the optimal allocation of the marketing budget within the marketing-mix decision variables so that sales (or profit) is maximized in a planning horizon. Since the influence of marketing mix variables upon sales are, in reality, nonlinear and interactive, a geometric programming algorithm is used that solves this problem. A procedure to estimate a functional of sales on the marketing mix and environmental variables utilizing the experienced judgments of the firm's executives and the raw data is provided. The derived functional is later optimized by the Geometric Programming algorithm under a constraint set consisting of budget and strategy restrictions imposed by a firm's marketing environment, and conditions under which the optimal solution is either local or global are identified. An empirical application for a large midwestern brewery is provided which utilizes and illustrates both the estimation an optimization procedures.

## 6. Coefficient of Network Complexity
### Author(s):
- Richard A. Kaimann
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
The degree of complexity of a critical path network may be classified by calculating a Coefficient of Network Complexity. It is defined as the quotient of activities squared divided by events or preceding work items squared divided by work items. Three distinct contributions are offered. First, the CNC may serve as an indicator of the attention spent in planning the project. Second, the CNC may be used to derive a predictor of network computer processing time. Third, the CNC value suggests the appropriate processing scheme.

## 7. Management Information Systems: Appreciation and Involvement
### Author(s):
- E. Burton Swanson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
Failures in the implementation of management information systems (“MIS's”) can be attributed in part to a lack of managerial “involvement” and “appreciation.” The concepts of involvement and appreciation are defined, and their measurement in a real-world research setting is presented. The testing of several hypotheses in this setting indicates that managers who involve themselves with the MIS will appreciate the system, and that managers who are uninvolved will be unappreciative.

## 8. A Parametric Decomposition Approach for the Solution of Uncapacitated Location Problems
### Author(s):
- Ralph W. Swain
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new approach to determining the optimal facility locations for uncapacitated location problems in two stages. First, it is shown that a subset of all solutions to the uncapacitated public facility location problem can be obtained by considering a closely related private location problem. The exact nature of the problem is established using the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier results given by Everett. In the second section of the paper a particularly efficient parametric decomposition algorithm, which is based on the results of the first section, is presented. Computational results are given which summarize the current level of experience with the algorithm.

## 9. Two-Stage Replacement Strategies and Their Application to Manpower Planning
### Author(s):
- David Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
Two-stage replacement strategies are described and related to manpower systems. This consists of setting up a training grade to supplement an organisation of fixed size. Results are obtained to show what site the training grade should be in order that, on average, people spend some predetermined length of time in the training grade before promotion. Two promotion rules are used, viz. promotion by seniority and promotion at random. Numerical results are given for particular completed length of service distributions.

## 10. Calculation of Investment Portfolios with Risk Free Borrowing and Lending
### Author(s):
- W. T. Ziemba

- R. Brooks-Hill
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of portfolio selection for a risk averse investor wishing to allocate his resources among several investment opportunities in order to maximize the expected utility of final wealth. The calculation of the optimal investment proportions generally requires the solution of a stochastic program whose dimension is the number of risky investments. The computations are simplified dramatically when there is a risk free asset and the investment returns are jointly normally distributed. In this case Tobin has shown that the investment proportions in the risky assets are independent of the utility function and Lintner has shown that these proportions may be obtained from the solution of a fractional program. It is shown under mild hypotheses that the fractional program has a pseudo-concave objective and that the program always has a unique solution. The solution may be sought in several ways, perhaps moat efficiently via Lemke's algorithm applied to a linear complementarity problem. The optimal investment proportions in all assets may be found by solving a stochastic program having one random variable and one decision variable via a search technique. Data on the major pooled Canadian equity pension funds were used to provide an empirical test of the suggested solution approach. Five common classes of utility functions were utilised with varying parameter values. For each class there are smooth curves that related the investment in the risk free asset to the parameters of the utility function. The investor is more risk averse when faced with quarterly data.

## 11. Computation of (S, s) Ordering Policy Parameters
### Author(s):
- Ralph D. Snyder
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
In this paper a periodic review stock system using the so-called (S, s) ordering policy is considered. New and more accurate approximations are found for calculating the optimal values of the reorder point s and the minimum order quantity Δ = S − s. When demands are normally distributed it is shown that the six cost and distribution parameters associated with these approximations can be combined into two effective parameters. This facilitates the derivation of two graphs which can be used with some relatively simple computational procedures to determine approximate optimal values for the reorder point s and minimum order quantity Δ.

## 13. Note—A comment on the “Distribution System Simulator”
### Author(s):
- Arnoldo C. Hax
### Published:

### Abstract:
Connors et al. [Connors, M. M., C. Coray, C. J. Cuccaro, W. K. Green, D. W. Low, H. M. Markowitz. 1972. The distribution system simulator. Management Sci.18 (8, April).], have developed a Distribution System Simulator (DSS) that produces a customized simulation model for large scale, physical distribution systems. Aggarwal [Aggarwal, S. C. 1973. A critique of the distribution system simulation. Management Sci.20 (4, December).] provided a critique of specific topics regarding DSS design in order to make it more effective in an operating environment. Rather than dealing with detailed issues, I would like to take an overall look at the approach suggested by Connors et al. to support logistics decisions, emphasising general strengths and limitations to their proposed system, and to recommend some constructive ideas to overcome some of the current DSS weaknesses.

## 14. Précis—Assessment of Airframe Production Cost Risk
### Author(s):
- John A. Finchum, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1974
### Abstract:
Cost growth of weapon systems is a major concern of the DOD and its contractors. Almost half of the cost overrun on major weapon systems during the late 1960's and early 1970's was due to refinement of original cost estimates for reasons other than changes in performance, economic conditions, engineering and construction scheduling. A fruitful area to which to apply cost risk assessment techniques is the air-frame production cost during the proposal stage of an aircraft.
