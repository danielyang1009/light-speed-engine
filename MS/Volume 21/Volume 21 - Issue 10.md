## 1. An Aircraft Collision Model
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Machol
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
In the 1960's a controversy arose regarding the safety of navigation standards of jet aircraft over the North Atlantic Ocean, which led to a confrontation between airline owners and pilots. A systems analysis led to a redesigned and improved system which resolved the controversy by giving each side at least as much as it originally requested, in terms of minimizing cost on the one hand and maximizing safety on the other. This paper describes the problem, the controversy, the model, the data collection and reduction, the solution, and the implementation.

## 2. A Model of a Distribution Network Aggregate Performance
### Author(s):
- Philippe A. Naert
- Alain V. Bultez
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
A model to evaluate distribution network performance is developed extending earlier work by Hartung and Fisher [Hartung, P. H., Fisher, J. L. 1965. Brand switching and mathematical programming in market expansion. Management Sci.11 (10, August) 231–243.]. Our model differs on two counts: (1) it explicitly considers market dynamics and (2) the transition probability functions are robust. It is applied to describe the competitive position of a brand of gasoline on the Italian retail market.

## 3. Dynamic Price Models for New-Product Planning
### Author(s):

- Chet Lakhani
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
The major points established in this paper are: classic marginal pricing is far from optimum for a rapidly evolving business; more appropriate dynamic models can be formulated if one has some feeling for the dominant evolutionary forces in the business environment; and, planning based on the dynamic models can lead to a significant improvement in the long run profit performance. Two developments in the management science literature, the experience curve phenomenon and market-penetration models, are used to illustrate the nature of the dynamic feedback between market and production activity which causes a new growth business to evolve. A specific illustrative example is offered which demonstrates the fact that dynamic price models can be used to test the long run consequences of specific pricing rules or to determine the optimum long run pricing scenario within the context of any constraints which a manager might wish to impose. As opposed to the conventional static theory which emphasizes the instantaneous profit flow, the dynamic models use an appropriately discounted accumulated profit as the major parameter for making value judgments. The specific example considered emphasizes the importance of these ideas for a growth market and suggests that dynamic models can lead to as much as an order of magnitude more profit in the long run than the conventional static theory. More modest, but significant, improvements in long run performance can be obtained in a moderate growth business.

## 4. The Importance of “Weltanschauung” in Operations Research: The Case of the School Busing Problem
### Author(s):
- David H. Stimson
- Ronald P. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
Busing of children to achieve racial balance in schools is an important and controversial social issue. In studying the school busing problem, various groups (e.g., operations researchers, educators, sociologists, psychologists) proceed quite differently because of their different “Weltanschauungen”—their different perceptions of reality, their different world views. Operations researchers have viewed the school busing problem as a desegregation problem (i.e., simply physically mixing the races) while others have seen it as an integration problem (i.e., helping to bring about a viable, multi-racial society). The usefulness of the desegregation view of operations researchers is evaluated in light of findings from the educational literature about various aspects of the school busing problem. Explicit attention by operations researchers to the concept of “Weltanschauung” should result in studies more useful to school officials and administrators. Statements made about the role of “Weltanschauung” in operations research studies of the school busing problem may be applied to operations research studies in other areas of social concern such as health, welfare, and law enforcement.

## 5. Implementation of Analytical Planning Systems
### Author(s):
- Michael A. Moses
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
Decision makers in large organizations are faced with numerous alternative allocations of investment funds, financing possibilities and governmental and financial restrictions. Sophisticated strategic planning systems can enhance management's decision efficiency by assisting in the selection and implementation of optimal policies. This paper describes one such system with emphasis on the design concept and the planning procedure in its particular organizational setting. For demonstration purposes, the example of implementation experience in acquisition analysis is presented.

## 6. Optimization of Pentathlon Training Plans
### Author(s):
- Shaul P. Ladany
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
An approach has been outlined to determine the optimal weekly training plan of a pentathlon athlete, (a woman) in order to maximize her score at week-end competitions. The various training activities which have an influence on the results in each of the five pentathlon events, as well as the relationship between the amount of training in these activities and the results, have been established by regression analysis. The total score from the five events, depending on the result in each event, and subject both to the total time which the athlete is willing to devote to training and to various physiological requirements for balancing the development of the athlete's body, has been maximized using linear programming. Suggestions have also been put forth for the application of the method to cases in which nonlinear relationships between results and training activities exist.

## 7. Solution of the Multi-Asset Finite Horizon Investment Renewal Problem
### Author(s):
- Robert R. Trippi
- Basheer M. Khumawala
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
The multi-asset investment renewal problem is characterized by two types of costs: transaction costs incurred when any renewal takes place at a point in time, and investment costs which are associated with renewing individual assets. A discrete-time version of this renewal scheduling problem is formulated as an integer program that, due to its structure, admits to an efficient branch and bound approach to solution. Computational experience with the solution algorithm is presented.

### Author(s):
- Norman Baker
- James Freeland
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to provide a current assessment of the literature addressed to quantitative models of the R and D project selection and resource allocation decision. In order to facilitate the critique and assessment the literature is somewhat arbitrarily divided into benefit measurement and resource allocation methods. The strengths and limitations of existing knowledge are identified with an emphasis on empirical investigations. Several research areas are identified and briefly described.

## 9. Antithetic Variates, Common Random Numbers and Optimal Computer Time Allocation in Simulation
### Author(s):
- Jack P. C. Kleijnen
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
Two simple variance reduction techniques are discussed, viz. antithetic variates and common random numbers. Their joint application creates undesirable negative correlations between the responses of two simulated systems. Therefore three alternatives are considered: antithetics only, common random numbers only, antithetic and common random numbers combined. No alternative is always best as is shown by analytical results for extremely simple systems and simulation results for simple queuing systems. Therefore a procedure is derived that starts with some pilot runs for both systems and estimates which alternative minimizes the variance; at the same time this procedure allocates the limited amount of computer time to the two systems in an optimal way. Results of the application of the procedure to several queuing systems are presented. Because of certain disadvantages of the procedure we may decide to select alternative 1 (antithetics only) a priori. Then the procedure can still be used for the optimal computer time allocation.

## 10. Multi-Item Lot Size Scheduling by Heuristic Part I: With Fixed Resources
### Author(s):
- E. F. Peter Newson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
The multi-item lot size problem has been a formal management issue for some decades. The lot size decision of how much to produce (and when) usually considers the trade-off between lost productivity from frequent set-ups and short runs and the higher inventory costs arising from longer runs. When the decision must also consider shared limited production resources, the problem becomes complex.

### Author(s):
- Robert F. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1975
### Abstract:
A computationally efficient forward algorithm for the Economic Lot Size Model is developed. It uses a Dominance Relation and the Ordering Cost to limit the solution space. The Dominance Relation developed includes the standard planning horizon theorem. Extensions for price breaks and monotonically nonincreasing production costs are presented.
