## 1. On Management Myth-Information Systems

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
This paper describes some key defining characteristics of a special class of information systems known as Management Myth-Information Systems (MMIS) or story-telling information systems. MMIS are information systems [Mason, Richard O., Ian I. Mitroff. 1973. A program for research on management information systems. Management Sci.19 (5, January) 475–487.] which present information to a decision-maker by means of stories. In an MMIS, a scientific datum by itself is not information. In an MMIS, information is information if and only if it is tied to an appropriate story or myth that has meaning to the individual who needs the information, the organization in which he is located, and the type of problem that he faces. This defines the key variables underlying an MMIS. As such, the study of the critical literature dealing with the nature and function of mythology becomes central to the design of MMIS. One of the key purposes of this paper is to suggest how the literature of mythology and the phenomenon of story-telling can be used in the design of MMIS if not for information systems in general.

## 2. The Logarithmic Investor's Decision to Acquire Costly Information
### Author(s):
- James R. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
This paper explores the relationship between the decision to purchase a costly information system and the wealth of an investor with a logarithmic utility function, where the information system may provide information concerning the payoffs from risky investments. It is shown, for the logarithmic investor, that (a) there is a wealth “break-even point” below which it is suboptimal to purchase an information system at a fixed cost, and (b) the amount the investor would be willing to pay for access to the information system is a linearly increasing function of his wealth.

## 3. A Linear Programming Analysis of Paper Recycling
### Author(s):
- C. Roger Glassey
- Virendra K. Gupta
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
A simple linear model is constructed for production, use and recycling of various paper and related products. This model is used to estimate the maximum feasible recycling rate given the current state of pulp and paper technology. Parametric linear programming is used to investigate the effect of the efficiency of collecting, sorting and transporting waste paper on the fraction recycled.

## 4. Heuristics and Optimizing Techniques Applied to Long Range Facility Planning for Hospital Ancillary Departments
### Author(s):
- Jay A. Vora
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
A conceptual framework for long range facility planning of ancillary departments in hospitals is proposed and successfully applied to a radiology department. The framework involves the interactions of optimizing techniques with heuristics for effective and efficient achievement of an organizational objective. It uses outputs from ad optimizing technique as inputs to a heuristic, and vice versa. This approach does not guarantee an absolute optimal plan, but it does provide the best plan relative to the alternatives developed by following a systematic search within the framework.

## 5. Forecasting for Largest Earthquakes
### Author(s):
- Tuncel M. Yegulalp
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
The primary concern of this paper is the establishment of a forecasting procedure for largest earthquake magnitudes of the next n years. It is shown that the use of the third-type asymptotic distribution of the largest values as an approximation to the exact distribution provides for an expression for the expected value and the mode of the largest earthquake magnitude in the next n years. An example of the application of this procedure is given and the results are compared with actual observations.

## 6. Aspects of One-Stage Voting Rules
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
Under the assumption that voters have linear preference orders, this study investigates the propensity of simple weighted scoring rules to yield a winning alternative which is the same as the alternative (if any) which would win using a norm rule such as the simple-majority rule or the Borda rule. The scoring rules examined are of the types implemented by ballot instructions such as “vote for two of the following seven alternatives” and “indicate your first (1), second (2), and third (3) choices from the following list of ten candidates.” The results, which apply only to situations where one of a number of alternatives is to be chosen on the basis of a single ballot, may be useful in designing balloting and scoring procedures for these types of situations.

## 7. Multi-Period Stochastic Dominance
### Author(s):
- Haim Levy
- Jacob Paroush
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
First degree stochastic dominance rules for uncertain options (distributions of returns) have been developed for the following two cases: (a) multi-period additive utility functions, (b) univariate utility functions and compound distributions of returns. In the first case, the suggested rule is a necessary and sufficient criterion for efficiency analysis, while in the second case we provide only sufficiency conditions for dominance.

## 8. Determination of Optimum Packaging Frequency of Items Jointly Replenished
### Author(s):
- S. K. Goyal
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents a systematic procedure for obtaining the optimum packaging frequencies for a number of items which are manufactured jointly but packaged individually immediately alter manufacture. The method described in the paper is equally applicable to those problems where the optimum purchasing policy is to be obtained for a number of items procured from a single supplier. An example involving twenty jointly replenished items is solved to illustrate the procedure given in the paper.

## 9. Management Control of Blood Through a Short-Term Supply-Demand Forecast System
### Author(s):
- George M. Frankfurter
- Kenneth E. Kendall
- C. Carl Pegels
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
Design, development, implementation and operation of a short-term blood inventory level forecast system is described. The primary purpose of the forecast system is to alert blood center management to the short-term inventory level of blood supplies so that they can take corrective notion to either reduce or increase blood collections. A test is performed on the system, and it is demonstrated that, management took action to reduce collections in response to higher than necessary inventory levels and increased collections during a period when insufficient inventory levels were forecast.

## 10. An Input-Output Analysis of the Costs of Air Pollution Control
### Author(s):
- Alan S. Cohen
- Arthur P. Hurter, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
Pollution control costs ore considered in three categories: (i) costs of control equipment, (ii) costs of switching to cleaner fuels or processes, and (iii) costs to consumers measured by changes in a consumer price index. The sum of type (i) and (ii) are “direct” costs; while (iii) is an “indirect” cost. An input-output model is developed which permits inclusion of both direct and indirect costs in the measure of pollution control costs. It is demonstrated that, when there is at least one firm in the community described by the model required to control its pollution, the prices of all consumer goods will be higher after the imposition of controls than before; and the increase in price will be at least as great as the direct costs of pollution control in the production of each good. If each industry can independently minimize its direct cost of pollution control, then the indirect costs will also be minimized. When shortages of clean fuels are considered, firms and industries cannot all control their emissions optimally. In this case, overall minimization of the direct costs of control will not generally result in minimization of the indirect costs as well. However, a particular kind of weighting of industry by industry direct control costs is developed, such that minimization of this weighted sum results in minimization of indirect costs as well.

## 11. Forecasting Market Shares of Alternative Home-Heating Units by Markov Process using Transition Probabilities Estimated from Aggregate Time Series Data
### Author(s):
- Ali Ezzati
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to forecast the market shares of alternative home-heating units: oil-burners, gas-burners and electric-heating units for the United States. The forecasting method used is The Markov Process with estimated transition probability matrices. The transition probabilities represent whether households will continue to use the same heating unit which they have used in the recent past or switch to another type unit. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation techniques have been used to estimate these transition probabilities from aggregate historical market shares of alternative home-heating units.

## 12. Application of Quasi-Integer Programming to the Solution of Menu Planning Problems with Variable Portion Size
### Author(s):
- Ronald D. Armstrong
- Prabhakant Sinha
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
This paper presents the application of a modified mixed-integer programming algorithm to plan menus in which the portion size of the menu items can vary over a specified positive range. Previous mathematical programming formulations of menu planning problems have either required the variables representing menu items to be bivalent, or have formulated the problem with food groups as decision variables and no integer requirements at all. The former gives rise to a zero-one programming problem and the latter to a “feed-mix” problem. In many instances, a more realistic formulation would require that if a menu item is offered, its portion size must be between a specified upper and lower bound. Although this paper addresses itself chiefly to menu planning, it is readily seen that problems in capital budgeting may be tractable with a similar formulation. It is shown how a branch-and-bound algorithm for mixed-integer programming of the type proposed by Beale and Tomlin can be modified to solve the quasi-integer programming problem resulting from a variable portion size formulation of menu planning problems.

## 13. Note—On the Maximization of the Geometric Mean with Lognormal Return Distribution
### Author(s):
- Edwin J. Elton
- Martin J. Gruber
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1974
### Abstract:
In this paper we discuss the relevancy of the geometric mean as a portfolio selection criteria. A procedure for finding that portfolio with the highest geometric mean when returns on portfolios are lognormally distributed is presented. The development of this algorithm involves a proof that the portfolio with maximum geometric mean lies on the efficient frontier in arithmetic mean variance space. This finding has major implications for the relevancy of much of portfolio and general equilibrium theory. These implications are explored.
