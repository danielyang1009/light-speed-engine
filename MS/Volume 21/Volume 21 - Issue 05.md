## 1. Optimal Funding Paths for a Class of Risky R&D Projects
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
The problem of financing risky R&D projects over time has been stated as an optimal control problem by Hess [Hess, S. W. 1962. A dynamic approach to R&D budgeting and project selection. IRE Transactions on Engineering ManagementEM-9 (December) 170–178.], Lucas [Lucas, Robert E. 1971. Optimal management of a research and development project. Management Sci.17 (11, July) 679–697.], and Kamien and Schwartz [Kamien, M. I., N. L. Schwartz. 1971. Expenditure patterns for risky R&D projects. J. Appl. Probab.VIII (1, March) 60–72.]. In this paper, the model is extended to allow the possibility of time dependent returns. The authors restate the problem as a finite horizon continuous time dynamic programming problem, and demonstrate uniform convergence to a unique, autonomous (infinite horizon) solution for the present value of the project and optimal spending rate as a function of expended effort. Further conclusions are shown for the time dependent model with exponential completion probability and for the time independent model.

## 2. The Steady-State Queueing Time Distribution for the M/G/1 Finite Capacity Queue
### Author(s):
- Stephen S. Lavenberg
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
We derive an expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the steady-state distribution of the queueing time for the M/G/1 finite capacity queue. The derivation proceeds in terms of a related 2-stage closed cyclic queueing network. The resulting expression is a rational function of the steady-state probabilities of the imbedded Markov chain at departure epochs and of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the service time distribution. The expression can be differentiated readily in order to obtain moments of the steady-state queueing time and some numerical results for the mean and coefficient of variation are presented.

## 3. Effects of Shop Size and Labor Flexibility in Labor and Machine Limited Production Systems
### Author(s):
- John S. Fryer
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simulation study that examines the influence of system size and labor flexibility on the performance effects of dispatching and labor control decision rules in labor and machine limited production systems. Four production systems are used—a small job shop, a medium job shop, a large job shop in which workers may be transferred between major organizational divisions, and a large job shop in which workers cannot be transferred between divisions. For each system the decision rules for dispatching and labor control are varied. Comparisons are made of the relative effects of the decision rules, for the different systems, on mean flow-time, flow-time variance and number of worker transfers.

## 4. An Optimization Algorithm for a Linear Model of a Simulation System
### Author(s):
- Basil A. Kalymon
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
This paper explores the normative theory of simulation within the context of an optimization algorithm for a linear programming model of the experimental setting. The simulation is viewed as a random generalized mathematical function which provides an uncertain evaluation of any policy within a specified constraint set. A sequential experimental design aimed at identifying the feasible levels of the policy variables which provide the optimal level of expected response is presented and analyzed. The results of numerical tests of the proposed procedure are discussed.

## 5. Finding the n Most Vital Links in Flow Networks
### Author(s):
- H. Donald Ratliff
- G. Thomas Sicilia
- S. H. Lubore
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
The n most vital links of a flow network are defined as those n arcs whose simultaneous removal from the network causes the greatest decrease in the throughput capability of the remaining system between a specified pair of nodes. These n arcs are shown to be the n largest capacity arcs in a particular cut. A solution procedure is developed which involves sequentially modifying the network so as to make this cut eventually become the cut with smallest capacity. An algorithm with computational results is presented.

## 6. Minimizing the Time-in-System Variance for a Finite Jobset
### Author(s):
- Linus Schrage
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
There are a finite number of jobs to be scheduled on a single machine. All jobs are available from the start and the objective is to sequence the jobs so that the time-in-system (or equivalently, the completion time) variance is minimized. A number of necessary conditions for an optimal sequencing (which for small jobsets turn out to be sufficient) are presented.

## 7. Flowshop Sequencing Problem with Ordered Processing Time Matrices
### Author(s):
- M. L. Smith
- S. S. Panwalkar
- R. A. Dudek
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
A flowshop sequencing problem having an ordered processing time matrix is defined. Job and machine characteristics resulting in processing time relationships that have logical and practical bases are discussed. An optimizing solution procedure for a special class of ordered matrix problem is presented along with proof of optimality.

## 8. On the Optimality of Myopic Policies in Sequential Decision Problems
### Author(s):
- Yvo M. I. Dirickx
- L. Peter Jennergren
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
A sufficient condition for the optimality of myopic policies is derived for a class of sequential decision problems. A necessary condition is also derived. The usefulness of the sufficient condition is illustrated in the context of a dynamic portfolio selection problem, a matched sampling problem, and a multi-item inventory model.

## 9. Discriminant Functions and Majority Voting
### Author(s):
- J. M. Blin
- Andrew B. Whinston
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
This paper is based on the notion of discriminatory power of a pattern classifier acting over a feature space. Discriminant functions are normally used to trace out regions of the feature space corresponding to specific pattern classes. Indeterminate cases occur whenever a pattern lies on a class boundary. The number of occurrences of such indeterminacies measures the relative discriminatory power of a family of discriminant functions. In this paper these concepts are applied to majority voting decisions. It is first shown how regular majority voting leads to discriminant functions with insufficient discriminatory power whenever intransitive social ordering occurs. An (improved) family of discriminant functions is proposed to resolve such cases.

## 10. Rim Multiparametric Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- Tomas Gal
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
The rim multiparametric linear programming problem (RMPLP) is a parametric problem with a vector-parameter in both the right-hand side and objective function (i.e., in the “rim”). The RMPLP determines the region K* ⊂ E* such that the problem, maximize z(λ) = cT(λ)x, subject to Ax = b(λ), x ≧ 0, has a finite optimal solution for all λ ∈ K*.

## 11. Production Smoothing with Fluctuating Price
### Author(s):
- Dov Pekelman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
The model presented in this paper deals with a firm facing a known price which varies over time during some finite period [0, T]. The firm wishes to determine the production rate at each instant of that interval which will maximize profit, when adjustment of output incurs additional cost.

## 12. Note—A Computational Survey of Methods for the Set Covering Problem
### Author(s):
- Nicos Christofides
- S. Korman
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
This paper is a survey of available methods for the solution of the Set Covering Problem. The prime objective has been to establish the computational efficiency and relative merits of the various algorithms that have been proposed. To this end five methods have been programmed and tested on the same set of 33 test problems some of which can be found in the literature and the rest of which were randomly generated. Some of the methods examined have—as far as the authors are aware—never been previously tested, and in some cases some surprising results have been noted.

## 13. Note on Finite Convergence of Exterior Penalty Functions
### Author(s):
- Klaus Truemper
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1975
### Abstract:
It is shown that existence of a saddle point of the Lagrangian function in an optimization problem is sufficient to assure finite convergence of the linear exterior penalty function. Also, an estimate of the penalty weight is given that yields ϵ-convergence for the quadratic exterior penalty function.
