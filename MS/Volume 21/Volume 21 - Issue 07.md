## 1. Exceptional Paper—Markov Renewal Theory: A Survey
### Author(s):
- Erhan Çinlar
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
The objective is to survey the major results and applications in an informal setting. The exposition is restricted to finite state spaces; some real problems are modelled and the lines of attack are indicated; and an extensive bibliography is provided to get a further glimpse of the variety of applications. Throughout, the parallels with renewal theory are brought out, and the unity of thought afforded by the formalism of Markov renewal equations is stressed.

## 2. Retaining Productive Units: A Dynamic Programming Model with a Steady State Solution
### Author(s):
- James Flynn
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
We consider a system consisting of productive units which age (the units could be men). As these units age, they tend to leave the system and must be replaced. We can retard this by spending more money on them. The system is required to maintain a constant production rate. The latter is a linear function of the number of units in the different age groups. The desideratum is an optimal retention policy. We formulate an infinite-horizon deterministic dynamic programming model and find a steady state policy (a policy under which the system moves directly to a target state) whose cost differs from the optimal cost by an amount whose bound is independent of the interest rate. We also find optimal policies for some special cases.

## 3. Supply and Redistribution Rules for Two-Location Inventory Systems: One-Period Analysis
### Author(s):
- Chandrasekhar Das
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
This paper considers a two-location stochastic inventory problem with periodic review. It is assumed that replenishment may be ordered only at times of periodic review but a provision is made for transfer of stock between the locations at predetermined times within the replenishment cycle. Problems of determining jointly optimal stockage and transfer rules according to the expected total cost criterion are investigated. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimality of a simple class of Base Stock Conserving (BSC) transfer rules is first established. The related optimal stockage rule is then characterized for the single period model of captive sales.

## 4. Waiting Time Distribution in a Poisson Queue with a General Bulk Service Rule
### Author(s):
- J. Medhi
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
This paper relates to a queueing system with Poisson input and exponential service time, service taking place in batches under a “general bulk service rule.” (A batch will contain no fewer than “a” and no more than “b” units.) The object of this paper is to study the waiting time distribution of such a bulk service system under steady state and also to indicate how the moments of the distribution can be obtained.

## 5. Production, Inventory and Capacity Expansion Scheduling with Integer Variables
### Author(s):
- R. H. Barchi
- F. T. Sparrow
- R. R. Vemuganti
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
The combined production-inventory and capacity expansion problem is modeled as a linear, integer program. The model assumes constant returns to scale in the production function of a firm which must meet, at minimum cost, deterministic demands for a single product over N periods with no backordering.

## 6. Zero-Sum Games with “Almost” Perfect Information
### Author(s):
- Jean-Pierre Ponssard
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
The present paper generalizes the concept of perfect information to games in which the players, while moving sequentially, remain uncertain about the actual payoff of the game because of an initial chance move. It is proved that the value of such games with “almost” perfect information can still be computed using backward induction in the game tree. The optimal behavioral strategies obtained by a dynamic procedure may, however, require randomization. A typical illustration of such games is poker.

## 7. A Semi-Infinite Game
### Author(s):
- A. L. Soyster
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
The ordinary finite, two-person, zero-sum game is completely defined by specifying an m × n game matrix A. The optimal strategies for both players, and the value of the game, can be obtained by solving a dual pair of linear programming problems. In this paper a semi-infinite game is defined; a semi-infinite game matrix has an infinite number of columns, i.e., the game is specified by a sequence of vectors {Pj} ∈ Rm. Optimal strategies and game values are shown to exist for the semi-infinite game by exploiting the relationship between these games and linear programming over cones.

## 8. A Network Approach to a Multi-Facility, Multi-Product Production Scheduling Problem Without Backordering
### Author(s):
- Robert C. Dorsey
- Thom J. Hodgson
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
A multi-product, multi-facility production scheduling problem is considered over a finite planning horizon. The horizon consists of discrete production periods during each of which at most one product can be assigned to each facility. Product demand rates are assumed to be constant over a period but not necessarily identical in all periods. All demands must be met without allowing backorders. The problem objective is to determine an assignment of products to facilities over the horizon which minimizes the sum of production and inventory carrying charges. The problem is formulated as a network flow problem for which efficient solution procedures are known. However, for an important special case a single pass algorithm is given which is more efficient than the standard flow algorithms.

## 9. Optimal Theoretic Advertising Stock Models: A Generalization Incorporating the Effects of Delayed Response from Promotional Expenditure
### Author(s):
- Don H. Mann
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
Econometric models of advertising effects incorporating the concept of advertising stock adopt the premise that prior as well as current advertising expenditure affect current sales. In general, stock may be viewed as an intangible demand-generating variable representing an accumulated effect of prior advertising expenditure.

## 10. Search and Simulation Selection of a Job-Shop Sequencing Rule
### Author(s):
- James C. Hershauer
- Ronald J. Ebert
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
A standardized approach to selecting a simple sequencing rule for decentralized application throughout a job shop is developed and illustrated. The sequencing rule is a linear combination of decision factors, each of which is initially assigned a relative weighting. The rule is then used to determine the priority of each job in the queues, and resulting shop costs are determined by computer simulation. The coefficients of the priority function are thereafter modified by a patterned search procedure to find priority coefficients that minimize expected cost per order for a specified cost structure. The cost structure is a combination of multiple response measures for the shop. Rather than leading to a “single best rule” for all job shops, the approach is a “method for finding” a sequencing rule that performs well in any specific job shop situation.

## 11. Communication to the Editor—A Note on the E-Model of Chance-Constrained Programming with Random b-Vector
### Author(s):
- Willy Gochet
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1975
### Abstract:
In an article of this journal [Eisner, Mark J., Robert S. Kaplan, Johh V. Soden. 1971. Admissible decision rules for the E-model of chance-constrained programming. Management Sci.17 (5) 337–353.], Eisner, Kaplan, and Soden proposed or extended several approaches to the triangular multistage E-model of chance constrained programs with a random b-vector. On of these approaches is called the “safety-first” approach because only decisions are allowed at any stage i which allow to take a feasible decision at any later stage.
