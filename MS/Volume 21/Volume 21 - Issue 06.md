## 1. Virtual Measures: A Variance Reduction Technique for Simulation
### Author(s):
- Grace Carter
- Edward J. Ignall
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
A variance reduction technique is presented that is effective when the system characteristic to be estimated is strongly influenced by rare events. Applications to simulations of a simple inventory system and of the New York City Fire Department, where the rare events are back orders and serious fires respectively, are described. In these simulations, virtual measures reduced computer time needed to achieve a given statistical reliability to 1/2 to 1/20 of that needed with the usual direct estimators. Relationships to other variance reduction techniques are indicated.

## 2. Conditions of Equivalence Among E-V, SSD, and E-H Portfolio Selection Criteria: The Case for Uniform, Normal and Lognormal Distributions
### Author(s):

- Nicolas Gressis
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
Conditions of equivalence are established among the following portfolio selection criteria: (1) Mean-Variance (E-V), (2) Second-Degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD), and (3) Mean-Entropy (E-H), for portfolios whose returns are characterized by-Uniform, Normal, and Lognormal probability distributions. We also assume that all portfolios derive from the same family of distributions and consider only the cases where the cumulative density functions intersect. In comparing the three selection criteria, under the three posited probability distributions, we utilize a combination of mathematical and graphical analyses. It is concluded that the three efficiency criteria are equivalent for uniformly and normally distributed portfolio returns. For lognormally distributed portfolio returns, the SSD criterion is optimal. Its efficiency, however, is sufficient but not necessary to establish efficiency for E-V and E-H. On the other hand, given the empirical similarities between E-V and SSD derived portfolios, and the close correspondence between the E-V and E-H criteria, the potential use of E-H becomes more appealing because of its distribution free nature.

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
Six National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite projects containing twenty-one contracts with approximately 1,000 changes were investigated for the purpose of developing predictive models of contract change incidence which could be used for budgetary and control purposes. Of particular interest were the number, timing, and dollar amounts of changes that can be expected to occur on future contracts.

## 4. An Optimal Inventory Model for the Intermediate Echelon When Repair is Possible
### Author(s):
- Sheldon E. Haber
- Rosedith Sitgreaves
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
The basic contribution of the paper is the development of a probabilistic model for computing the optimal purchase, i.e., stockage quantity of an item at an intermediate echelon of supply when repair of the item is possible. For commonly assumed probability distributions of the failure and repair process, it is found that the optimal stockage quantity depends to a large extent on the failure rate and is relatively insensitive to the repair rate. The model is then applied to the problem of determining the extent to which repair is economical at the intermediate echelon. It is concluded that for systems where most items deemed repairable have a low failure rate, the effectiveness of the intermediate echelon may be larger when its primary function is storage rather than repair.

## 5. An Alternative to Monte Carlo Sampling in Stochastic Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
The computer resource requirements of Monte Carlo sampling are a serious deterrent to its use in some instances. In such applications as large-scale planning systems which must combine forecast information from many products, processes, and markets, the extensive use of random sampling can become the principal roadblock to further expansion, especially if interactive timesharing applications are indicated. In this paper, we present an alternative scheme for approximating the probability distribution of sums, differences, products, and quotients of independent random variables whose 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles are specified in advance.

## 6. A Geometric Programming Model for Optimal Allocation of Stream Dissolved Oxygen
### Author(s):
- J. G. Ecker
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
A nonlinear model is developed for allocating treatment requirements along a stream so as to meet stream dissolved oxygen standards at each point in the stream while minimizing the total annual cost of all discharging activities. An application of the model to several reaches of the Upper Hudson River is considered, and some alternative pollution abatement policies are analyzed.

## 7. Achieving Organizational Consensus with Respect to R&D Project Selection Criteria
### Author(s):
- William E. Souder
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
An impact method for achieving organizational consensus was used in specifying R&D project selection criteria at four different organizations. The method consists of the repeated use of a paired comparison instrument, with group discussions and member interactions. High levels of shared values, consensus and member satisfactions were achieved at two of the four organizations. Legitimized leadership, a willingness to engage in confrontations and a high awareness of the larger needs of the total organization existed at these two. By contrast, in the other two organizations the absence of a single strong leader and a clear unity of purpose inhibited consensus. It was concluded that the impact method may be generally useful for disclosing hidden value conflicts. However, the achievement of high levels of shared values and decision consensus may be inhibited where either a strong central leader is lacking or where individuals are unclear about the nature of the larger goals of the total organization.

## 8. A Bayesian Technique to Discriminate between Stochastic Models of Brand Choice
### Author(s):
- Robert C. Blattberg
- Subrata K. Sen
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
This paper describes a Bayesian model-discrimination procedure which determines for each consumer the stochastic model of brand choice which is best supported by his purchasing behavior. The Bayesian technique is illustrated by means of two Markov models and two Bernoulli models. We first discuss in some detail how we set priors for the four models. Then we use simulated consumer panel data to demonstrate that the Bayesian technique is a good discriminator among the four models. The technique is then applied to some actual aluminum foil purchase data. We provide estimates of the proportion of aluminum foil consumers in each of the four model segments and the degree to which the size of each segment changes over time. We also show that model discrimination at the individual consumer level has important implications for market segmentation, pricing, and promotion.

## 9. Diffuse Decision-Making in Hierarchical Organizations: An Empirical Examination
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
The applied research resource allocation decision process in a complex, hierarchical federal organization is explored in this paper. This decision process includes the identification of research objectives and the funding of projects selected to achieve the objectives. The hierarchical, geographical, and temporal diffuseness of participation in the decision process is described. Several a priori conjectures are presented concerning how the decision to fund research projects might be made in such a hierarchically and spatially diffused organization. The conjectures are empirically tested using data for 181 projects from the 1970 budget cycle, and their implications are discussed.

## 10. Statistical Evaluation of Complex Gaming Performance
### Author(s):
- Herbert H. Hand
- Henry P. Sims, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1975
### Abstract:
Past practices in measuring performance in complex management games are reviewed. Focus is directed to the controversy of objective measurement of profitability versus decision and analysis input evaluation. As a middle ground between these extremes, a multi-dimensional approach to the evaluation problem was developed for teams competing in a simulation game. Multi-dimensional performance criteria provide a means to increase learning effectiveness by reducing feedback ambiguity and providing a vehicle for the student to understand the cause-effect relationships inherent in the game and the business environment. This paper describes the development and usage of thirteen performance criteria, and also utilizes the technique of path analysis to investigate the relationships among the performance variables. The results of the path analysis indicated both that teams which forecasted accurately were top performers in terms of profitability and that a consistent and logical relationship existed among the performance variables. These findings, though an indirect measure, contribute to confidence in the internal construct validity of the game.
