## 1. Flight Scheduling and Maintenance Base Planning
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
In an effort to control costs, airlines have begun to concentrate on their maintenance operations as a potential source for savings. Nevertheless, federal regulations and internal safety policies effectively limit cost savings to improvements in productivity and scheduling. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be used by planners to both locate maintenance stations and to develop flight schedules that better meet the cyclical demand for maintenance. The problem is formulated as a min-cost, multicommodity flow network with integral constraints, and solved using a two-phase heuristic.

## 2. Rounding Off to Powers of Two in Continuous Relaxations of Capacitated Lot Sizing Problems
### Author(s):
- Robin Roundy
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
In the capacitated version of the Divide and Conquer algorithm for lot sizing in multi-stage production/inventory problems, feasibility is often lost when the reorder intervals are rounded off to powers of two. We propose a new algorithm for rounding off the reorder intervals which always produces a feasible policy. We have shown that the relative increase in cost that occurs when the intervals are rounded off using this algorithm cannot exceed 44%, and that for systems with a single capacity machine (including the ELSP), the cost increase cannot exceed 6%. Computational experience with industrial data sets indicates that the algorithm performs very well.

## 3. Multi-Level Production and Distribution Planning with Transportation Fleet Optimization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
We present an application of mathematical programming for solving a complex multi-level production and distribution network optimization problem faced by a petrochemical company. Two liquified petroleum gas (LPG) products, propane and butane, are produced at refineries, from where they are shipped in bulk to plants for bottling. Then the company distributes the gas bottles to the customers either directly or via depots and transportation breakpoints. Transportation is carried out by the company's own truck fleet or by contract carriers. The own trucks can operate on different shift systems allowing for overtime. The problem is to find the location of the bottling plants and the depots, the production levels at the refineries and the plants, the stock levels at the plants and the depots, the transportation volumes on each link of the distribution network, the number of trucks and drivers, the transportation shift systems and schedules, and the customer assignments so as to meet LPG demand at minimal cost. The actual problem has 2 commodities, 2 refineries, 10 potential bottling plant locations, 40 potential depot locations, 40 breakpoints (transporters), and 200 customer regions. The problem was solved using a matrix generator designed for network-like problems and MPSARX, a state-of-the-art general-purpose mathematical programming software system augmented with advanced automatic reformulation and cut generation features.

## 4. Replenishment Delays for Expensive Slow-Moving Items
### Author(s):
- Carl R. Schultz
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
Traditional single-item inventory control policies operating under continuous review call for the immediate placement of a replenishment order each time a demand causes the inventory position to drop to or below the order point. In an environment where lead times are small relative to the average time between demands, and holding costs are large relative to other inventory costs, it may be more economical to delay ordering to achieve holding cost savings with little additional risk or cost of shortages.

## 5. Expected Waiting Time for Nonsymmetric Cyclic Queueing SystemsExact Results and Applications
### Author(s):
- D. Sarkar
- W. I. Zangwill
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
This paper provides the expected waiting time of a nonsymmetric cyclic server queueing system with Poisson traffic, arbitrary switchover and arbitrary service times. For n the number of queues, the expected waiting time is obtained using n equations which is a significant improvement over the previous best result which requires solution of n2 equations. Computer, manufacturing and other applications are discussed.

## 6. Sensitivity Analysis from Sample Paths Using Likelihoods
### Author(s):
- Philip Heidelberger
- Don Towsley
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
We modify the likelihood-based method for obtaining derivatives with respect to the rate of a Poisson process to that it is not necessary to know the exact value of that rate. This type of modification is necessary if the method is to be used on a sample path from a real system. The method is also applicable to simulation studies of certain real time control policies and may be useful in trace driven simulations. The modification to the likelihood estimator is simply to use the value of the Poisson rate estimated during the sample interval. For regenerative systems, this produces a strongly consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically unbiased estimate of the derivative. The strong law and central limit theorem are generalized to the case of estimating a derivative with respect to an unknown parameter from the exponential class of probability density functions. Numerical results for the M/M/1 queue illustrate little difference between the estimates for the derivative of the expected delay with respect to arrival rate obtained when the arrival rate is known and unknown. However, both estimates are highly biased for small sample sizes. This bias can be reduced by jackknifing.

## 7. An Empirical Test of a Stage of Growth Progression Model
### Author(s):
- Robert K. Kazanjian
- Robert Drazin
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
This paper presents a stage of growth model for technology based new ventures (TBNVs). TBNVs are postulated to evolve through four discrete stages of growthConception and Development, Commercialization, Growth, and Stability. Based on a longitudinal sample of 71 ventures in the computer and electronics industries, the hypothesis that TBNVs progress according to this model is tested using the del procedure for prediction analysis of cross-classification tables. The hypotheses are supported, although not all firms progressed as expected. These results suggest that some variation in interstage transition patterns are due to a progression imperative.

## 8. Asset Stock Accumulation and Sustainability of Competitive Advantage
### Author(s):
- Ingemar Dierickx
- Karel Cool
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
Given incomplete factor markets, appropriate time paths of flow variables must be chosen to build required stocks of assets. That is, critical resources are accumulated rather than acquired in strategic factor markets (Barney [Barney, J. 1986. Strategic factor markets: Expectations, luck, and business strategy. Management Sci. (October) 12311241.]). Sustainability of a firm's asset position hinges on how easily assets can be substituted or imitated. Imitability is linked to the characteristics of the asset accumulation process: time compression diseconomies, asset mass efficiencies, inter-connectedness, asset erosion and causal ambiguity.

## 9. Asset Stocks and Sustained Competitive Advantage: A Comment
### Author(s):
- Jay B. Barney
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
In their paper, Dierickx and Cool suggest that the strategic factor markets model developed in Barney (Barney, J. B. 1986a. Strategic factor markets: Expectations, luck, and business strategy. Management Sci. (October) 12311241.) cannot be applied in the analysis of sustained competitive advantages due to asset stocks accumulated over time. In this comment, it is shown that the discussion of asset stocks extends and complements, rather than limits, the strategic factor markets model. This is done by analyzing how the strategic factor markets model can be used to examine the cost of accumulating asset stocks over long periods of time, and how these costs will compare to the value of strategies that are implemented exploiting these asset stocks.

## 12. NoteDeriving the Optimal Boundaries for Class-Based Automatic Storage/Retrieval Systems
### Author(s):
- Meir J. Rosenblatt
- Amit Eynan
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1989
### Abstract:
The optimal boundaries for class-based AS/RS systems are determined. A solution procedure is developed which requires only a one-dimensional search procedure. It is shown that most of the potential improvement in the expected one-way travel time can be obtained when the warehouse is divided into a relatively small number of regions. Thus, there is no need to use the full-turnover approach, which is difficult to implement.
