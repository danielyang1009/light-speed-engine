## 1. A Discrepancy Model of End-User Computing Involvement

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
Within the context of traditional data processing, the MIS literature has devoted considerable attention to the relationship between user involvement and MIS success: unfortunately, this research has produced conflicting results. After reviewing these results, Ives and Olson provide a framework for research on user involvement. Although their framework uses cognitive and motivational psychological mechanisms to explain the linkage between user involvement and MIS success, the contingency variables they identify do not pertain to individual differences between users. Thus, the framework has limitations that reduce its usefulness for explaining conflicting research findings, and its applicability to the end-user computing environment.

## 2. Group Process and Conflict in System Development

### Abstract:
Information system development projects engage organizational members in a process with potential for conflict. Managing such conflicts in project groups is an important but often neglected aspect of systems development. This research assesses group process during the development of an information system in an insurance company, using questionnaires, recorded transcripts of group meetings, interviews, and archival data. We describe the relationships among four variables in a model of conflictparticipation, influence, conflict, and conflict resolutionat five different periods over a 22-month period. Our results show that in every time period participation positively affected influence and that influence positively affected both conflict and conflict resolution. These findings are supported by an analysis of communication patterns within four project meetings and by qualitative data collected during the project. The practical implications of conflict and group processes in system development are discussed.

## 3. Maintaining Project Networks in Automated Artificial Intelligence Planning
### Author(s):
- Colin E. Bell
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
AI automated plan synthesis programs (planners) typically represent plans as a partially ordered network whose nodes are instants in time and whose arcs are precedence constraints. Such representations are essentially PERT charts. This paper provides an introduction to AI planners and illustrates the fact that many such PERT chart representations are created by a planner as it attempts to find a suitable plan. A planner's search must be guided if it is to produce suitable plans in realistic problem domains. One form of guidance is the imposition of constraints which must be satisfied by a valid plan. This paper concentrates on representing and reasoning about such constraints.

## 4. Analyzing Trade-Offs Between Machine Investment and Utilization
### Author(s):
- David J. Vander Veen
- William C. Jordan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
Analyzing machine investment opportunities from a systems perspective requires an understanding of interdependencies between machine investment and utilization decisions. Machine investment decisions involve determining the number of machines to purchase and their types. Machine utilization decisions involve determining part allocations and production cycles. Interdependencies between these decisions result in trade-offs between investment and operating costs.

## 5. Optimizing Profits from a System of Accounts Receivable
### Author(s):
- Robert E. Stanford
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
We develop a model of the period-by-period maintenance cost and interest income accumulation resulting from charges to a system of accounts receivable, and establish conditions under which the present value of the expected profit generated by the charges reaches its greatest attainable levels. The profit measure is expressed as a function of the rate at which active accounts are paid off, which is initially treated as an independent variable, then as a function of the rate of interest charged to the active accounts. In the first case we find that profitable operation of the accounts is possible only if the ratio of the charge amount to the fixed account maintenance cost is no smaller than a specific critical value which is dependent upon the rate at which charges are lost as bad debts, the interest rate charged to active accounts, and the discount rate applied to future payments on the debts. In this case the lowest allowable payoff rate maximizes the present value of expected profits. If the payoff rate is allowed to increase with the interest rate, creating a condition of decreasing marginal efficiency of increases in the interest rate, both the income-maximizing interest rate and its associated payoff rate may occur at nonextreme values within the range of definition of these measures. The form of our model and its analysis have much in common with the Optimal Dividends Problem investigated in the Finance literature.

## 6. A Bivariate First-Order Autoregressive Time Series Model in Exponential Variables (BEAR(1))
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
A simple time series model for bivariate exponential variables having first-order autoregressive structure is presented, the BEAR(1) model. The linear random coefficient difference equation model is an adaptation of the New Exponential Autoregressive model (NEAR(2)). The process is Markovian in the bivariate sense and has correlation structure analogous to that of the Gaussian AR(1) bivariate time series model. The model exhibits a full range of positive correlations and cross-correlations. With some modification in either the innovation or the random coefficients, the model admits some negative values for the cross-correlations. The marginal processes are shown to have correlation structure of ARMA(2, 1) models.

## 7. Project Scope and Project Performance: The Effect of Parts Strategy and Supplier Involvement on Product Development
### Author(s):
- Kim B. Clark
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
This paper examines the effect on product development of project scope: the extent to which a new product is based on unique parts developed in-house. Using data from a larger study of product development in the world auto industry, the paper presents evidence on the impact of scope on lead time and engineering productivity. Studies of the automotive supplier industry suggest that very different structures and relationships exist in Japan, the U.S., and Europe. Yet there has been little study of the impact of these differences on development performance. Further, little is known about the effects of different parts strategies (i.e. unique versus common or carryover parts) on development. The evidence presented here suggests that project scope differs significantly in the industry, even for comparable products. These differences in strategy, in turn, explain an important part of differences in performance. In particular, it appears that a distinctive approach to scope among Japanese firmshigh levels of unique parts, intensive supplier involvement in engineeringaccounts for a significant fraction of their advantage in lead time and cost.

## 8. Cost Allocation Revisited: An Optimality Result
### Author(s):
- Seungjin Whang
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1989
### Abstract:
The resource manager of a firm is faced with capacity and pricing decisions with regard to a congestion-prone system such as computer/communication facilities. Difficulties arise since the manager is uninformed of the system demand when the capacity decision is to be made. A game-theoretic model is developed to analyze the effects of different accounting rules on the elicitation of relevant information and ex-post efficiency in acquisition and allocation decisions. The key result is that the cost allocation method (aided by an anonymous reporting scheme) is indeed, as asserted by Zimmerman (Zimmerman, J. 1979. The costs and benefits of cost allocations. Accounting Rev.54(July) 504521.), a full-information-efficient rule achieving optimality both in acquisition and allocation decisions. Discussions of the main assumptions underlying this result are provided.
