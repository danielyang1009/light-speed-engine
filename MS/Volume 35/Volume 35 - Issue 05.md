## 1. Depreciation Policies in Regulated Companies: Which Policies are the Most Efficient?
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Decisions of firms such as whether to purchase new equipment frequently rather than better maintain and purchase less frequently are influenced by the (accounting) depreciation policies they use if they are rate-regulated. It is shown that basing decisions on depreciation policies, while uneconomic without regulation, might become rational under regulation. Regulators can mandate depreciation policies for these firms. This paper identifies a class of depreciation rules which will eliminate management incentives to make uneconomic capital replacement and maintenance decisions under regulation.

## 2. Gaussian Influence Diagrams
### Author(s):
- Ross D. Shachter
- C. Robert Kenley
### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
An influence diagram is a network representation of probabilistic inference and decision analysis models. The nodes correspond to variables that can be either constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and information available at the time of the decisions. The influence diagram focuses attention on relationships among the variables. As a result, it is increasingly popular for eliciting and communicating the structure of a decision or probabilistic model.

## 3. On the Maintenance of Systems Composed of Highly Reliable Components
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
We consider the dynamic repair allocation problem for a general multi-component system that is maintained by a limited number of repairmen. Component functioning and repair times are exponentially distributed random variables with known parameters. At most one repairman may be assigned to a failed component and it is possible to reassign a repairman from one failed component to another instantaneously. The objective is to determine repair allocation policies that maximize a measure of performance of the system such as the expected discounted system operation time or the availability of the system. We consider systems composed of highly reliable, i.e., small failure rates, components and study asymptotic techniques for the determination of optimal policies. In the final section we find asymptotically optimal policies for the series, parallel, and a system composed of parallel subsystems connected in series.

## 4. The M/M/1 Queue with Randomly Varying Arrival and Service Rates: A Phase Substitution Solution
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
This paper presents an alternative procedure for computing the steady state probability vector of an M/M/1 queue with randomly varying arrival and service rates. By exploiting the structure of the infinitesimal generator of the underlying continuous-time Markov chain, the approach represents an efficient adaptation of the state reduction method introduced by Grassmann for solving problems involving M/M/1 queues under a random environment. We compare computational requirements of the proposed approach with the method of Neuts and block elimination under different rush-hour congestion patterns while keeping the overall traffic intensity constant as well as under different traffic intensities. We demonstrate that the proposed method requires minimal computing time to reach convergence and moreover the time requirement does not change much when traffic intensity increases.

## 5. Open Order Due Date Maintenance in MRP Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the problem of maintaining open order due dates in job shops that plan and schedule their operations using Material Requirements Planning (MRP) methodology. Two different techniques for dealing with open order due date changes are analyzed using customer service level and total inventory level performance measures. With the first technique, called the fixed due date approach, due dates are never changed from those originally assigned to orders when released to the shop. With the second technique, called the dynamic due date approach, all due dates are updated to reflect actual need dates. Beyond evaluating them in an MRP context, this study extends current understanding of these two techniques by observing them in a variety of different operating environments. The results of the study indicate that: (1) the dynamic due date approach performs as good as, or better than, the fixed due date approach across a wide range of operating conditions; and (2) operating conditions have an important effect on the magnitude of the performance differential between the two approaches.

## 6. Uncertainty and Leontief Systems: An Application to the Selection of Space Station System Designs
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
This paper deals with the problem of designing a critical component of a highly interactive technologically advanced system, one in which there is uncertainty as to technological and cost parameters. The particular example discussed in the paper is the choice of an energy module for Space Station, where two alternatives, PV and SD, were under consideration. If the uncertainty associated with technological and cost parameters were ignored, and a choice made solely on the basis of best guesses of NASA engineers as to parameter values, then SD, which has been implemented only in small scale laboratory applications, would be a clearcut design to cost winner. The situation is different when the best guess estimates are replaced by subjective probability distributions over technological and cost parameters. The paper outlines a safety first decision making model which suggests that the more reliable PV, which has been used on all previous space missions, becomes the preferred choice for highly risk averse decision makers.

## 7. Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics
### Author(s):
- Arshad M. Khan

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
This study addresses the proposition that the characteristics of innovative and noninnovative small firms have significant differences. It is based on a sample of 50 Texas manufacturers. Cluster analysis yielded five distinct groupstwo innovative and three noninnovative. The two innovative groups were either young firms dubbed the Young Turks, or, established, managerially competent firms headed by newcomers called the Blue Chips. Among the three noninnovative groups, the Silver Spoons appeared to be surviving on past success; the Striving Stoics displayed continuing managerial effort but were led by executives who had been at the helm far longer than average; and the Kismets showed lesser competence and effort, were highly centralized, and were headed by executives tending more towards an external locus of control. Correlational analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between scanning and innovation. Challenges to the firm in the form of environmental dynamism and heterogeneity evoked positive innovatory responses but environmental hostility was a weak negative correlate inducing the firm to pull in its horns. Finally, an abundance of resources encouraged proactiveness.

## 8. Batching to Minimize Flow Times on Parallel Heterogeneous Machines
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
Traditional scheduling models have emphasized sequencing of tasks at machines. At multiple-machine work-centers mean flow times are affected by the allocation of work to machines, as well as the batch-sizes used for processing. An efficient algorithm for computing the optimal solution for the single product case is given. An approximate closed-form solution is available that could be used as a heuristic loading-rule in a dynamic environment. For the special case of equal setup times at machines, the optimal solution is given in closed form. Further, it is demonstrated that the optimal flow time for the work center depends only on the total processing rate at that center.

## 9. An N Server Cutoff Priority Queue Where Arriving Customers Request a Random Number of Servers
### Author(s):
- Christian Schaack
- Richard C. Larson
### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
We consider a multi-priority, N-server, Poisson arrival, nonpreemptive queue, motivated by police applications. The number of servers requested by an arrival has a known priority dependent probability distribution. All servers requested by a customer must start service simultaneously; the servers' service times are independent and exponentially distributed with parameter , independent of priority, server identity or system state. In order to save available servers for higher priority customers, arriving customers of each lower priority are deliberately queued whenever the number of servers busy equals or exceeds a given priority-dependent cutoff number. Whenever all higher priority queues are empty, the longest waiting priority i customer will enter service the instant there is a service completion from a state having precisely Ni  k + 1 servers busy, where k is the number of servers requested by the customer and Ni is the server cutoff number for priority i. The queueing discipline is in a sense HOL by priorities. We derive the priority i waiting time distribution (in transform domain) and other system statistics. Illustrative computational results are given.

## 10. NoteA Note on the Dynamic Lot-Size Model with Uncertainty in Demand and Supply Processes
### Author(s):
- E. J. Anderson
### Published:
- 1 May 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper we give some extensions of a result of Nevison and Burstein (Nevison, C. H., M. Burstein. 1984. The dynamic lot-size model with stochastic lead times. Management Sci.30 100109.), who discuss a dynamic lot-sizing model with stochastic lead times. They consider a situation in which the lead time distribution is unaltered by the amount which is ordered, but is otherwise arbitrary, and characterize the optimal solution in terms of points at which there is zero inventory. Here we give a more precise characterization, and show that these results can be extended to a situation in which the demands are also stochastic, and in which there is uncertainty relating to quantity as well as to the timing of demands and order arrivals. The method of proof that we use is different from that used by Nevison and Burstein.
