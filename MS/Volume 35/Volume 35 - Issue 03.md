## 1. Characterizations of Optimal Portfolios by Univariate and Multivariate Risk Aversion
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
In a portfolio selection model with two risky investments having bivariate normally distributed returns, we show that Rubinstein's measures of risk aversion can yield the desirable characterizations of risk aversion and wealth effects on the optimal portfolios. These properties are analogous to those of the Arrow-Pratt measures of risk aversion in the portfolio selection model with one riskless and one risky investment. If investors' preferences are represented by multi-attributed utility functions and returns on different investments and other relevant factors have a joint normal distribution, we show that optimal portfolios can be characterized by a matrix measure of risk aversion.

## 2. Discount Rates Inferred from Decisions: An Experimental Study

### Published:

### Abstract:
Two hundred and four students of economics and finance participated in an intertemporal choice experiment which manipulated three dimensions in a 4  4  4 factorial design: scenario (postponing a receipt, postponing a payment, expediting a receipt, expediting a payment), time delay (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 years), and size of cashflow ($40, $200, $1000, and $5000). Individual discount rates were inferred from the responses, and then used to test competitively four hypotheses regarding the behavior of discount rates. The classical hypothesis asserting that the discount rate is uniform across scenarios, time delays, and sums of cashflow was flatly rejected. A market segmentation approach was found lacking. The results support an implicit risk hypothesis according to which delayed consequences are associated with an implicit risk value, and an added compensation hypothesis which asserts that individuals require compensation for a change in their financial position.

## 3. The Effect of Task Demands and Graphical Format on Information Processing Strategies
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
The designers of decision support systems lack theoretically based principles for designing graphical interfaces. The purpose of the reported research is to take a step toward developing such principles for graphical information presentation formats. Specifically, this paper presents an investigation of the effects of graphical formats and task demands upon decision processes and decision outcomes. In a laboratory setting, research participants made choices under differing task and graphical format conditions, and their information acquisition and evaluation behaviors were recorded. The results suggest that information presentation format influences the decision time and the selection of acquisition and evaluation strategies by influencing the cognitive costs and benefits of the task environment. Other factors influencing the decision time and the choice of strategies include the characteristics of the task and the interactions between the presentation format and the other task demands. The interactions between the task demands and the graphical format appear to be complex and may impact different stages of decision process differently (e.g., acquisition versus evaluation). The findings of the current study extend the results of previous studies on information format into the domain of graphical displays. The findings also suggest that the cognitive cost/benefit framework can provide a robust theoretical foundation for design decisions regarding graphical presentation formats in decision support systems.

## 4. Product Assortment in a Triopoly
### Author(s):
- Steven M. Shugan
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
Producers of super-premium ice cream, such as Hagen-Dazs, offer a smaller assortment of flavors than the producers of lesser quality ice cream. Examples of this phenomenon can be found in other industries as well. In many industries, the producers of higher-quality products offer a smaller assortment of flavors, colors, sizes, patterns, textures, fragrances, tones, styles, models, designs, types or other options. This paper explores when and why producers of super-premium products should find it profitable to offer a smaller assortment than the producers of nonpremium products. We derive a Nash equilibrium both on prices and product assortments for a triopoly. At the Nash equilibrium, we show that additional product quality, increased consumer price-sensitivity and greater assortment costs discourages product assortment. We also show that a larger market potential, greater competitive costs and sharper competition encourage more assortment by the super-premium producer.

## 5. Modeling Managerial Behavior: Misperceptions of Feedback in a Dynamic Decision Making Experiment
### Author(s):
- John D. Sterman
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
Studies in the psychology of individual choice have identified numerous cognitive and other bounds on human rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases. Yet for the most part models of aggregate phenomena in management science and economics are not consistent with such micro-empirical knowledge of individual decision-making. One explanation has been the difficulty of extending the experimental methods used to study individual decisions to aggregate, dynamic settings. This paper reports an experiment on the generation of macrodynamics from microstructure in a common managerial context. Subjects manage a simulated inventory distribution system which contains multiple actors, feedbacks, nonlinearities, and time delays. The interaction of individual decisions with the structure of the simulated firm produces aggregate dynamics which systematically diverge from optimal behavior. An anchoring and adjustment heuristic for stock management is proposed as a model of the subjects' decision processes. Econometric tests show the rule explains the subjects' behavior well. The estimation results identify several misperceptions of feedback which account for the poor performance of the subjects. In particular, subjects are shown to be insensitive to the feedbacks from their decisions to the environment. Finally, the generality of the results is considered and implications for behavioral theories of aggregate social and economic dynamics are explored.

## 6. Forgetting and the Learning Curve: A Laboratory Study
### Author(s):
- Charles D. Bailey
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
The industrial learning curve is widely used to predict costs and labor requirements wherever learning is taking place. Little is known, however, about the reverse of this process: the forgetting that occurs during production interruptions. The ability to estimate cost increases due to forgetting would be useful for economic lot size determinations, bidding on repeat orders, estimating the cost of strikes, and so on.

## 8. Implicit Treatment of Zero or Range Constraints in a Model for Minimum Cost Foundry Alloys
### Author(s):
- P. Hansen
- J. Hug
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
A major problem in foundries is to select scrap alloys and pure metals in order to produce at minimum cost alloy of specified composition. We show that such problems, of realistic size, can be solved optimally by mixed-integer programming. Constraints are that the content of the alloys in various metals must be within given ranges and that the selected amount of each scrap alloy must be either zero or within a given range. The latter zero or range constraints can be treated implicitly in a similar way as lower and upper bounds are treated implicitly in bounded variables linear programming. Computation times for representative problems are thus reduced by a factor of three.

## 9. NoteSeasonal Exponential Smoothing with Damped Trends
### Author(s):
- Everette S. Gardner, Jr.
- Ed. McKenzie
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper we apply the strategy of trend-damping to the popular Winters exponential smoothing systems for seasonal time series. Efficient model formulations are derived for both multiplicative and additive seasonal patterns. An algorithm is given to test the stability of the models in cases where predetermined smoothing parameters are used. Empirical results are presented to show that trend-damping improves ex ante forecast accuracy in seasonal data, especially at long leadtimes.

## 10. NoteDeveloping a Global Diversification Measure
### Author(s):
- W. Chan Kim
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1989
### Abstract:
Previous measures, focusing on either the international market or product dimension of corporate diversification, have been unsatisfactory for analyzing global diversification since both dimensions constitute important elements of a firm's global diversification strategy. This study constructs a measure in which both dimensions can be captured, allowing business strategy researchers to examine corporate diversification in the global context. In accomplishing this task, this study extends the Jacquemin-Berry entropy diversification measure to the global horizon.
