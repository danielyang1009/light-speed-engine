## 1. Foundations of Decision Analysis: Along the Way
### Author(s):
- Peter C. Fishburn
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
This paper offers a personal perspective on the development of decision theory and related subjects during the past half century. It first reviews six milestones in the foundations of decision analysis that are associated with Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, Leonard J. Savage, Maurice Allais and Ward Edwards, West Churchman and Russell Ackoff, and Kenneth Arrow. It then gives a personal account of further developments over the past 30 years in linear utility theory, subjective probability and ambiguity, nonlinear preference and utility, stochastic dominance and inequality analysis, multiattribute utility theory, and the theory of social choice.

## 2. Bias in Utility Assessments: Further Evidence and Explanations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
Judgments about simple gambles, such as those used in utility assessment, can generate sizable and systematic bias. After Hershey and Schoemaker (Hershey, J. C., P. J. H. Schoemaker. 1985. Probability vs. certainty equivalence methods in utility measurement: Are they equivalent? Management Sci.31 12131231.), we employ both the probability and certainty equivalence methods to explore bias. Our results show that: (1) the direction and degree of bias depend on characteristics of the assessment gamble such as the reference probability and the difference between outcomes, (2) presenting subjects with explicit anchors can change the size and direction of the bias, and (3) subjects using heuristic response strategies show significantly more bias than those using expectation strategies. We also discuss the status of possible explanations for the bias, in light of these new results, including PE mode reframing, random error, and anchoring and adjustment.

## 3. Market Reaction to Quarterly Earnings' Announcements: A Stochastic Dominance Based Test of Market Efficiency
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
The use of the CAPM in empirical research is subject to some criticism. In light of this criticism the Stochastic Dominance criteria are offered as an alternative research method for the examination of market efficiency. The underlying assumptions of the two frameworks are discussed and the Stochastic Dominance technique is demonstrated via the examination of market reaction to quarterly earnings announcements during the 24 quarters commencing with October 1962. The findings are compared to those of Watts (Watts, R. The Time Series Behavior of Quarterly Earnings. Unpublished Paper, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, N.S.W. 1975, quoted in Watts [1978].) who utilized the same data base. In contrast to Watts' conclusion, our analysis suggests that the market was efficient during the entire period examined and that no significant differences in market behavior between the first and the second 12-month periods was evident. The discord may be attributed to the relative effectiveness of the two analytical tools and some differences in the research designs.

## 4. A Dynamic Lot-Size Model with Make-or-Buy Decisions
### Author(s):
- Sang-Bum Lee
- Paul H. Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
This paper considers a dynamic lot-size model with make-or-buy decisions. In each period, the production level may not exceed a given capacity, but the purchase is unrestricted. The costs for production, purchase and inventory are concave. The problem is to find a minimum-cost production and purchase schedule that satisfies known demands over T periods. After characterizing the form of an optimal solution, we present an O(T5) algorithm when the production capacities are stationary. The algorithm is extended to the case where the capacities are integer multiples of a constant. The results are further extended to the cases of backlogging, bounded inventory, and capacitated purchase.

## 5. A Dynamic Programming Approach to Stochastic Assembly Line Balancing
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Carraway
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
Consider the problem of minimizing the required number of work stations on an assembly line for a given cycle time when the processing times are independent, normally distributed random variables. The assignment of tasks to stations is subject to precedence conditions, caused by technological constraints, and a lower bound on the probability of the work at any station being completed within the cycle time. We present two dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for this problem, each guaranteed to be optimal under a certain mild condition. Our general approach is based on the Held et al. (Held, M., R. M. Karp, R. Shareshian. 1963. Assembly-line-balancing-dynamic programming with precedence constraints. Oper. Res.11 442459.) formulation of the deterministic line balancing problem and thus represents a modification of previous work by Kao (Kao, E. P. C. 1976. A preference order dynamic program for stochastic assembly line balancing. Management Sci.22 10971104.). Computational results indicate that both algorithms significantly outperform an alternative DP approach suggested by Henig (Henig, M. I. 1986. Extensions of the dynamic programming method in the deterministic and stochastic assembly-line balancing problems. Comput. Oper. Res.13 443449.).

## 6. Operating Characteristics of the (S  1, S) Inventory System with Partial Backorders and Constant Resupply Times
### Author(s):
- Kamran Moinzadeh
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider an (S  1, S) inventory system with Poisson demand and constant resupply times. An arriving customer facing stockout will either backorder or withdraw its order. Expressions describing steady state operating characteristics of the system and the expected total cost rate are developed. Furthermore, the behavior of the expected total cost rate as the function of the relevant parameters is explored.

## 7. A General Framework for Modeling Production
### Author(s):
- Steven T. Hackman
- Robert C. Leachman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
We introduce a general framework that guides the management scientist's formulation of deterministic models of production processes. Using the framework, we reformulate the constraints of familiar linear programming-based planning models to specifically treat components of production lead time, thereby realizing a more accurate representation of the production process. In addition, the reformulation accommodates noninteger values for lead times as well as unequal-length planning periods. Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRP) and the Critical Path Method (CPM) are recast in terms of the framework, revealing opportunities for model generalization and extension, and their relationship to linear programming models.

## 8. Firm Strategies for Costly Engineering Learning
### Author(s):
- Ashoka Mody
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1989
### Abstract:
The models developed in this paper seek to open up the black-box of learning. I suggest that we need to think of learning-by-doing as a process of knowledge creation on the shop-floor by specialized teams of engineers. Learning is to be viewed, therefore, as a conscious decision and not a mere by-product of production. The models in this paper provide the basis for understanding international and inter-firm differences in rates of learning. For example, cheaper engineering resources, longer time horizons, faster output growth rates and superior transferability of knowledge from engineers to production workers are shown to be some possible factors responsible for faster learning in Japanese firms compared to U.S. firms.
