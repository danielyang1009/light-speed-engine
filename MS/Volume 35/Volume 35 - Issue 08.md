## 1. Knowledge Maps
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
To get fragmented information out of people's heads, onto paper, and ultimately into a computer is a continually challenging problem. We show how to use the concepts of influence diagrams to construct knowledge maps that capture the diverse information possessed by an individual or a group. We use redundant knowledge maps assessed iteratively to handle cases where the most comfortable way to assess the information does not correspond to any proper assessment order for the diagram. We use disjoint knowledge maps when the particular assessment to be made does not require a complete joint distribution. The necessary inferential calculations are readily performed in simple cases by spreadsheet programs. Knowledge maps facilitate the processes of representing knowledge and of determining its implications.

## 2. Generalized Assignment with Nonlinear Capacity Interaction
### Author(s):
- Joseph B. Mazzola
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1989
### Abstract:
The utility of the generalized assignment problem (GAP) is well known in regard to resource allocation problems arising in the areas of production planning, scheduling, and facility location. This paper introduces an important generalization of the GAP, which is called the 0-1 generalized assignment problem with nonlinear capacity constraints (NLGAP) and which allows for capacity interaction among tasks assigned to the same agent. For example, NLGAP can be used to model the hierarchical production planning problem involving the assignment of product families to production facilities in the case where process changeover gives rise to nonlinear capacity interaction among product families assigned to be produced at the same facility. Other applications of NLGAP occur readily throughout the areas of production planning and scheduling.

## 3. Strategic Orientation of Business Enterprises: The Construct, Dimensionality, and Measurement
### Author(s):
- N. Venkatraman
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1989
### Abstract:
This paper reports the results of a research study aimed at conceptualizing and developing valid measurements of key dimensions of a strategy constructtermed Strategic Orientation of Business Enterprises. This construct is first defined by addressing four theoretical questions of scope; hierarchical level; domain; and intentions versus realizations, and then conceptualized in terms of six dimensions. Subsequently, operational indicators are developed for the six dimensions in terms of managerial perceptions across 200 business units in a field study. An evaluation of the measurement properties within an analysis of covariance structures framework indicated that the operational measures developed here largely satisfy the criteria for unidimensionality, convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. Implications and lines of extensions are outlined.

## 4. Defining Managerial Problems: A Framework for Prescriptive Theorizing
### Author(s):
- Gerald F. Smith
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1989
### Abstract:
Reflective problem solving activity presumes the existence of a problem definition or representation, often the precursor of a formal model. Although problem definition has been addressed by theorists from several disciplines, it has not been adequately conceptualized, limiting the potential value of descriptive and prescriptive research. This article places problem definition in the overall problem solving process and delineates the various ways in which problems are commonly defined. It identifies the central dilemma of problem definition and proposes a prescriptive framework responding to that dilemma.

## 5. User Acceptance of Computer Technology: A Comparison of Two Theoretical Models

### Abstract:
Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.

## 6. On Optimal Production and the Market to Book Ratio Given Limited Shareholder Diversification
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1989
### Abstract:
Our purpose is to examine a firm's optimal output decision and valuation when its shareholders hold a limited number of risky assets. The primary theoretical result indicates that the market-to-book ratio is a function of the degree of shareholder diversification. Our theory suggests a negative relationship between a firm's market-to-book ratio and shareholder diversification.

## 7. Technological Infrastructure and the Implementation of Technological Strategies
### Author(s):
- Andrew R. Weiss
- Philip H. Birnbaum
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1989
### Abstract:
Technological change is an important strategic problem for many enterprises. Effectively implementing the technological aspects of a firm's strategy requires an understanding of the nature of the external infrastructure which supports technological change and the strategic capability to continuously interact with this infrastructure. After explaining why this infrastructure is important and how it is organized, we suggest the basic elements needed to implement a technological strategy successfully.
