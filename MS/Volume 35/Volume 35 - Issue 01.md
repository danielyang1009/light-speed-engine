## 1. Airline Safety: The Last Decade
### Author(s):
- Arnold Barnett
- Mary K. Higgins
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
The paper presents safety data for the period 197786 from more than 30 U.S. domestic airlines and 80 international flag carriers. These statistics are examined in conjunction with others from an earlier MIT study about the previous two decades. The primary safety measure used is death risk per flight, which weights each fatal accident by the proportion of passengers killed and exploits statistical evidence that the risk arising from a nonstop flight is uncorrelated with its route length.

## 2. Prospect Versus Utility
### Author(s):
- Imran S. Currim
- Rakesh K. Sarin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
We show how to calibrate a prospect model of decision making under risk for an individual. The prospect model is empirically compared to a utility model on two criteria, verification of the postulates of each model, and predictive accuracy. The empirical comparison is performed via three experiments. In Experiment 1, predictive accuracy of the models is compared in nonparadoxical situations, those which favor neither model. In contrast the predictions in Experiment 2 are for paradoxical choices, those which favor the prospect model. In Experiment 1, the prospect model is compared to a model comprising a utility function which permits separate risk attitudes for gain and losses, and hence is more flexible than a utility model as traditionally assessed. In contrast the utility model in Experiment 3 is assessed as is traditionally done assuming constant risk attitude across gains and losses. Several calibration procedures are contrasted across experiments.

## 3. Estimation Uncertainty and Optimal Advertising Decisions

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a normative model that is built on an empirically relevant foundation. We observe that decision makers, among them advertisers, rely on estimated relationships in reaching resource allocation decisions, and we investigate the normative implications of this process. In particular, we explore the effects of uncertainty stemming from the use of sample estimates of population parameters. In general, we find that ignoring this estimation-related uncertainty leads to suboptimal decisions.

## 4. On Stochastic Dominance and Decreasing Absolute Risk Averse Option Pricing Bounds
### Author(s):
- Peter Ritchken
- Shyanjaw Kuo
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
Merton, Perrakis and Ryan, Levy, and Ritchken have established option pricing bounds under first and second stochastic dominance preferences. These bounds are particularly important for valuing contingent claims when continuous trading in the claim and/or underlying security does not exist. This article provides option bounds under higher orders of dominance. Specifically, option bounds are obtained by solving mathematical programs where preference structures on prices are represented by constraints. For first, second, third and higher orders of stochastic dominance preferences, the special linear structure of the mathematical programs allow analytical solutions to be obtained for the bounds. For DARA preferences, third order stochastic dominance, while being necessary, is not sufficient and additional constraints must be imposed. Unfortunately these additional constraints are nonlinear. While in this case closed form analytical solutions for the option bounds are not obtained, numerical examples are presented to illustrate their strength.

## 5. Choosing Between Risky Prospects: The Characterization of Comparative Statics Results, and Location Independent Risk
### Author(s):
- Ian Jewitt
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
We consider expected utility maximizers choosing from a family of risky prospects and examine how choice is influenced by the decision makers attitude to risk. If the family of risky prospects can be ordered so that as decision makers are more risk tolerant they choose a gamble higher in the ordering, then it is natural to say that the family of risky prospects admit a comparative static result. The paper characterizes when comparative static results of this sort exist. An application is to propose a criterion of location independent riskiness.

## 6. Critical Number Policies for Inventory Models with Periodic Data
### Author(s):
- Paul Zipkin
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
We consider an infinite-horizon in problem with stochastic demands where the data vary periodically. Karlin (Karlin, S. 1960a. Dynamic inventory policy with varying stochastic demands. Management Sci.6 231258; Karlin, S. 1960b. Optimal policy for dynamic inventory process with stochastic demands subject to seasonal variations. J. SIAM8 611629.) shows that a periodic critical-number policy is optimal and presents an algorithm for computing the critical numbers, assuming discounted costs. Here we develop an alternative, conceptually simpler approach to these problems. The results include a proof of the optimality of such policies for the average-cost case, and a qualitative description of the behavior of the optimal policy as smoothing fluctuations in the data.

### Published:

### Abstract:
A survey of more than 4,000 significant innovations and innovating firms in the UK from 19451983 shows that the scope and organisation of technological activities vary greatly as functions of firms' principal activities and size.

## 8. Multipass Seasonal Adjustment Filter
### Author(s):
- Tep Sastri
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1989
### Abstract:
A state-space seasonal time series model and a new seasonal decomposition algorithm, based on the Kalman filter, are introduced. The time series model is statistically equivalent to the multiplicative seasonal model, ARIMA (0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1)s, of Box and Jenkins. It is shown that the steady-state filter's forecasts of this model are identical to the Box and Jenkins' values.
