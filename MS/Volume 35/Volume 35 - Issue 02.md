## 1. Testing the Validity of a Queueing Model of Police Patrol
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
This paper describes efforts to validate a multiple car dispatch queueing (MCD) model of police patrol operations using New York City data. The MCD model was designed for use in a computer system that has been disseminated to many police departments in the U.S. to help planners allocate patrol cars among precincts. It has also been used to evaluate specific changes in patrol policy in New York. We define validation as a series of hierarchical procedures ranging from tests of mathematical correctness to evaluations of model robustness. We discuss the difficulties and limitations of assessing the validity of a model of a loosely managed system in which human behavior is central and in which controlled experiments cannot be performed. Focusing on specific uses, we conclude that the MCD model is a good although imperfect description of patrol operations in New York and is a potentially useful planning tool for many other urban police departments.

## 2. Planning for Surprise: Water Resources Development Under Demand and Supply Uncertainty I. The General Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
A study of water resources development in South Sweden revealed that water consumption unexpectedly stopped growing after construction had begun on a large project to expand water supplies. The project had a long lead time for completion, and planning had been based on traditional deterministic forecasts of future water use.

## 3. An Algorithm for Solving the Job-Shop Problem
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper, we propose a branch and bound method for solving the job-shop problem. It is based on one-machine scheduling problems and is made more efficient by several propositions which limit the search tree by using immediate selections.

## 4. The Single Machine Early/Tardy Problem
### Author(s):
- Peng Si Ow
- Thomas E. Morton
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
We examine the problem of scheduling a given set of jobs on a single machine to minimize total early and tardy costs. Two dispatch priority rules are proposed and tested for this NP-complete problem. These were found to perform far better than known heuristics that ignored early costs. For situations where the potential cost savings are sufficiently high to justify more sophisticated techniques, we propose a variation of the Beam Search method developed by researchers in artificial intelligence. This variant, called Filtered Beam Search, is able to use priority functions to search a number of solution paths in parallel. A computational study showed that this search method was not only efficient but also consistent in providing near-optimal solutions with a relatively small search tree. The study also includes an investigation of the impacts of Beam Search parameters on three variations of Beam Search for this problem.

## 5. Level Schedules for Mixed-Model Assembly Lines in Just-In-Time Production Systems
### Author(s):
- John Miltenburg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
Mixed-model assembly lines are used to produce many different products without carrying large inventories. The effective utilization of these lines requires that a schedule for assembling the different products be determined. For Just-In-Time (JIT) production systems, which require producing only the necessary products in the necessary quantities at the necessary times, the objective is to keep a constant rate of usage of all parts used by the line. This is called levelling or balancing the schedule. This paper develops a theoretical basis for scheduling these systems, and presents new scheduling algorithms and heuristics.

## 6. Industry Concentration and Allocation of Resources to Basic Research
### Author(s):

- Morris Hamburg
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
While the mainstream of Western economic thought believes in competitive markets, the Schumpeterian school considers concentrated industry to be the ideal vehicle for the advancement of industrial technology. Empirical evidence on the Schumpeterian hypothesis that a concentrated industry allocates relatively more resources to its research and development (R&D) activities has been inconclusive. We believe the reason is that the Schumpeterian hypothesis is too general and vague. The fact is that there are several dimensions of industrial concentration, for example, total number of firms in an industry, interfirm differences on a variety of characteristics such as sales, assets, resources, and so forth. Similarly, R&D activities are of several types such as long-term or short-term research, and basic research or applied research and development. Unfortunately, modeling efforts focusing on resource allocation by specific types of concentrated industries to specific types of R&D activities are almost nonexistent, with the exception of Joglekar and Hamburg (Joglekar, P., M. Hamburg. 1986. A homogeneous industry model of resource allocation to basic research and its policy implications. Management Sci. (February) 225236; Joglekar, P., M. Hamburg. 1987. Industry resource allocation to basic research under normally distributed benefits. Decision Sci. (Winter) 124.) who showed that industries consisting of smaller numbers of firms allocate relatively greater amounts of resources to their basic research than industries consisting of larger numbers of firms.

## 7. On Credible Delegation by Oligopolists: A Discussion of Distribution Channel Management
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
Several papers in the recent marketing literature have suggested that delegation in distribution (e.g., the use of independent middlemen) helps manufacturers to precommit strategically to profit-enhancing competitive actions. Further, the literature suggests that the profitability of such actions depends on market structure. We challenge these conclusions here. This is done in two steps. First, we perform an analysis of the entire class of models which have been used in the literature. Using internally consistent assumptions about market structure and contracting, the only subgame perfect equilibrium is one in which all distribution channels have infinitely many levels of delegation. Obviously, this is not what we see in the real world. Next, we relax a key hidden assumption, namely that all intra-channel agreements are observable to competitors. Without this assumption, the usual results unravel. Unless channel members can offer credible guarantees that unobservable agreements do not exist, the strategic effects of delegation disappear. Since these guarantees are virtually impossible to maintain credibly, we would expect to reject the hypothesis in the earlier literature relating channel structure to competition in an empirical study controlling for observability. We conclude that mechanisms other than strategic ones must be responsible for the existence of delegated channels, and make some suggestions about promising avenues for future theory research in channel structure.

## 8. Models for Managing Secrets
### Author(s):
- J. Michael Steele
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
Some elementary probability models are given that help articulate the trade-offs involved in managing secrets. One of these models captures the notion that the likelihood of disclosing a secret increases as the square of the number of people who are aware of it. Also, several classes of countermeasures are examined to determine their ability to increase the time window during which a secret can be held. One model suggests that disinformation countermeasures offer a promising technique for conserving secrets.

## 9. NoteOperations Sequencing in Discrete Parts Manufacturing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1989
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for efficiently sequencing the cutting operations associated with the manufacture of discrete parts on a CNC machine. The problem is first modeled as an integer program but recast via Lagrangian relaxation as a min-cut problem on a bipartite network. Tight lower bounds are obtained with a max-flow algorithm. The corresponding solution is used as input to a greedy heuristic which generates good feasible points. Given nonconvergence, a branch and bound strategy is used to find the optimal solution.
