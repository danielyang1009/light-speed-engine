## 1. An Overview of Representative Problems in Location Research

### Abstract:
We present a survey of over 50 representative problems in location research. Our goal is not to review all variants of different location models or to describe solution results, but rather to provide a broad overview of major location problems that have been studied, indicating briefly how they are formulated and how they relate to one another. We review standard problems such as median, center, and warehouse location problems, as well as less traditional location problems which have emerged in recent years. Our primary focus is on problems for which operations research-type models have been developed. Most of the problems we review have been formulated as optimization problems.

## 2. The Parameter Iteration Method in Dynamic Programming
### Author(s):
- Shmuel Gal
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
Many practical problems involve making optimal decisions for systems with state characterized by many components. These problems lead to dynamic programming problems with a very large number of state variables. Thus, an exact derivation of the optimal policy for such problems is not feasible to solve numerically due to the great amount of computer time and storage involved.

## 3. The Effect of Regret on Optimal Bidding in Auctions
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
While most models of auctions and competitive bidding assume that each bidder's utility for an outcome depends only on his own profit, we allow the utility to also depend on any regret that a bidder suffers after the fact and characterize when and how this affects bidding. Specifically, a winner might regret money left on the table in Federal offshore oil lease sales, while a loser might regret seeing an object sell for less than his own value for it. We show that for risk-neutral bidders who, after the fact, know the winner's price for the object, a bidder's optimal bidding strategy will not depend on the relative weight given to profit versus regret if both forms of regret weigh equally heavily. However, if bidders weight money-left-on-the-table regret more heavily, then the bid taker suffers. Likewise, if losers do not learn the winner's price, then the bid taker also suffers. Thus, the existing models' exclusion of regret from risk neutral bidders' utility functions affects the applicability of the resulting theory under certain, now clearly delineated, conditions.

## 4. A Cooperative Game Theory Model of Quantity Discounts
### Author(s):
- Rajeev Kohli
- Heungsoo Park
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
Quantity discounts offered by a monopolist are considered in the context of a bargaining problem in which the buyer and the seller negotiate over the order quantity and the average unit price. All-units and incremental quantity discounts that permit transaction at a negotiated outcome are described. The effects of risk sensitivity and bargaining power on quantity discounts are discussed for alternative bargaining models.

## 6. Recursion Models for Describing and Managing the Transient Flow of Materials in Generalized Flowlines
### Author(s):
- S. Saboo
- L. Wang
- W. E. Wilhelm
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
This paper describes new algorithms for estimating the transient performance of generalized flowlines in which completed products undergo test and rework until quality standards are met. The recursion approach is extended to incorporate features found in actual systems including (a) small-lot production, (b) priority release of kits, (c) lot sequencing (dispatching) at stations, (d) parallel machines at a station, (e) generalized flowline routing, and (f) test/rework cycles. Accuracy of the modeling approach is investigated and test scenarios demonstrate application of the model as an aid in evaluating certain management policies that affect material flow. A number of tests are based on an actual industrial setting involving the small-lot assembly of circuit cards (i.e., printed circuit boards).

## 7. Design of Product Specifications for Multi-Characteristic Inspection
### Author(s):
- Kwei Tang
- Jen Tang
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
A product often requires inspection on more than one characteristic. The traditional method determines inspection specifications for each characteristic independently. This practice ignores the interactions among characteristics in determining the disposition of an item, and prohibits tradeoffs among the quality of characteristics. In this paper, two multi-characteristic screening (complete inspection) models are proposed with different information processing requirements. In both models, screening specifications are jointly determined by considering all the economic and stochastic factors associated with the characteristics of interest. However, in Model 1, each characteristic has separate screening specifications and the inspection results of conformance (acceptance or rejections) of all the characteristics are used to determine the disposition of an item. In the second model, a joint screening rule based on an aggregation of characteristics is used to allow direct tradeoffs among the quality of characteristics. To implement the second model, the exact measured values of all characteristics of an item have to be recorded and used for a decision on that item. These two models are formulated and the solution procedures are developed. A numerical study is used to compare the cost performance and other plan characteristics of the independently-determined single characteristic models and the two multi-characteristic models.

## 8. Analysis of Profit-Linked Total-Factor Productivity Measurement Models at the Firm Level
### Author(s):
- David M. Miller

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1989
### Abstract:
The purpose of the paper is to present the results of a comparative analysis of two main-line productivity measurement procedures: the American Productivity Center's total factor model, and the Ethyl Corporation's Profitability = Productivity + Price Recovery model. Several fundamental differences between the two approaches are identified and analyzed. As demonstrated in the paper, differences such as the method of deflation can substantially affect the proper choice of the more appropriate procedure to use in a given corporate setting.
