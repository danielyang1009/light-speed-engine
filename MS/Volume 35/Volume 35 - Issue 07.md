### Published:

### Abstract:
Applications of inventory theory typically use historical data to estimate demand distribution parameters. Imprecise knowledge of the demand distribution adds to the usual replenishment costs associated with stochastic demands. Only limited research has been directed at the problem of choosing cost effective statistical procedures for estimating these parameters. Available theoretical findings on estimating the demand parameters for (s, S) inventory replenishment policies are limited by their restrictive assumptions. The impact on total system cost of using the sample mean and standard deviation as compared to robust parameter estimators has not been tested. This paper explores the circumstances under which the cost due to statistical estimation can be substantially reduced by a better choice of estimators. Specifically, an exponentially smoothed average and a modified exponentially smoothed mean absolute deviation are shown to outperform the sample mean and standard deviation for a wide range of computer simulated and U.S. Air Force empirical demands when the (s, S) policies are calculated using Ehrhardt's Power Approximation. Those situations in which the method of demand parameter estimation has negligible impact on total system cost are also indicated.

## 2. Modeling Integrative, Multiple Issue Bargaining
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Integrative, multiple issue bargaining can be expected to characterize many decision making situations in marketing. In this paper we present a mathematical model specifically appropriate to such negotiations. The central features of the model are: (i) the close relation of the structure of the model to integrative, multiple issue bargaining, (ii) the importance of the reference point as a determinant of the final outcome, and (iii) the property of the solution which implies that the balance of overall power is maintained at the final outcome. The equivalence of this model to an axiomatic model of cooperative bargaining is also shown. Regarding the model's predictive ability, results of the reported multiple issue bargaining experiment provide initial support.

## 3. Adverse Risk Incentives and the Design of Performance-Based Contracts
### Author(s):
- Mark Grinblatt
- Sheridan Titman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
This paper uses option pricing theory to value and analyze many performance-based fee contracts that are currently in use. A potential problem with some of these contracts is that they may induce portfolio managers to adversely alter the risk of the portfolios they manage. The paper is prescriptive in that it presents conditions for contract parameters that provide proper risk incentives for classes of investment strategies. For buy-and-hold and rebalancing strategies adverse risk incentives are avoided when the penalties for poor performance outweigh the rewards for good performance.

## 4. A Reduction Method Applicable to Compound Option Formulas
### Author(s):
- Mark Schroder
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
Curnow and Dunnett (Curnow, R. N., C. W. Dunnett. 1962. The numerical evaluation of certain multivariate normal integrals. Ann. Math. Statist.33 571579.) derive a reduction formula for multivariate normal integrals with a certain type of correlation matrix. This paper presents a more general reduction formula which can reduce substantially the computational cost of high dimension integrals. This method has a number of applications in option pricing theory in finance.

## 5. A Model for Assessing the Value of Warehouse Risk-Pooling: Risk-Pooling Over Outside-Supplier Leadtimes
### Author(s):
- Leroy B. Schwarz
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
This paper constructs and analyzes a multi-location inventory model to examine the value of warehouse risk-pooling in high service-level systems. Specifically, risk-pooling over the outside-supplier leadtime is examined. Two alternative systems of N identical retailers are formulated. In System 1, each retailer operates independently: retailers receive goods directly from an outside supplier after a fixed leadtime (Ls + Ltr), where Ls is the outside supplier's own (e.g., manufacturing) leadtime and Ltr is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the retailers. In System 2, the system order is shipped to a warehouse, arriving after a fixed leadtime (Ls + Ltw), where Ltw is the transportation/receiving leadtime to the warehouse. Upon receipt of the goods, the warehouse allocates and ships units to the retailers to equalize their inventory positions. The warehouse does not hold inventory. Allocation and reshipment in System 2 requires a fixed leadtime of (Lpw + Ltr) time periods, where Lpw is the allocation and (re)packaging leadtime at the warehouse. Hence, System 2 pools risk over the outside supplier leadtime, but at the cost of: (1) increased overall leadtime to the retailers; and (2) an internal pipeline inventory holding cost. Our analysis asks the question: given equal required service-levels and equal safety stock holding cost (plus pipeline inventory cost for System 2), how large can System 2's extra leadtimes (Ltw, Lpw) be? Our analysis concludes that pipeline inventory-holding cost significantly influences the overall value of these breakeven leadtimes. Specifically, when pipeline inventory holding costs can (somehow) be ignored, the corresponding breakeven leadtimes can be quite large. However, if these costs cannot be avoided, then the corresponding breakeven leadtimes are significantly reduced. Managerial interpretations are provided.

## 6. Computing Equilibrium Single Commodity Trade Flows Using Successive Overrelaxation
### Author(s):
- Faruk Gder
- James G. Morris
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
We consider a market economy that is composed of separate regions, each endowed with linear supply and demand curves and represented as a point on a transportation network. The problem addressed is to determine an equilibrium price in each region so that regional price differences do not exceed unit transportation costs, and when trade takes place between two regions, prices differ by the associated transportation cost.

## 7. Approximations for Product Departures from a Single-Server Station with Batch Processing in Multi-Product Queues
### Author(s):
- Gabriel R. Bitran
- D. Tirupati
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider a single-server station processing jobs belonging to multiple product classes. The processing at the station is in batches of fixed size, r. Job arrivals in different product classes are independent of the arrivals in other classes. The arrivals within each product class and the service times are assumed to have general, independent and identical distributions. Based on approximate analyses, we present an estimate for the mean number of jobs and provide two complementary characterizations of the product departure streams. We present methods to compute the squared coefficient of variation of the departure intervals and the probability distribution of the lot sizes of product departures.

## 8. Efficient Corporate Diversification: Methods and Implications
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
This study develops and tests a measure of efficient corporate diversification (ECD) that compares the variability of a firms revenues with the variability of a minimum-variance portfolio of businesses that maintain the same sales growth rate. According to ECD, which incorporates the exposure of a firm to business cycle fluctuations, a firm is considered more efficient the higher its ratio of minimum variance to the realized variance.

## 9. NoteAn Early Classic Misplaced: Ford W. Harris's Economic Order Quantity Model of 1915
### Author(s):
- Donald Erlenkotter
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1989
### Abstract:
The familiar square-root formula for the optimal economic order quantity was derived originally by Harris in 1915 (Harris, F. W. 1915. What quantity to make at once. The Library of Factory Management, Vol. V. Operation and Costs. A. W. Shaw Company, Chicago, 4752.). Since all citations found to Harris's paper over the past 35 years are incorrect, it seems that no one has been able to locate the paper during this period. The paper's apparent misplacement probably stems from an inaccurate citation given by Raymond in 1931 (Raymond, F. E. 1931. Quantity and Economy in Manufacture. McGraw-Hill, New York.). Harris's paper exemplifies skillful presentation of the concepts of management science, and still merits reading. Today's researcher can learn much from Harris's modeling approach, and would do well to emulate his expositional clarity and motivational effectiveness.
