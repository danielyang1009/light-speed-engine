## 1. Perceptual Position and Competitive Brand Strategy in a Two-Dimensional, Two-Brand Market
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Brand positioning and competitive reaction are important determinants of optimal brand strategy. Analyses of brand strategy have focused on optimal pricing and positioning issues using either empirical models of perceptions and preferences, game theory to examine competition, or both. However, the important issues of advertising and distribution strategy have not been fully addressed. This paper analyzes competition and strategy between two brands that compete in a two-dimensional market with advertising and distribution spending, in addition to prices and product positions. In particular, for a unimodal taste distribution of ideal points we show how

## 2. A Minimum Variance Result in Continuous Trading Portfolio Optimization
### Author(s):
- Henry R. Richardson
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
The problem of minimizing the variance of discounted wealth at the end of a fixed period is solved when the expectation of terminal wealth is constrained to a specified investment goal. The results are obtained in a continuous trading framework under the assumption that the funds can be exchanged between a riskless bond and a stock whose discounted price is described by a geometric Brownian motion. Transaction costs are ignored (i.e., the market is frictionless) and unlimited borrowing is permitted at the same rate as the return on the bond. Typically the optimal trading policy under the above assumptions involves a highly leveraged investment in the stock in the early stages followed by an accumulation of the bond in the later stages. Numerical results are provided as an illustration of the theory.

## 3. Evaluation of Aggregate and Individual Forecast Method Selection Rules
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
A major use of univariate forecasting methods lies in production control where there is a large number of series to be forecast. The appropriate choice of forecasting method has the potential for major cost savings through improved accuracy. Where a new method is to be compared to one already established two distinct approaches to selecting between the two can be considered: aggregate selection, where a single method is applied to all the time series, versus individual selection, where the particular method appropriate for each series is identified and used to forecast future observations for that series. This paper evaluates these two selection rules using 263 data series from a single organization. The results show the potential of individual selection and also the difficulty of attaining it. For short lead times aggregate selection achieves similar accuracy. For longer leads it is outperformed by individual selection and also undermined by sampling variability. As a consequence, aggregate selection must be carried out across a wide cross-section of series and across time. When this is done the results of this case study show that aggregate selection is both simpler than and of comparable accuracy to individual selection.

## 4. The Impact of Clustered Defect Distributions in IC Fabrication
### Author(s):

- David J. Friedman
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
Whenever defect data is encountered in industrial quality control applications, the Poisson distribution is generally assumed to be the underlying distribution. It has been widely reported that the defect distributions in integrated circuit fabrication exhibit clustering behavior, a condition which invalidates the Poisson distribution assumption. In this paper we employ an alternative model for defect data that exhibits clustering. To demonstrate the impact of the proposed model, we use it to design acceptance sampling plans and show a dramatic difference between these plans and those determined under the Poisson distribution assumption. Although advances in quality control and techniques such as design for manufacture have eliminated the need for acceptance sampling in many areas, integrated circuit fabrication still involves processes with high variability (even using state of the art equipment). Thus acceptance sampling is widely used at various stages of manufacture to insure specified quality levels when 100 percent inspection is infeasible.

## 5. Kanban Controlled Pull Systems: An Analytic Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
Three problem areas exist in designing and implementing a kanban controlled JIT system: the identification of flow lines problem, the flow line loading problem and the operational control problem. This paper addresses the operational control problem. A general N-stage serial production system is modeled as a discrete time Markov process. Capacity constraints, stochastic machine reliability and demand variability are included. The model is illustrated by a 3-stage system, describing the effects of the number of kanbans, the machine reliability, the demand variability and safety stock requirements on the performance of a kanban controlled pull system.

## 6. Preference Structure Representation Using Convex Cones in Multicriteria Integer Programming
### Author(s):

- Mark H. Karwan
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
A new efficient system of representing the decision-maker's preference structure in solving multicriteria integer programming problems is developed. The problem is solved by an interactive branch-and-bound method that employs the procedure of Zionts and Wallenius (Zionts, S., J. Wallenius. 1983. An interactive multiple objective linear programming method for a class of underlying nonlinear utility functions. Management Sci.29(5).) for multicriteria linear programming. The decision-maker's underlying utility function is assumed to be pseudoconcave, and his pairwise comparisons of decision alternatives are used to determine his preference structure in terms of certain convex cones in the objective function space and constraints on the weights on the objectives in the weight space. The two forms of preference structure representation are interrelated, and their underlying theory is developed. The primary objective of a representation scheme is exactness, and, in this respect, it is shown that the constraints on the weights are not adequate for representing nonlinear utility functions. On the other hand, the convex cones exactly represent any quasiconcave utility function and clearly avoid the approximations and inaccuracies in other utility assessment systems. Accordingly, an efficient ordered representation using convex cones is developed. An algorithmic framework for multicriteria integer programming that integrates the representation using convex cones with the branch-and-bound solution procedure is developed. Computational experience with bicriteria problems having up to 80 variables and 40 constraints is presented.

## 7. The Tolerance Approach to Sensitivity Analysis of Matrix Coefficients in Linear Programming
### Author(s):
- N. Ravi
- Richard E. Wendell
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
The tolerance approach to sensitivity analysis allows for simultaneous and independent variations of the elements of a column or a row of the coefficient matrix in a standard linear programming problem. In particular, the approach yields a maximum tolerance percentage within which the elements of a column may all vary simultaneously and independently from their estimated values while still retaining the same set of basic variables in an optimal solution. A similar result is also derived for the perturbations of the elements of a row.

## 8. Dependability and Organizational Bankruptcy: An Application of Agency and Prospect Theory
### Author(s):
- Richard A. D'Aveni
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
This paper proposes and tests a new model of organizational bankruptcy based on agency and prospect theory. The paper argues that debtors with unprestigious top managers, low liquidity and high leverage signal that they will be undependable exchange partners. The model proposes that survival is contingent on maintaining an acceptable, minimum level of these financial and managerial assets. If a firm falls below that threshold level, it has a higher probability of bankruptcy because creditors withdraw their financial support from the debtor. Consistent with agency theory, this implies that bankruptcy can be viewed as the legal resolution of severe shareholder-creditor conflicts about the levels of financial and managerial assets that the debtor should maintain.

- Amy Hing-Ling Lau
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1989
### Abstract:
In recent years skewness has become a much-discussed factor in financial research, and many studies/models involve the skewness of various financial variables. This paper (i) points out the universal neglect in the finance literature of skewness' sampling error and its significant consequences; (ii) presents a simple approach for roughly constructing a confidence interval for skewness estimated from lognormal populations; (iii) points out directions of further research for developing a comprehensive approach for estimating skewness reliably.
