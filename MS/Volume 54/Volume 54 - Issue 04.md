### Abstract:
Traditional inventory models, with a few exceptions, do not account for the existence of inventory record inaccuracy (IRI), and those that do treat IRI as random. This study explores IRI observed both within and across product categories and retail stores. Examining nearly 370,000 inventory records from 37 stores of one retailer, we find 65% to be inaccurate. We characterize the distribution of IRI and show, using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), that 26.4% of the total variance in IRI lies between product categories and that 2.7% lies between stores. We identify several factors that mitigate record inaccuracy, such as inventory auditing practices, and several factors that exacerbate record inaccuracy, such as the complexity of the store environment and the distribution structure. Collectively, these covariates explain 67.6% and 69.0% of the variance in IRI across stores and product categories, respectively. Our findings underscore the need to design processes to reduce the occurrence of IRI and highlight factors that can be incorporated into inventory planning tools developed to account for its presence.

### Abstract:
Software vulnerabilities represent a serious threat to cybersecurity, most cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, there is no agreed-upon policy for their disclosure. Disclosure policy (which sets a protected period given to a vendor to release the patch for the vulnerability) indirectly affects the speed and quality of the patch that a vendor develops. Thus, CERT/CC and similar bodies acting in the public interest can use disclosure to influence the behavior of vendors and reduce social cost. This paper develops a framework to analyze the optimal timing of disclosure. We formulate a model involving a social planner who sets the disclosure policy and a vendor who decides on the patch release. We show that the vendor typically releases the patch less expeditiously than is socially optimal. The social planner optimally shrinks the protected period to push the vendor to deliver the patch more quickly, and sometimes the patch release time coincides with disclosure. We extend the model to allow the proportion of users implementing patches to depend upon the quality (chosen by the vendor) of the patch. We show that a longer protected period does not always result in a better patch quality. Another extension allows for some fraction of users to use work-arounds. We show that the possibility of work-arounds can provide the social planner with more leverage, and hence the social planner shrinks the protected period. Interestingly, the possibility of work-arounds can sometimes increase the social cost due to the negative externalities imposed by the users who are able to use the work-arounds on the users who are not.

## 4. Security Patch Management: Share the Burden or Share the Damage?

### Abstract:
Patch management is a crucial component of information security management. An important problem within this context from a vendor's perspective is to determine how to release patches to fix vulnerabilities in its software. From a firm's perspective, the issue is how to update vulnerable systems with available patches. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to study the strategic interaction between a vendor and a firm in balancing the costs and benefits of patch management. Our objective is to examine the consequences of time-driven release and update policies. We first study a centralized system in a benchmark scenario to find the socially optimal time-driven patch management. We show that the social loss is minimized when patch-release and update cycles are synchronized. Next, we consider a decentralized system in which the vendor determines its patch-release policy and the firm selects its patch-update policy in a Stackelberg framework, assuming that release and update policies are either time driven or event driven. We develop a sufficient condition that guarantees that a time-driven release by the vendor and a time-driven update by the firm is the equilibrium outcome for patch management. However, in this equilibrium, the patch-update cycle of the firm may not be synchronized with the patch-release cycle of the vendor, making it impossible to achieve the socially optimal patch management in the decentralized system. Therefore, we next examine cost sharing and liability as possible coordination mechanisms. Our analysis shows that cost sharing itself may achieve synchronization and social optimality. However, liability by itself cannot achieve social optimality unless patch-release and update cycles are already synchronized without introducing any liability. Our results also demonstrate that cost sharing and liability neither complement nor substitute each other. Finally, we show that an incentive-compatible contract on cost sharing can be designed to achieve coordination in case of information asymmetry.

### Abstract:
Sales technology has been touted as a primary tool for enhancing customer relationship management. However, empirical research is sparse concerning the use of information technology (IT) and its effects on the relationship between salespersons and customers. Using an interdisciplinary research approach, we extend task-technology-fit (TTF) theory by examining the mechanisms through which use of IT by the sales force influences salesperson performance. We test a model that incorporates salespersons' customer service, attention to personal details, adaptability, and knowledgekey marketing constructs that could mediate IT's impact on salesperson performance. Results in a pharmaceutical sales setting indicate that IT use can improve customer service and salespersons' adaptability, leading to improved sales performance.

## 6. Designing Pricing Contracts for Boundedly Rational Customers: Does the Framing of the Fixed Fee Matter?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 12 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
The format of pricing contracts varies substantially across business contexts, a major variable being whether a contract imposes a fixed fee payment. This paper examines how the use of the fixed fee in pricing contracts affects market outcomes of a manufacturer-retailer channel. Standard economic theories predict that channel efficiency increases with the introduction of the fixed fee and is invariant to its framing. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test these predictions. Surprisingly, the introduction of the fixed fee fails to increase channel efficiency. Moreover, the framing of the fixed fee does make a difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent.

## 7. Contracting and Information Sharing Under Supply Chain Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 18 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
We investigate contracting and information sharing in two competing supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. The two supply chains are identical, except they may have different investment costs for information sharing. The problem is studied using a two-stage game. In the first stage, the manufacturers decide whether to invest in information sharing. In the second stage, given the information structure created in the first stage, the manufacturers offer contracts to their retailers and the retailers engage in Cournot competition. We analyze the game for two different contract types. For the case of contract menus, a supply chain that does not have information sharing will lower its selling quantities because of the negative quantity distortions in the contract menus, thus creating a strategic disadvantage in Cournot competition. The value of information sharing to a supply chain is positive, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is to invest in information sharing when the investment costs are low. We fully characterize the equilibrium information sharing decisions under different investment costs. For the case of linear price contracts, the value of information sharing to a supply chain becomes negative, and the dominant strategy of each supply chain is not to invest in information sharing regardless of investment costs. Our results highlight the importance of contract type as a driver of the value of information sharing and the role of information sharing capability as a source of competitive advantage under supply chain competition.

## 8. Inventory Management with Advance Demand Information and Flexible Delivery
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
This paper considers inventory models with advance demand information and flexible delivery. Customers place their orders in advance, and delivery is flexible in the sense that early shipment is allowed. Specifically, an order placed at time t by a customer with demand lead time T should be fulfilled by period t + T; failure to fulfill it within the time window [t, t + T] is penalized. We consider two situations: (1) Customer demand lead times are homogeneous and demand arriving in period t is a scalar dt to be satisfied within T periods. We show that state-dependent (s, S) policies are optimal, where the state represents advance demands outside the supply lead-time horizon. We find that increasing the demand lead time is more beneficial than decreasing the supply lead time. (2) Customers are heterogeneous in their demand lead times. In this case, demands are vectors and may exhibit crossover, necessitating an allocation decision in addition to the ordering decision. We develop a lower-bound approximation based on an allocation assumption, and propose protection-level heuristics that yield upper bounds on the optimal cost. Numerical analysis quantifies the optimality gaps of the heuristics (2% on average for the best heuristic) and the benefit of delivery flexibility (14% on average using the best heuristic), and provides insights into when the heuristics perform the best and when flexibility is most beneficial.

## 9. Competition and Cooperation in Decentralized Push and Pull Assembly Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we study a decentralized assembly system consisting of a single assembler who buys complementary components from independent suppliers under two contracting schemes: push and pull. In both schemes, the component suppliers are allowed to freely form coalitions (or alliances) among themselves to better coordinate their pricing or production decisions. We show that the sole driver of the inefficiency in a push system, which is due to horizontal decentralization of suppliers, is the number of alliances that were formed. Specifically, it is shown that in a push system, the assembler's profit, the total profit of all suppliers and the consumers' surplus are all decreasing in the number of coalitions, and are thus maximized when the grand coalition is formed. We further carry out a stability analysis of coalition structures to verify to what extent suppliers can reduce or eliminate the inefficiency due to their decentralization by forming alliances. We show that in a push system with more than two suppliers and a power demand distribution, myopic suppliers would act independently, resulting with a least efficient channel, which makes all channel members, as well as the end consumers, worse off. On the other hand, we prove that farsighted suppliers would form the grand coalition and thus be able to completely eliminate the inefficiency stemming from their decentralization. Finally, it is shown that, in contrast to a push system, in a pull system the suppliers can easily coordinate their production quantities to eliminate the inefficiency due to their decentralization.

## 10. Analysis of Direct Shipping Policies in an Inventory-Routing Problem with Discrete Shipping Times
### Author(s):
- Luca Bertazzi
### Published:
- 14 Jan 2008
### Abstract:
We consider the problem in which several products have to be shipped from a supplier to a set of retailers over an infinite time horizon. Each product is made available at the supplier and absorbed by each retailer at given constant production and consumption rates. For each product, the unit inventory cost at the supplier is equal to the unit inventory cost at the retailers. Shipments can be performed in each discrete time instant by a fleet of vehicles of given transportation capacity, and routing is allowed. The aim is to determine shipping policies that minimize the sum of transportation cost and inventory cost both at the supplier and at the retailers. We study direct shipping policies, i.e., policies in which each retailer is served independently. We show the worst-case performance of the best single, best double, best triple, best frequency-based, and optimal direct shipping policies. In each of these policies each link is optimized independently. We prove that, in the worst case, the ratio between the cost of the optimal direct shipping policy and the optimal cost of the problem in which routing is allowedi.e., the worst-case performance bound of this policyis not greater than two whenever the unit volume on each link is not lower than 1/4 of the vehicle capacity. Moreover, if the unit volume is not lower than the capacity, the bound is about 1.21. These bounds are tight and obtained by applying frequency-based policies that make use of at most three different shipping frequencies and cannot be improved by allowing more frequencies or using time-based policies on each link. Computational results show that the best among the frequency-based direct shipping policies used to obtain the worst-case results gives an average percent increase error, with respect to a lower bound on the optimal cost of the problem in which routing is allowed, of 6.44% on a large set of randomly generated problem instances.

### Published:
- 12 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
Deterministic inventory theory provides streamlined optimization models that attempt to capture trade-offs in managing the flow of goods through a supply chain. We will consider two well-studied deterministic inventory models, called the one-warehouse multiretailer (OWMR) problem and its special case the joint replenishment problem (JRP), and give approximation algorithms with worst-case performance guarantees. That is, for each instance of the problem, our algorithm produces a solution with cost that is guaranteed to be at most 1.8 times the optimal cost; this is called a 1.8-approximation algorithm. Our results are based on an LP-rounding approach; we provide the first constant approximation algorithm for the OWMR problem and improve the previous results for the JRP.

## 12. Quantity Discounts Under Demand Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
To motivate buyers to increase their order quantity, suppliers often rely on a well-established and widely used approachthey offer quantity discounts. This practice is in large part driven to obtain improved economies in transportation through higher truckload utilization. Recently, transportation rates, which are increasing faster than other costs, have become a larger portion of total net landed cost, placing the traditional quantity-discount practices under scrutiny. Many suppliers are left perplexed as to why their approach is not effective anymore, and some are even concerned that their overall profits may have actually decreased due to their discount parameters. In this paper, we study a multiperiod model, with a buyer facing stochastic end-item demand and a supplier offering an all-units quantity discount to him, to understand better the dynamics of such systems. We provide guidelines and insights on how to set effective discount parameters, and when not to expect much from them. We derive the optimal policy of the buyer, develop insights as to why the policy is complex, study the supplier's profit as a function of her offered quantity-discount scheme (accommodating the buyer's optimal policy), and discover a new phenomenon that is distinct and structurally different from the well-known bullwhip effect.

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we examine contracts to coordinate the capacity decision of a vendor who has been hired by a client to provide call center support. We consider a variety of contracts, all based on our observations of contracts used by one large vendor. We examine the role of different contract features such as pay-per-time, pay-per-call, service-level agreements, and constraints on service rates and abandonment. We show how different combinations of these contract features enable client firms to better manage vendors when there is information asymmetry about worker productivity. In particular, we focus on how different contracts can coordinate by yielding the system-optimal capacity decision by the vendor and consider how profits are allocated between the client and the vendor.

## 14. Regret and Feedback Information in First-Price Sealed-Bid Auctions
### Author(s):
- Richard Engelbrecht-Wiggans
- Elena Katok
### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
We investigate the effect of regret-related feedback information on bidding behavior in sealed-bid first-price auctions. Two types of regret are possible in this auction format. A winner of the auction may regret paying too much relative to the second highest bid, and a loser may regret missing an opportunity to win at a favorable price. In theory, under very general conditions, being sensitive to winning and paying too much should result in lower average bids, and being sensitive to missing opportunities to win at a favorable price should result in higher bids. For example, the U.S. Government's policy of revealing losing bids may cause regret-sensitive bidders to anticipate regret and bid conservatively, decreasing the government's revenue. We test these predictions in the laboratory and find strong support for both.

## 15. A Dynamic Competitive Forecasting Model Incorporating Dyadic Decision Making
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
New products are often launched sequentially, by different firms, and the purchasing decisions are sometimes made by dyads. This paper proposes a new model that explicitly considers dyadic decision making in drug prescription and allows assessment of the relative influence that physicians and patients have in making decisions concerning new as well as existing ethical drugs. Modeling sequentially launched competing products in a category allows for parsing out effects that are hard to differentiate in models designed to capture only a single product's dynamics. The proposed model is applied to prescription drug data sets in the pharmaceutical industry, and it also explicitly captures both physicians' and patients' pretrial and posttrial utilities of each drug in the therapeutic category. Based on the model's fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance, we find that, in many cases, the incorporation of the dyadic decision making leads to better performance vis--vis models where such decision making is not explicitly considered. We also find that in many cases the posttrial utility of a drug is greater than its corresponding pretrial utility, lending partial empirical support to the prevailing industry practice of spending on various activities (e.g., sampling to physicians) needed to get potential patients to try a new drug. The proposed model enables managers to predict in advance the sales of sequentially launched new drugs and plan the new product launch and strategy accordingly. The model is also applicable to other product categories involving more than a single decision maker, including business-to-business products (e.g., office equipment) as well as to products targeting children (e.g., toys).

## 16. Interior Additivity and Subjective Probability Assessment of Continuous Variables
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
One of the goals of psychological research on subjective probability judgment is to develop prescriptive procedures that can improve such judgments. In this paper, our aim is to reduce partition dependence, a judgmental bias that arises from the particular way in which a state space is partitioned for the purposes of making probability judgments. We explore a property of subjective probabilities called interior additivity (IA). Our story begins with a psychological model of subjective probability judgment that exhibits IA. The model is a linear combination of underlying support for the event in question and a term that reflects a prior belief that all elements in the state space partition are equally likely. The model is consistent with known properties of subjective probabilities, such as binary complementarity, subadditivity, and partition dependence, and has several additional properties related to IA. We present experimental evidence to support our model. The model further suggests a simple prescriptive method based on IA that decision and risk analysts can use to reduce partition dependence, and we present preliminary empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.

## 17. Research NoteTesting File Sharing's Impact on Music Album Sales in Cities
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Apr 2008
### Abstract:
Using a data set including album sales, Internet penetration, and various demographic measures for 99 American cities over the period 19982003, this paper empirically examines the extent to which file sharing has caused the U.S. decline in sound-recording sales over that period. Also examined is the impact of the Internet on entertainment activities so as to help cleanse the Internet penetration coefficient of that impact. The conclusion from this analysis is that file sharing appears to have caused the entire decline in record sales and appears to have vitiated what otherwise would have been growth in the industry.
