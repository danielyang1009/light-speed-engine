## 2. The Hidden Perils of Career Concerns in R&D Organizations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
This research examines how certain economic incentives can lead agents to prefer difficult solutions to their organizational tasks that reduce their likelihood of obtaining a successful task outcome. Drawing on the career concerns literature, I model a decision context in which agents have the operational autonomy to choose among different solutions. Analyzing this model reveals that agents with career concerns will, under certain conditions, deliberately reduce their likelihood of succeeding with a task by choosing a solution that makes their task more difficult. These findings suggest that highly capable agents prefer moderately difficult tasks to showcase their capability, while less-capable agents prefer highly difficult tasks to mask their lack of capability. The robustness of these results is examined in various extensions. Furthermore, the paper provides insights on how incentives can be designed to alleviate this problem.

### Abstract:
This paper provides empirical evidence on the effect of product introduction delays on accounting-based measures of operating performance. Based on a diverse set of 450 publicly traded firms that experienced product introduction delays, we find that delays have a statistically significant negative effect on profitability. Depending on the method used to estimate abnormal performance, the median abnormal decline in return on assets (ROA) ranges from 2.70% to 3.44% over a three-year period around the year of the delay announcement. The median decline in sales over assets ranges from 5.92% to 10.99%, and the median decline in return on sales ranges from 1.48% to 3.06%. Cross-sectional regression analysis indicates that the impact of delays on abnormal ROA is more negative for smaller firms, and for firms that are more profitable before the delay. Furthermore, the impact is more negative for firms that operate in industries that are larger and more profitable. We also find a positive association between abnormal ROA and abnormal stock price performance around the product introduction delay announcements.

### Abstract:
The effects of appropriability on invention have been well studied, but there has been little analysis of the effect of appropriability on the commercialization of existing inventions. Exploiting a database of 805 attempts by private firms to commercialize inventions licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) between 1980 and 1996, we explore the influence of several appropriability mechanisms on the commercialization and termination of projects to develop products based on university inventions. Our central hypothesis is that the relationship between a licensee's decision to either terminate or commercialize the invention is driven by the current market value of the invention, as well as the option value of delaying its commercialization. We use a competing risks framework that allows for nonparametric heterogeneity and correlated risks. We find that better appropriability in the sense of more effective patent strength and secrecy has a strong negative effect on the hazard of license termination. The effectiveness of learning has a strong positive effect on the hazard of technology commercialization, while lead time has a negative effect.

## 5. A Theoretical Framework for Managing the New Product Development Portfolio: When and How to Use Strategic Buckets
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
Developing the right new products is critical to firm success and is often cited as a key competitive dimension. This paper explores new product development (NPD) portfolio strategy and the balance between incremental and radical innovation. We characterize innovative effort through a normative theoretical framework that addresses a popular practice in NPD portfolio management: the use of strategic buckets. Strategic buckets encourage the division of the overall NPD resource budget into smaller, more focused budgets that are defined by the type of innovative effort (incremental or radical). We show that time commitment determines the balance between incremental and radical innovation. When managers execute this balance, they are often confounded by (i) environmental complexity, defined as the number of unknown interdependencies among technology and market parameters that determine product performance; and (ii) environmental instability, the probability of changes to the underlying performance functions. Although both of these factors confound managers, we find that they have completely opposite effects on the NPD portfolio balance. Environmental complexity shifts the balance toward radical innovation. Conversely, environmental instability shifts the balance toward incremental innovation. Risk considerations and implications for theory and practice are also discussed.

## 6. Does Component Sharing Help or Hurt Reliability? An Empirical Study in the Automotive Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
Component sharingthe use of a component on multiple products within a firm's product lineis widely practiced as a means of offering high variety at low cost. Although many researchers have examined trade-offs involved in component sharing, little research has focused on the impact of component sharing on quality. In this paper, we examine how component sharing impacts one dimension of qualityreliabilitydefined as mean time to failure. Design considerations suggest that a component designed uniquely for a product will result in higher reliability due to the better fit of the component within the architecture of the product. On the other hand, the learning curve literature suggests that greater experience with a component can improve conformance quality, and can increase reliability via learning from end-user feedback. The engineering literature suggests that improved conformance in turn increases reliability. Sharing a component across multiple products increases experience, and hence, should increase reliability. Using data from the automotive industry, we find support for the hypothesis that higher component reliability is associated with higher cumulative experience with a component. Further, we find support for the hypothesis that higher component reliability is associated with a component that has been designed uniquely for a product. This finding suggests that the popular design strategy of component sharing can in some cases compromise product quality, via reduced reliability.

## 7. The Dual Role of Modularity: Innovation and Imitation

### Published:
- 20 Feb 2008
### Abstract:
Modularity has been heralded as an organizational and technical architecture that enhances incremental and modular innovation. Less attention has been paid to the possible implications of modular architectures for imitation. To understand the implications of modular designs for competitive advantage, one must consider the dual impact of modularity on innovation and imitation jointly. In an attempt to do so, we set up three alternative structures that vary in the extent of modularity and hence in the extent of design complexity: nonmodular, modular, and nearly modular designs. In each structure, we examine the trade-offs between innovation benefits and imitation deterrence. The results of our computational experiments indicate that modularization enables performance gains through innovation but, at the same time, sets the stage for those gains to be eroded through imitation. In contrast, performance differences between the leaders and imitators persist in the nearly modular and the nonmodular structures. Overall, we find that design complexity poses a significant trade-off between innovation benefits (i.e., generating superior strategies that create performance differences) and imitation deterrence (i.e., preserving the performance differences). We also examine the robustness of our results to variations in imitation accuracy. In addition to documenting the overall robustness of our principal finding, the ancillary analyses provide a more nuanced rendering of the relationship between the architecture of complexity and imitation efforts.

## 8. Sequential Testing of Product Designs: Implications for Learning
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
Past research in new product development (NPD) has conceptualized prototyping as a design-build-test-analyze cycle to emphasize the importance of the analysis of test results in guiding the decisions made during the experimentation process. New product designs often involve complex architectures and incorporate numerous components, and this makes the ex ante assessment of their performance difficult. Still, design teams often learn from test outcomes during iterative test cycles enabling them to infer valuable information about the performances of (as yet) untested designs. We conceptualize the extent of useful learning from analysis of a test outcome as depending on two key structural characteristics of the design space, namely whether the set of designs are close to each other (i.e., the designs are similar on an attribute level) and whether the design attributes exhibit nontrivial interactions (i.e., the performance function is complex).

## 9. Fragmented Property Rights and Incentives for R&D
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
Where product innovation requires several complementary patents, fragmented property rights can limit firms' willingness to invest in R&D. We consider the research intensity in multiple simultaneous R&D contests and how it depends on whether firms already hold relevant patents as well as the availability of an option to invent around. A measure of technological uncertainty is also analyzed. The multiple patent product involves an important hold-up problem that can reduce the overall R&D effort. Invent-around options moderate this problem. We also analyze targeted equilibria in which the aim of R&D can be to hold up a rival.

## 10. The Impact of Uncertain Intellectual Property Rights on the Market for Ideas: Evidence from Patent Grant Delays
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
This paper considers the impact of the intellectual property (IP) system on the timing of cooperation/licensing by start-up technology entrepreneurs. If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether IP has already been granted. In contrast, the need to disclose complementary (yet unprotected) knowledge, asymmetric information or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. We employ a data set combining information about cooperative licensing and the timing of patent allowances (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified). Although preallowance licensing does occur, the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement significantly increases after patent allowance. Moreover, the impact of the patent system depends on the strategic and institutional environment in which firms operate. Patent allowance plays a particularly important role for technologies with longer technology life cycles or that lack alternative appropriation mechanisms such as copyright, reputation, or brokers. The findings suggest that imperfections in the market for ideas may be important, and that formal IP rights may facilitate gains from technological trade.

## 11. Heterogeneity and Network Structure in the Dynamics of Diffusion: Comparing Agent-Based and Differential Equation Models
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
When is it better to use agent-based (AB) models, and when should differential equation (DE) models be used? Whereas DE models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, AB models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. AB models relax aggregation assumptions, but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the dynamics of a stochastic AB model with those of the analogous deterministic compartment DE model. We examine the impact of individual heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of outcomes. More interestingly, the DE and mean AB dynamics differ for several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed, peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden. The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these differences in means are small compared to variability caused by stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous processes of diffusion and social contagion.

## 12. Pricing an Option on Revenue from an Innovation: An Application to Movie Box Office Revenue
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 May 2008
### Abstract:
We develop a model for valuing revenue streams from innovations. The stochastic properties of revenue from innovations create a more difficult environment in which to value options than when the underlying is a security. There is no initial revenue, and cumulative revenue cannot decrease. Revenues from innovations are characterized by different lives and different rates of the resolution of uncertainty. A common deterministic model for predicting revenue from an innovation is known as the Bass model. We embed the Bass model in a gamma process, resulting in a stochastic process with moments proportional to the mean of the Bass model. To illustrate this model we choose the valuation of options on movie box office revenue. These options enable film distributors to manage the risk of a movie, and they offer diversification opportunities for investors. We develop the econometric methodology for ex ante parameter estimation and a Bayesian updating scheme using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation as data after release become available. Call prices obtained using the maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimates from the full data set closely approximate the average discounted value of ex post call payouts that would have occurred at option maturity.

## 13. Research NoteWhen Is Versioning Optimal for Information Goods?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 2008
### Abstract:
This paper provides insights about when versioning is an optimal strategy for information goods. Our characterization of this class of goods is that variable costs are invariant with quality, including the special case of zero variable costs. Our analysis assumes a monopoly firm that has an existing product in the market and has an opportunity to segment the market by introducing additional lower-quality versions. We derive a simple decision rule for determining the optimality of versioning based on the solution to a single-product maximization problem. Versioning is optimal when the optimal market share of the lower-quality version, offered alone, is greater than the optimal market share of the high-quality version, offered alone. A firm can profitably employ versioning for an information good if it can design the lower quality in a way that, relative to their valuations for the high-end version, high-type consumers have a lower relative valuation for the lower quality than do low-type consumers. When variable costs increase, a firm that offered only one product version need not consider adding another version. When variable costs decrease, the firm should explore adding a lower-quality version.
