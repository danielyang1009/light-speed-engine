### Abstract:
For over half a century, Management Science has promoted scientific research into the practice of management. Because management is a vast and complex activity, early researchers tended to adopt a reductionist approach by concentrating on narrow subproblems. As a result, the journal was initially dominated by studies of tactical issues and quantitative solution techniques. But recent publication trends suggest that scholars are turning their attention to broader, more realistic management issues, and are using a wider range of research methods to address them. This is fueling a research renaissance that offers hope for significant progress toward creation of a legitimate science of management.

## 3. How Does Outsourcing Affect Performance Dynamics? Evidence from the Automobile Industry
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper examines the impact of vertical integration on the dynamics of performance over the automobile product development life cycle. Building on recent work in organizational economics and strategy, we evaluate the relationship between vertical integration and different dimensions of product performance. Outsourcing facilitates access to cutting-edge technology and the use of high-powered performance contracts. Vertical integration allows firms to adapt to unforeseen contingencies and customer feedback, maintain balanced incentives over the life cycle, and develop firm-specific capabilities over time. Together, these effects highlight a crucial trade-off: while outsourcing is associated with higher levels of initial performance, vertical integration will be associated with performance improvement over the product life cycle. We test these ideas using detailed data from the luxury automobile segment, establishing three key results. First, initial performance is declining in the level of vertical integration. Second, the level of performance improvement is significantly increasing in the level of vertical integration. Finally, the impact of vertical integration is mediated by the level of preexisting capabilities, by the salience of opportunities to access external technology leaders, and by the scope for learning over the product life cycle. Together, the findings highlight a strategic governance trade-off between short-term performance and the evolution of firm capabilities.

## 4. Strategic Interaction Across Countries and Multinational Agglomeration: An Application to the Cement Industry
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
Agglomeration in foreign direct investment (FDI) is typically attributed to location-specific characteristics such as natural resource advantages or production-related spillovers between multinational firms. The increasing collocation of the largest global firms in the cement industry since the 1980s is not easily attributed to either of these explanations. This paper draws on theories of multimarket contact to test whether strategic interaction across national markets has influenced the successive market entry decisions generating the observed agglomeration. We first establish that there is indeed nonrandom agglomeration of the six largest cement firms. We next show that preexisting cross-market interaction with current incumbents helps predict which firm will enter a given market and also the choice of market a given firm enters. The association does not appear to be caused by strategic convergence or mimicry of recent entry events and cannot be explained by production side effects, which depend only on local conditions. The findings are consistent with multimarket contact models where collocation allows firms to sustain higher prices in all markets. This latter inference is also supported by evidence of an association between global firm market share and local cement price. The paper suggests that pricing spillovers can serve as an alternative motivation for FDI agglomeration.

## 5. Component Procurement Strategies in Decentralized Assemble-to-Order Systems with Time-Dependent Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
We consider a contract manufacturer who procures multiple components from independent suppliers to produce an assemble-to-order customized product for a client. The unit price of the product depends on the manufacturer's delivery lead time. We explore how the manufacturer can use a vendor-managed consignment inventory (VMCI) scheme to manage the underlying risk and coordinate independent suppliers' decisions on the production quantities of their components under demand uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game played by the manufacturer against her component suppliers to determine her pricing policy for suppliers' consignment inventories. We further develop an efficient algorithm for finding the manufacturer's optimal pricing scheme. Our results provide useful insights for managing components in these types of assemble-to-order environments and for understanding how component production cost and procurement lead times affect individual firms' performance in decentralized assembly channels.

## 6. Optimal Patenting and Licensing of Financial Innovations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Aug 2008
### Abstract:
Recent court decisions, starting with the State Street decision in 1998, allow business methods to be patentable and now give financial institutions the option to seek patent protection for financial innovations. This new patentability paradigm and the heterogeneity of characteristics associated with financial innovations pose an immediate decision problem for senior management: what to patent. We present a parsimonious decision framework that answers this question. We show that for innovations with certain characteristics, it is optimal not to patent, even if the option of patenting and licensing is available. Our model emphasizes the role of embedded real options that arise from certain types of financial innovations. The model provides an explanation of observed patenting behavior of financial institutions and the success of a wide class of innovations, including swaps, credit derivatives, and pricing algorithms.

## 7. Identifying Formal and Informal Influence in Technology Adoption with Network Externalities
### Author(s):
- Catherine Tucker
### Published:
- 20 Aug 2008
### Abstract:
Firms introducing network technologies (whose benefits depend on who installs the technology) need to understand which user characteristics confer the greatest network benefits on other potential adopters. To examine which adopter characteristics matter, I use the introduction of a video-messaging technology in an investment bank. I use data on its 2,118 employees, their adoption decisions, and their 2.4 million subsequent calls. The video-messaging technology can also be used to watch TV. Exogenous shocks to the benefits of watching TV are used to identify the causal (network) externality of one individual user's adoption on others' adoption decisions. I allow this network externality to vary in size with a variety of measures of informal and formal influence. I find that adoption by either managers or workers in boundary spanner positions has a large impact on the adoption decisions of employees who wish to communicate with them. Adoption by ordinary workers has a negligible impact. This suggests that firms should target those who derive their informal influence from occupying key boundary-spanning positions in communication networks, in addition to those with sources of formal influence, when launching a new network technology.

## 8. Product-Line Competition: Customization vs. Proliferation
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 7 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
We study a market with customers who have heterogeneous preferences for product attributes. We consider two types of firms that compete on price and product variety: A traditional firm, which chooses a limited set of product configurations, and a customizing firm, which can produce any configuration to order. The traditional firm carries product inventories and experiences a lead-time delay. The customizing firm does not carry inventory, and its customers incur waiting costs until they receive their orders. We assume that the customizing firm has limited capacity in the short run (e.g., when it does not outsource production to high-volume manufacturers). We derive the equilibrium for a duopoly competition between the customizing firm and the traditional firm, study its characteristics, and compare it to a monopoly. We characterize conditions that favor customization under competition. We find that the customizing firm's profit is not monotone in the market size and its ease of customization. Similarly, a decline in the traditional firm's holding cost may increase or decrease its profit. We show that the unit cost differential between the firms crucially affects the customizing firm's ideal market size, its returns from expanding capacity, its product variety, and the way operational improvements affect its performance.

## 9. R&D/Returns Causality: Absorptive Capacity or Organizational IQ
### Author(s):
- Anne Marie Knott
### Published:
- 5 Nov 2008
### Abstract:
Absorptive capacity is the principle that assimilating new knowledge requires prior knowledge. The attendant prescription is to invest more in R&D to derive greater benefit from the R&D of others (spillovers). Empirical tests of R&D productivity typically find absorptive capacity (R&D * rival R&D) to be significant. This result poses a puzzle, however: What can a firm conducting 50% of industry R&D learn from a set of firms each conducting 5%? Aren't the laggard firms merely playing catch-up? Yet, if this is so, why is the interaction term significant?

## 10. Affine General Equilibrium Models
### Author(s):
- Bjrn Eraker
### Published:
- 11 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
No-arbitrage models are extremely flexible modelling tools but often lack economic motivation. This paper describes an equilibrium consumption-based CAPM framework based on Epstein-Zin preferences, which produces analytic pricing formulas for stocks and bonds under the assumption that macro growth rates follow affine processes. This allows the construction of equilibrium pricing formulas while maintaining the same flexibility of state dynamics as in no-arbitrage models. In demonstrating the approach, the paper presents a model that incorporates inflation such that asset prices are nominal. The model takes advantage of the possibility of non-Gaussian shocks and model macroeconomic uncertainty as a jump-diffusion process. This leads to endogenous stock market crashes as stock prices drop to reflect a higher expected rate of return in response to sudden increases in risk. The nominal yield curve in this model has a positive slope if expected inflation growth negatively impacts real growth. This model also produces asset prices that are consistent with observed data, including a substantial equity premium at moderate levels of risk aversion.

## 11. Technical NotePrice Promotions in Asymmetric Duopolies with Heterogeneous Consumers
### Author(s):
- Maxim Sinitsyn
### Published:
- 1 Dec 2008
### Abstract:
In this note I investigate the outcome of a static price competition between a strong firm (a firm with an established loyal consumer base) and a weak firm (a firm without loyal consumers). The consumers are divided into the strong firm's loyal segment and the switching segment, members of which have heterogeneous tastes for the firms' products. In the presence of loyal consumers, for a large set of the parameters of the demand function, the firms use mixed strategies over a finite number of prices. These strategies can be interpreted as occurrences of sales. The most common case is that of the strong firm's using two prices and the weak firm's using one price. However, when both firms use sales, the weak firm promotes more often than the strong firm.
