## 2. Joint Bidding in the Name-Your-Own-Price Channel: A Strategic Analysis

### Abstract:
In this paper, we study the name-your-own-price (NYOP) channel. We examine theoretically and empirically whether asking consumers to place a joint bid for multiple items, rather than bid one item at a time as practiced today, can increase NYOP retailers' profits. Relatedly, we also examine whether allowing consumers to self-select whether to place a joint bid or itemwise bids increases retailers' profits and consumers' surplus. We construct a dynamic model that incorporates both demand uncertainty and supply uncertainty to address these issues. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which joint bidding can increase both NYOP retailers' profits and consumers' surplus. We find that some consumers might bid more for the very same items when they place joint bids. The increase in bid amount is related to the fact that joint bidding reduces the chance of mismatch between NYOP retailers' costs and consumer bids. We conducted a laboratory study to assess the descriptive validity of some of the model predictions, because there are no field data on joint bidding in the NYOP channel. The results of the study are directionally consistent with our theory.

## 3. Financial Reporting and Conflicting Managerial Incentives: The Case of Management Buyouts
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We analyze the effect of external financing concerns on managers' financial reporting behavior prior to management buyouts (MBOs). Prior studies hypothesize that managers intending to undertake an MBO have an incentive to manage earnings downward to reduce the purchase price. We hypothesize that managers also face a conflicting reporting incentive associated with their efforts to obtain external financing for the MBO and to lower their financing cost. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that managers who rely the most on external funds to finance their MBOs tend to report less negative abnormal accrual prior to the MBOs. In addition, the relation between external financing and abnormal accruals is tempered when there are more fixed assets that can serve as collateral for debt financing.

## 4. Diversity in Resource Consumption Patterns and Robustness of Costing Systems to Errors
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Practitioners and academics hypothesize that when there is high diversity in resource consumption patterns, costing systems are more sensitive to errors. Given that firms' resources to enhance costing accuracy are typically constrained, it is argued that costing system refinement efforts should be focused on such cases, where they are likely to be most effective. However, little guidance is available on how to identify those situations where costing system refinement efforts (such as introducing an activity-based costing system) are likely to pay off most in terms of increased accuracy. Further, to our knowledge, the existing guidance provided by this high diversity rule of thumb has never been empirically tested. Using a simulation method, we address these issues in this paper. Specifically, we model various aspects, and degrees, of diversity in the resource consumption patterns to be reflected by the costing system and find that more diversity in resource consumption patterns only leads to increased costing system sensitivity to errors for some of the aspects of diversity studied. We also identify situations in which allocating costing system refinement resources to cases characterized by high diversity in resource consumption patterns is detrimental to improved accuracy.

## 5. Remanufacturing as a Marketing Strategy

### Published:
- 8 Aug 2008
### Abstract:
The profitability of remanufacturing systems for different cost, technology, and logistics structures has been extensively investigated in the literature. We provide an alternative and somewhat complementary approach that considers demand-related issues, such as the existence of green segments, original equipment manufacturer competition, and product life-cycle effects. The profitability of a remanufacturing system strongly depends on these issues as well as on their interactions. For a monopolist, we show that there exist thresholds on the remanufacturing cost savings, the green segment size, market growth rate, and consumer valuations for the remanufactured products, above which remanufacturing is profitable. More important, we show that under competition remanufacturing can become an effective marketing strategy, which allows the manufacturer to defend its market share via price discrimination.

## 6. The Make-or-Buy Decision in the Presence of a Rival: Strategic Outsourcing to a Common Supplier
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
Firms routinely decide whether to make essential inputs themselves or buy the inputs from independent suppliers. Conventional wisdom suggests that a firm will not buy an input for a price above its in-house cost of production. We show that this is not necessarily the case when a monopolistic input supplier also serves the firm's retail rival. In this case, the decision to buy the input (and thus become one of the supplier's customers) can limit the incentive the supplier would otherwise have to provide the input on particularly favorable terms to the retail rival. Thus, a retail competitor may pay a premium to outsource production to a common supplier in order to raise its rivals' costs.

## 7. Strategic Customer Behavior, Commitment, and Supply Chain Performance
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
This paper studies the impact of strategic customer behavior on supply chain performance. We start with a newsvendor seller facing forward-looking customers. The seller initially charges a regular price but may salvage the leftover inventory at a lower salvage price after random demand is realized. Customers anticipate future sales and choose purchase timing to maximize their expected surplus. We characterize the rational expectations equilibrium, where we find that the seller's stocking level is lower than that in the classic model without strategic customers. We show that the seller's profit can be improved by promising either that quantities available will be limited (quantity commitment) or that prices will be kept high (price commitment). In most cases, both forms of commitment are not credible in a centralized supply chain with a single seller. However, decentralized supply chains can use contractual arrangements as indirect commitment devices to attain the desired outcomes with commitment. Decentralization has generally been associated with coordination problems, but we present the contrasting view that disparate interests within a supply chain can actually improve overall supply chain performance. In particular, with strategic customer behavior, we find that (i) a decentralized supply chain with a wholesale price contract may perform strictly better than a centralized supply chain; (ii) contracts widely studied in the supply chain coordination literature (e.g., markdown money, sales rebates, and buyback contracts) can serve as a commitment device as well as an incentive-coordinating device; and (iii) some of the above contracts cannot allocate profits arbitrarily between supply chain members because of strategic customer behavior.

## 8. Estimating the Influence of Fairness on Bargaining Behavior
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 31 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
The strength of bargainers' preferences for fair settlements has important implications for predicting negotiation outcomes and guiding bargaining strategy. Existing literature reports a few calibration exercises for social utility models, but the predictive accuracy of these models for out-of-sample forecasting remains unknown. Therefore, we investigate whether fairness considerations are stable enough across bargaining situations to be quantified and used to forecast bargaining behavior accurately. We develop a model that embeds a preference for fair treatment in a quantal response framework to account for noise and experience. In addition, we estimate preference for fairness (willingness to pay) using the simplest, one-round version of sequential bargaining games and then employ it to perform out-of-sample forecasts of multiple-round games of various lengths, discount factors, pie sizes, and levels of bargainer experience. Except in circumstances in which the bargaining pie is very small, the fitted model has significant and substantial out-of-sample explanatory power. The stability we find implies that the model and techniques might ultimately be extended to estimates of the influence of fairness on field negotiations, as well as across subpopulations.

## 9. Strategic Inventories in Vertical Contracts
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Aug 2008
### Abstract:
Classical reasons for carrying inventory include fixed (nonlinear) production or procurement costs, lead times, nonstationary or uncertain supply/demand, and capacity constraints. The last decade has seen active research in supply chain coordination focusing on the role of incentive contracts to achieve first-best levels of inventory. An extensive literature in industrial organization that studies incentives for vertical controls largely ignores the effect of inventories. Does the ability to carry inventory influence the problem of vertical control? Conversely, can inventories arise purely due to incentive effects? This paper explicitly considers both incentives and inventories, and their interplay, in a dynamic model of an upstream firm (supplier) and a downstream firm (buyer) who can carry inventories. In our model, none of the classical reasons for carrying inventory exists. However, as we prove, the buyer's optimal strategy in equilibrium is to carry inventories, and the supplier is unable to prevent this. These inventories arise out of purely strategic considerations not yet identified in the literature, and have a significant impact on the equilibrium solution as well as supplier, buyer, and channel profits.

## 10. Inventory Management Under Market Size Dynamics
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 8 Aug 2008
### Abstract:
We investigate the situation where a customer experiencing an inventory stockout at a retailer potentially leaves the firm's market. In classical inventory theory, a unit stockout penalty cost has been used as a surrogate to mimic the economic effect of such a departure; in this study, we explicitly represent this aspect of consumer behavior, incorporating the diminishing effect of the consumers leaving the market upon the stochastic demand distribution in a time-dynamic context. The initial model considers a single firm. We allow for consumer forgiveness where customers may flow back to the committed purchasing market from a nonpurchasing latent market. The per-period decisions include a marketing mix to attract latent and new consumers to the committed market and the setting of inventory levels. We establish conditions under which the firm optimally operates a base-stock inventory policy. The subsequent two models consider a duopoly where the potential market for a firm is now the committed market of the other firm; each firm decides its own inventory level. In the first model, the only decisions are the stocking decisions and in the second model, a firm may also advertise to attract dissatisfied customers from its competitor's market. In both cases, we establish conditions for a base-stock equilibrium policy. We demonstrate comparative statics in all models.

## 11. Properties of the Social Discount Rate in a Benthamite Framework with Heterogeneous Degrees of Impatience

### Published:
- 19 May 2008
### Abstract:
This paper derives the properties of the discount rate that should be applied to a public-sector project when the affected population has heterogeneous degrees of impatience. We show that, for any distribution of discount rates, the social discount rate has the following properties: it decreases over time, it is lower than the average of the discount rates in the population, and it converges to the discount rate of the most patient individual in the economy. These properties hold for both constant and decreasing individual discount rates. Finally, we evaluate how changes in the distribution of individual discount rates affect the social discount rate.

## 12. Statement from the Editor Regarding Properties of the Social Discount Rate in a Benthamite Framework with Heterogeneous Degrees of Impatience
### Author(s):
- Wallace J. Hopp
### Published:
- 1 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
In the original version of the paper Properties of the Social Discount Rate in a Benthamite Framework with Heterogeneous Degrees of Impatience by Diego Nocetti (Management Science, Articles in Advance, January 25, 2008), Proposition 2 stated that First and second order stochastically dominated shifts in the distribution of the individual discount rates reduce the SDR. However, Elys Jouini and Clotilde Napp pointed out that this is not always the case, noting that although first and second order stochastically dominated shifts in the distribution of discount rates increase the present value of the project, they are neither necessary nor sufficient to decrease the SDR for all horizons.

## 13. Research NoteAre Store-Brand Buyers Store Loyal? An Empirical Investigation
### Author(s):
- Karsten Hansen
- Vishal Singh
### Published:
- 19 May 2008
### Abstract:
This paper tests the notion of whether high preference for store brands leads to higher store loyalty. Our work differs from the earlier empirical evidence on this issue in how we define and measure the two key constructs: store-brand loyalty and store loyalty. To measure store-brand preference, we develop a multicategory brand choice to elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands, while controlling for other factors such as price sensitivity. The household-specific measures on store-brand preference and price sensitivity (along with other control variables) are then used to assess household store loyalty in the context of entry by a Wal-Mart supercenter in the market. Results show that store-brand buying behavior is driven by households' underlying value trait over and beyond what is captured by price sensitivity alone. In addition, these value-oriented households, which show high preference for store brands in the pre-entry period, shift a significantly higher level of their expenditures to Wal-Mart. These results are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom that high store-brand patronage is associated with a higher level of store loyalty. However, this finding comes with the caveat that the entrant analyzed in the paper has a well-defined value positioning and might not hold if the new entrant does not dominate the incumbent in the value proposition. Implications for supermarket managers in a more general context are discussed.
