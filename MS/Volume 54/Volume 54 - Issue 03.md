### Abstract:
This paper studies the influence of supply-side and demand-side factors on the compensation of information technology (IT) professionals and considers the human capital and institutional explanations. We focus on returns to an MBA and the IT-related experience of IT professionals and use the largest data set of IT professionals that has been compiled to date in the United States to answer our research questions. We find that firms pay a significant premium for an MBA. Although firms value the IT experience of IT professionals, they value an MBA significantly more. The results of this study cast doubt on the belief that IT skills have a large firm-specific component. Although IT experience is valued more than non-IT experience for IT professionals, firms value IT experience at other firms much more than they value firm-specific IT experience. Likewise, contrary to popular perception, we do not find evidence for complementarities between an MBA education and IT experience. Among institutional effects, firms in IT and IT-intensive industries pay significantly more to IT professionals than do other firms, and dot-com firms also paid a significant premium in 1999 and 2000. However, these firms do not value an MBA or firm-specific IT experience any more than other firms. We discuss the implications of these findings for further research, for firms' compensation practices, and for individual IT professionals.

## 3. Managerial Expertise, Private Information, and Pay-Performance Sensitivity
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
This paper characterizes optimal pay-performance sensitivities of compensation contracts for managers who have private information about their skills, and those skills affect their outside employment opportunities. The model presumes that the rate at which a manager's opportunity wage increases in his expertise depends on the nature of that expertise, i.e., whether it is general or firm specific. The analysis demonstrates that when managerial expertise is largely firm specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity is lower (higher) than its optimal value in a benchmark setting of symmetric information. Furthermore, when managerial skills are largely firm specific (general), the optimal pay-performance sensitivity decreases (increases) as managerial skills become a more important determinant of firm performance. Unlike the standard agency-theoretic prediction of a negative trade-off between risk and pay-performance sensitivity, this paper identifies plausible circumstances under which risk and incentives are positively associated. In addition to providing an explanation for why empirical tests of risk-incentive relationships have produced mixed results, the analysis generates insights that can be useful in guiding future empirical research.

## 4. Foreign Investments of U.S. Individual Investors: Causes and Consequences

### Abstract:
Using thousands of brokerage accounts of U.S. individual investors, we analyze the motivations and consequences of foreign equity investment. We find that diversification is not the only reason that investors trade foreign securities. While wealthier, more experienced investors enjoy an informational advantage and, thus, are more likely to invest overseas and experience good portfolio performance, other investors appear to venture abroad for the wrong reasons. In particular, behaviorally biased investors often underuse or misuse foreign equity securities and experience poor portfolio performance. Some investors appear to use foreign securities for speculation or to improve upon poor domestic portfolio performance.

## 5. The Sound of Silence in Online Feedback: Estimating Trading Risks in the Presence of Reporting Bias
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
Most online feedback mechanisms rely on voluntary reporting of privately observed outcomes. This introduces the potential for reporting bias, a situation where traders exhibit different propensities to report different outcome types to the system. Unless properly accounted for, reporting bias may severely distort the distribution of public feedback relative to the underlying distribution of private transaction outcomes and, thus, hamper the reliability of feedback mechanisms. This study offers a method that allows users of feedback mechanisms where both partners of a bilateral exchange are allowed to report their satisfaction to see through the distortions introduced by reporting bias and derive unbiased estimates of the underlying distribution of privately observed outcomes. A key aspect of our method lies in extracting information from the number of transactions where one or both trading partners choose to remain silent. We apply our method to a large data set of eBay feedback. Our results support the widespread belief that eBay traders are more likely to post feedback when satisfied than when dissatisfied and are consistent with the presence of positive and negative reciprocation among eBay traders. Most importantly, our analysis derives unbiased estimates of the risks that are associated with trading on eBay that, we believe, are more realistic than those suggested by a nave interpretation of the unusually high (>99%) levels of positive feedback currently found on that system.

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
As a new type of word-of-mouth information, online consumer product review is an emerging market phenomenon that is playing an increasingly important role in consumers' purchase decisions. This paper argues that online consumer review, a type of product information created by users based on personal usage experience, can serve as a new element in the marketing communications mix and work as free sales assistants to help consumers identify the products that best match their idiosyncratic usage conditions.

## 7. The Predictive Power of Three Prominent Tournament Formats
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Jan 2008
### Abstract:
Tournaments of heterogeneous candidates can be thought of as probabilistic mechanisms that select high-quality agents. We quantify the efficiency of such selection by the likelihood of selecting the best player, here termed the predictive power. We study three widely used tournament formats: contests, binary elimination tournaments, and round-robin tournaments. Using a simple model, we demonstrate analytically, and through simulations, how the predictive power of these formats depends on the number of players, noise level, and distribution of players' types. We also present the results of exploratory simulations for two alternative criteria of selection efficiency: the expected ability of the winner and the expected rank of the winner. All three criteria may exhibit unexpected nonmonotonic behavior as functions of the number of players and/or noise level. We discuss the conditions under which different types of behavior should be expected, and their implications for managerial decisions.

## 8. Corporate Venturing, Allocation of Talent, and Competition for Star Managers
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Dec 2007
### Abstract:
We provide new rationales for corporate venturing, based on competition for talented managers. As returns to venturing increase, firms engage in corporate venturing for reasons other than capturing these returns. First, higher venturing returns increase managerial compensation, to which firms respond by increasing incentives. Managers increase effort, prompting firms to reallocate them to new ventures, where the marginal product of effort is highest. Second, as returns to venturing become large, corporate venturing emerges as a way to recruit/retain managers who would otherwise choose alternative employment. We derive several testable empirical predictions about the determinants and structure of corporate venturing.

## 9. Pricing and Operational Recourse in Coproduction Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
Coproduction systems, in which multiple products are produced simultaneously in a single production run, are prevalent in many industries. Such systems typically produce a random quantity of vertically differentiated products. This product hierarchy enables the firm to fill demand for a lower-quality product by converting a higher-quality product. In addition to the challenges presented by random yields and multiple products, coproduction systems often serve multiple customer classes that differ in their product valuations. Furthermore, the sizes of these classes are uncertain. Employing a utility-maximizing customer model, we investigate the production, pricing, downconversion, and allocation decisions in a two-class, stochastic-demand, stochastic-yield coproduction system. For the single-class case, we establish that downconversion will not occur if prices are set optimally. In contrast, we show that downconversion can be optimal in the two-class case, even if prices are set optimally. We consider the benefit of postponing certain operational decisions, e.g., the pricing or allocation-rule decisions, until after uncertainties are resolved. We use the term recourse to denote actions taken after uncertainties have been resolved. We find that recourse pricing benefits the firm much more than either downconversion or recourse allocation do, implying that recourse demand management is more valuable than recourse supply management. Special cases of our model include the single-class and two-class random-yield newsvendor models.

## 10. A Simultaneous Model of Consumer Brand Choice and Negotiated Price

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a simultaneous model of consumer brand choice and negotiated price in the highly relevant marketing context of automobile transactions. Consumer brand choice is modeled as a multinomial probabilistic outcome, and the individual consumer-level transaction price is modeled to be consistent with the Nash bargaining solution. Our simultaneous model introduces a natural way to account for price endogeneity in a microlevel choice setting when the price paid is individual specific and correlated with the idiosyncratic preference of a buyer. It also accounts for the potential selectivity bias in studying the negotiated price by integrating consumer brand choice modeling. We apply the proposed model to a data set of 4,795 consumer automobile purchases. The empirical results show that the proposed approach not only better fits the data of consumer choice and negotiated price, but it also provides additional insights into buyers' and sellers' behaviors in comparison with models that study only consumer choice or the negotiated price, but not both simultaneously.

### Published:
- 1 Mar 2008
### Abstract:
A callable product is a unit of capacity sold to self-selected low-fare customers who willingly grant the capacity provider the option to call the capacity at a prespecified recall price. We analyze callable products in a finite-capacity setting with two fare classes where low-fare customers book first, and show that callable products provide a riskless source of additional revenue to the capacity provider. An optimal recall price and an optimal discount-fare booking limit for the two-period problem are obtained. Numerical examples show the benefits from offering callable products can be significant, especially when high-fare demand uncertainty is large. Extensions to multifare structures, network models, overbooking, and to other industries are discussed.

## 12. Scheduling Arrivals to Queues: A Single-Server Model with No-Shows
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jan 2008
### Abstract:
Queueing systems with scheduled arrivals, i.e., appointment systems, are typical for frontal service systems, e.g., health clinics. An aspect of customer behavior that influences the overall efficiency of such systems is the phenomenon of no-shows. The consequences of no-shows cannot be underestimated; e.g., British surveys reveal that in the United Kingdom alone more than 12 million general practitioner (GP) appointments are missed every year, costing the British health service an estimated 250 million annually. In this study we answer the following key questions: How should the schedule be computed when there are no-shows? Is it sufficiently accurate to use a schedule designed for the same expected number of customers without no-shows? How important is it to invest in efforts that reduce no-showsi.e., given that we apply a schedule that takes no-shows into consideration, is the existence of no-shows still costly to the server and customers?

## 13. Incorporating Asymmetric Distributional Information in Robust Value-at-Risk Optimization
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 14 Jan 2008
### Abstract:
Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the most widely accepted risk measures in the financial and insurance industries, yet efficient optimization of VaR remains a very difficult problem. We propose a computationally tractable approximation method for minimizing the VaR of a portfolio based on robust optimization techniques. The method results in the optimization of a modified VaR measure, Asymmetry-Robust VaR (ARVaR), that takes into consideration asymmetries in the distributions of returns and is coherent, which makes it desirable from a financial theory perspective. We show that ARVaR approximates the Conditional VaR of the portfolio as well. Numerical experiments with simulated and real market data indicate that the proposed approach results in lower realized portfolio VaR, better efficient frontier, and lower maximum realized portfolio loss than alternative approaches for quantile-based portfolio risk minimization.

## 14. Mean Variance Vulnerability
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jan 2008
### Abstract:
This paper transfers the concept of Gollier and Pratt's (Gollier, C., J. W. Pratt. 1996. Risk vulnerability and the tempering effect of background risk. Econometrica64 11091123) risk vulnerability into mean variance preferences. Risk vulnerability is shown to be equivalent to the slope of the mean variance indifference curve being decreasing in mean and increasing in variance. Next, we introduce the notion of mean variance vulnerability to link the concepts of decreasing absolute risk aversion, risk vulnerability, properness, and standardness. All of the abovementioned concepts are characterized in terms of mean variance indifference curve properties and in terms of absolute risk measures.

## 15. Allocation Models and Heuristics for the Outsourcing of Repairs for a Dynamic Warranty Population
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Nov 2007
### Abstract:
We consider a scenario in which a large equipment manufacturer wishes to outsource the work involved in repairing purchased goods while under warranty. Several external service vendors are available for this work. We develop models and analyses to support decisions concerning how responsibility for the warranty population should be divided between them. These also allow the manufacturer to resolve related questions concerning, for example, whether the service capacities of the contracted vendors are sufficient to deliver an effective post-sales service. Static allocation models yield information concerning the proportions of the warranty population for which the vendors should be responsible overall. Dynamic allocation models enable consideration of how such overall workloads might be delivered to the vendors over time in a way which avoids excessive variability in the repair burden. We apply dynamic programming policy improvement to develop an effective dynamic allocation heuristic. This is evaluated numerically and is also used as a yardstick to assess two simple allocation heuristics suggested by static models. A dynamic greedy allocation heuristic is found to perform well. Dividing the workload equally among vendors with different service capacities can lead to serious losses.

## 16. Customized Bundle Pricing for Information Goods: A Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Programming Approach
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
This paper proposes using nonlinear mixed-integer programming to solve the customized bundle-pricing problem in which consumers are allowed to choose up to N goods out of a larger pool of J goods. Prior work has suggested that this mechanism has attractive features for the pricing of information and other low-marginal cost goods. Although closed-form solutions exist for this problem for certain cases of consumer preferences, many interesting scenarios cannot be easily handled without a numerical solution procedure. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency gains created by customized bundling over the alternatives of pure bundling or individual sale under different assumptions about customer preferences and firm cost structure, as well as the potential loss of efficiency caused by pricing with incomplete information about consumer reservation values. Our analysis suggests that customized bundling enhances sellers' profits and enhances welfare when consumers do not place positive values on all goods, and that this consumer characteristic is much more important than the shape of the valuation distribution in determining the optimal pricing scheme. We also find that customized bundling outperforms both pure bundling and individual sale in the presence of incomplete information, and that customized bundling still outperforms other simpler pricing schemes even when exact consumer valuations are not known ex ante.

## 17. Research NoteRevisiting Retailer- vs. Vendor-Managed Inventory and Brand Competition
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
In a recent paper, Mishra and Raghunathan (Mishra, B. K., S. Raghunathan. 2004. Retailer- vs. vendor-managed inventory and brand competition. Management Sci.50(4) 445457) claimed that retailers prefer vendor-managed inventory (VMI) because it restores competition among manufacturers and encourages them to maintain a higher stock of their own brand under VMI than would be maintained under retailer-managed inventory (RMI). This paper shows that these results do not hold in general: each manufacturer's stocking level may be higher under RMI than under VMI and the retailer may lose by adopting VMI depending on the profit margin of the retailer relative to that of the manufacturers, the magnitude of the holding costs, and the intensity of brand competition. Numerical examples show that the effect of brand competition on the system is not so significant and the transfer of holding cost to the vendor is the key incentive for the retailer's adoption of VMI.
