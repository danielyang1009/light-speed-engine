## 2. Innovation Contests, Open Innovation, and Multiagent Problem Solving

### Abstract:
In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation-related problem (e.g., a technical R&D problem) posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the contest approach to innovation.

### Abstract:
We take advantage of recent advances in optimization methods and computer hardware to identify globally optimal solutions of product line design problems that are too large for complete enumeration. We then use this guarantee of global optimality to benchmark the performance of more practical heuristic methods. We use two sources of data: (1) a conjoint study previously conducted for a real product line design problem, and (2) simulated problems of various sizes. For both data sources, several of the heuristic methods consistently find optimal or near-optimal solutions, including simulated annealing, divide-and-conquer, product-swapping, and genetic algorithms.

### Abstract:
Every organization is confronted by employee errors. Situational learning orientation may mitigate an employee's tendency to err. A situational learning orientation refers to the extent to which employees share the perception that there is an emphasis on improvement and on actively searching for additional knowledge and feedback in their department. The present study suggests that situational learning orientation interacts with two other organizational factorsautonomy and voiceas it influences employee errors, using the example of resident physicians' medical treatment errors. Senior nurses tallied the number of errors made by 123 residents from 25 departments over a three-month period. Results demonstrated that encouraging employee autonomy and voice fosters the benefits of learning by decreasing the number of treatment errors. Specifically, when the situational learning orientation was high, the number of errors decreased at an increasing rate as the perceived autonomy increased. When the learning orientation was low, there was a u-shaped relationship between autonomy and number of errors. In addition, only when the situational learning orientation was high did a higher employee voice lead to fewer treatment errors.

## 5. Videoconferencing in the Field: A Heuristic Processing Model
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
This research uses dual-process cognitive theory to describe how people process information differently when it is delivered via videoconference rather than when it is delivered face-to-face. According to this theory, relative to face-to-face communication, people in videoconferences tend to be more influenced by heuristic cuessuch as how likeable they perceive the speaker to bethan by the quality of the arguments presented by the speaker. This is due to the higher cognitive demands that videoconferencing places on participants. We report on a field study of medical professionals in which we found differences in information processing as predicted: participants attending a seminar via videoconference were more influenced by the likeability of the speaker than by the quality of the arguments presented, whereas the opposite pattern was true for participants attending in-person. We also found that differences in cognitive load explain these effects. The discussion on the theoretical model and associated findings explains why prior videoconference studies have not consistently found main effects for media. The findings also show that videoconferencing is not like face-to-face communication, despite apparent similarities.

### Abstract:
Content delivery networks (CDNs) are a vital component of the Internet's content delivery value chain, servicing nearly a third of the Internet's most popular content sites. However, in spite of their strategic importance, little is known about the optimal pricing policies or adoption drivers of CDNs. We address these questions using analytic models of CDN pricing and adoption under Markovian traffic and extend the results to bursty traffic using numerical simulations.

### Published:
- 10 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we consider the classical multifare, single-resource (leg) problem in revenue management for the case where demand information is limited. Our approach employs a competitive analysis, which guarantees a certain performance level under all possible demand scenarios. The only information required about the demand for each fare class is lower and upper bounds. We consider both competitive ratio and absolute regret performance criteria. For both performance criteria, we derive the best possible static policies, which employ booking limits that remain constant throughout the booking horizon. The optimal policies have the form of nested booking limits. Dynamic policies, which employ booking limits that may be adjusted at any time based on the history of bookings, are also obtained. We provide extensive computational experiments and compare our methods to existing ones. The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these new robust methods.

## 8. Revenue Ranking of Discriminatory and Uniform Auctions with an Unknown Number of Bidders
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
An important managerial question is the choice of the pricing rule. We study whether this choice depends on the uncertainty about the number of participating bidders by comparing expected revenues under discriminatory and uniform pricing within an auction model with affiliated values, stochastic number of bidders, and linear bidding strategies. We show that if uncertainty about the number of bidders is substantial, then the discriminatory pricing generates higher expected revenues than the uniform pricing. In particular, the first-price auction might generate higher revenues than the second-price auction. Therefore, uncertainty about the number of bidders is an important factor to consider when choosing the pricing rule. We also study whether eliminating this uncertainty, i.e., revealing the number of bidders, is in the seller's interests, and discuss the existence of an increasing symmetric equilibrium.

## 9. When Rational Sellers Face Nonrational Buyers: Evidence from Herding on eBay
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 25 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
People often observe others' decisions before deciding themselves. Using eBay data for DVD auctions we explore the consequences of neglecting nonsalient information when making such inferences. We show that bidders herd into auctions with more existing bids, even if these are a signal of no-longer-available lower starting prices rather than of higher quality. Bidders bidding a given dollar amount are less likely to win low starting price auctions, and pay more for them when they do win. Experienced bidders are less likely to bid on low starting price auctions. Remarkably, the seller side of the market is in equilibrium, because expected revenues are nearly identical for high and low starting prices.

## 10. Choice Interactions and Business Strategy
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 21 Jul 2008
### Abstract:
Choice settings are strategic to the extent that they entail cross-sectional or intertemporal linkages. These same factors may impose daunting demands on decision makers. We develop a graph-theoretic generalization of the NK model of fitness landscapes to model the way in which policy choices may be more or less strategic. We use this structure to examine, through simulation, how fully articulated a strategy or set of policy choices must be to achieve a high level of performance and how feasible it is to offset past strategic mistakes through tactical adjustments (instead of alignment). Our analysis highlights the role of asymmetry in the interaction of strategic choices and in particular the degree to which choices vary in terms of being influential, dependent, or autonomous from other choices.

## 11. Look Before You Leap: Market Opportunity Identification in Emerging Technology Firms

### Published:

### Abstract:
Entrepreneurs play a fundamental role in bringing new technologies to market. Because technologies are often configurable to serve a variety of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify multiple market opportunities prior to the first market entry of their emerging firms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore have a choice of which market to enter first. The empirical results presented in this paper offer three new insights regarding this important early-stage choice in new firm creation. First, they reveal that serial entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to generate a choice set of alternative market opportunities before deciding which one to pursue in their new firm creation. Second, the analysis indicates that entrepreneurs who identify a choice set of market opportunities prior to first entry derive performance benefits by doing so. Third, the positive relationship between the number of market opportunities identified prior to first entry and new firm performance is nonlinear and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has yet to acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting the most favorable market opportunity for the creation of a new technology firm.

## 12. Integrating the Number and Location of Retail Outlets on a Line with Replenishment Decisions
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We research the management approach that quantitatively combines decisions that affect different planning horizonsnamely, the strategic and operational onesand simultaneously derive the optimal values of these decisions. The system we investigate comprises retail outlets and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both retail outlets and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values of the number of retail outlets, the location of each retail outlet, and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each retail outlet. We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the retail outlets, the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented as a function of the number of retail outlets. Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of retail outlets. We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quantification of this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters. In addition, we point out several managerial insights.
