## 2. Social Preferences and Supply Chain Performance: An Experimental Study

### Abstract:
Supply chain contracting literature has traditionally focused on aligning incentives for economically rational players. Recent work has hypothesized that social preferences, as distinct from economic incentives, may influence behavior in supply chain transactions. Social preferences refer to intrinsic concerns for the other party's welfare, reciprocating a history of a positive relationship, and intrinsic desires for a higher relative payoff compared with the other party's when status is salient. This article provides experimental evidence that social preferences systematically affect economic decision making in supply chain transactions. Specifically, supply chain parties deviate from the predictions provided by self-interested profit-maximization models, such that relationship preference promotes cooperation, individual performance, and high system efficiency, sustainable over time; whereas status preference induces tough actions and reduces both system efficiency and individual performance.

## 3. Friction in Related-Party Trade When a Rival Is Also a Customer

### Abstract:
There are many circumstances in which manufacturers provide inputs to wholesale customers only to subsequently compete with these wholesale customers in the retail realm. Such dual distribution arrangements commonly suffer from excessive encroachment in that the manufacturer's ex post retail aggression is harmful ex ante because it undercuts potential wholesale profits. This paper demonstrates that with dual distribution, a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control and the use of transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of such concerns permits the manufacturer to credibly convey to its wholesale customer that it will not excessively encroach on its retail territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture.

## 4. Market-Based Supply Chain Coordination by Matching Suppliers' Cost Structures with Buyers' Order Profiles

### Abstract:
We study competitive marketplaces with multiple suppliers and multiple buyers dealing with a single product. A buyer chooses the supplier who offers the best price for his order profile, as described by his order size and delivery frequency. A supplier's offering price reflects her logistic cost structure as captured by relevant economies of scale in a setup cost component, and storage- and distribution-related costs in a holding cost per unit component. We argue that the matching of buyers' order profiles to suppliers' cost structures is the main source of supply chain coordination benefit in this many-to-many supply chain. Such cost-effective matching can be achieved naturally through price competition among suppliers. We identify the segment of the buyer's order space that each supplier can win, and perform market share sensitivity analysis when a supplier's cost structure changes. The winning supplier, at the equilibrium of price competition, offers the lowest price of her closest competitor instead of the lowest price she can offer.

## 5. Capacity Investment Under Postponement Strategies, Market Competition, and Demand Uncertainty
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
We consider duopoly models where firms make decisions on capacity, production, and price under demand uncertainty. Capacity and price decisions are made, respectively, ex ante and ex post demand realizations. The interplay between the timings of demand realization and production decision endows firms with different capabilities. Flexible firms can postpone production decisions until the actual demand curve is observed, but inflexible firms cannot. Under general demand structures and cost functions, we characterize the equilibrium for a symmetric duopoly and establish the strategic equivalence of price and quantity competitions when firms are flexible. We investigate the stochastic order properties of capacity and profit and show that they both increase for a flexible firm when the market is more volatile. We find that flexibility allows a firm to increase investment in capacity and earn a higher profit while benefiting customers by keeping the price in a narrower range; strategic equivalence implies that these properties are robust to market conjectures. We also show that flexibility plays an important role in mitigating the destructive effect of competition when the demand shock is additive; the destructive effect is nonexistent for firms facing multiplicative demand shock. When flexibility decision is endogenous, a firm's strategic flexibility choice depends on the cost of technology as well as the nature of demand shock. In particular, faced with a multiplicative demand shock, firms always choose to be inflexible, whereas all the possible equilibria are observed under additive demand shocks.

## 6. Ethical Spillovers in Firms: Evidence from Vehicle Emissions Testing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 10 Oct 2008
### Abstract:
In this paper, we explore how organizations influence the unethical behavior of their employees. Using a unique data set of over three million vehicle emissions tests, we find strong evidence of ethical spillovers from firms to individuals. When inspectors work across different organizations, they adjust the rate at which they pass vehicles to the norms of those with whom they work. These spillovers are strongest at large facilities and corporate chains, and weakest for the large-volume inspectors. These results are consistent with the economics literature on productivity spillovers from organizations and peers and suggest that managers can influence the ethics of employee behavior through both formal norms and incentives. The results also suggest that employees have persistent ethics that limit the magnitude of this influence. These results imply that if ethical conformity is important to the financial and legal health of the organization, managers must be vigilant in their hiring, training, and monitoring to ensure that employee behavior is consistent with firm objectives.

## 7. Competing Through Cooperation: The Organization of Standard Setting in Wireless Telecommunications
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 17 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
This study examines cooperative standard setting in wireless telecommunications. Focusing on the competition among firms to influence formal standardization, the roles of standard-setting committees, private alliances, and industry consortia are highlighted. The empirical context is Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an international standards-development organization in the wireless telecommunication industry. Panel data analyses exploiting natural experiments caused by a consortium merger and entry of Asian firms suggest that participation in industry consortia increases firms' contributions to the development of new technical specifications in 3GPP committees. Moreover, connections to standard-setting peers formed in consortia facilitate change requests to ongoing specifications. These results suggest that if firms in network technology industries want to influence the evolution of their industry, they should identify both formal standard-setting committees and industry consortia in which they can discuss, negotiate, and align positions on technical features with their peers. For policymakers, these results suggest that it is important to ensure that technical consortia remain open for all industry actors and that membership fees do not become prohibitive to small and resource-constrained players.

## 8. Patents and the Performance of Voluntary Standard-Setting Organizations
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 30 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
Voluntary standard-setting organizations (SSOs) are a common feature of systems industries, where firms supply interoperable components for a shared technology platform. These institutions promote coordinated innovation by providing a forum for collective decision making and a potential solution to the problem of fragmented and overlapping intellectual property rights. This paper examines the economic and technological significance of SSOs by analyzing the flow of citations to a sample of U.S. patents disclosed during the standard-setting process. Our main results show that the age distribution of SSO patent citations is shifted toward later years (relative to an average patent) and that citations increase substantially following standardization. These results suggest that SSOs identify promising technologies and influence their subsequent adoption.

## 9. Natural Selection in Financial Markets: Does It Work?
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 11 Sep 2008
### Abstract:
Can investors with incorrect beliefs survive in financial markets and have a significant impact on asset prices? My paper addresses this issue by analyzing a dynamic general equilibrium model where some investors have rational expectations, whereas others have incorrect beliefs concerning the mean growth rate of the economy. The main result is that an investor can survive if and only if he has the lowest survival index, which is a function of his belief accuracy, patience parameter, and relative risk aversion coefficient. If preferences are held constant across all investors, then those with incorrect beliefs cannot survive in the limit, although calibrations reveal that the selection process is excessively slow. However, if preferences vary across investors, even slightly, it becomes possible for an irrational investor to dominate the market even if his beliefs persistently and substantially deviate from the truth.

## 10. Learning, Forgetting, and Sales
### Author(s):

### Abstract:
Sellers of almost any product or service rarely keep their prices constant through time and frequently offer price discounts or sales. This paper investigates an explanation of sales as a way for uninformed consumers to be willing to experience the product, and learn about its fit, and where informed consumers may forget about (or change) their preferences. We investigate the role of the rate of consumer forgetting on the timing between sales, and of the rate of consumer learning and menu costs on the length of a sale. The rate of consumer forgetting can be linked to the length of purchase cycle and the level of consumer involvement. We show that the discount frequency and the discount depth are increasing in the rate of consumer forgetting, and that the discount frequency is increasing in the learning rate. The duration of a sale is increasing in the rate of consumer forgetting and the rate of consumer learning.
