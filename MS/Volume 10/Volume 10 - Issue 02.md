## 1. Possibilities for Application of Operational Research to Problems of Development
### Author(s):
- J. Tinbergen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
The organizers of this meeting have asked me to summarize the discussions of the last three days and to draw some conclusions. These will have to be provisional and personal conclusions only, formulated in all modesty, since I am not an expert in several of the more sophisticated methods discussed here.

## 2. Some Observations on Adaptive Forecasting
### Author(s):
- H. Theil
- S. Wage
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
The procedure of “adaptive” or “exponential” forecasting is based on weighted averages of two sources of evidence; one is the latest evidence (the most recent observation), the other the value computed one period before. As such, it is an easy, quick and cheap method; very little information is needed for a forecast; also, the most recent information is used.

## 3. On the Optimality of Adaptive Forecasting
### Author(s):
- M. Nerlove
- S. Wage
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
The general procedure followed in the present paper is to show that, although the series generated by the Theil-Wage model [Theil, H., S. Wage. 1964. Some observations on adaptive forecasting. Management Sci.10.] is nonstationary, there exists a simple transform of the series, in this case the second difference, which is stationary. This observation permits the Wiener-Hopf theory for stationary series to be applied to the transformed series. It is then shown that the results obtained by Theil and Wage are simply related to the optimal constant-parameter, linear predictors of the transformed series and thus that the adaptive forecasts are optimal in a rather wide sense. We believe, therefore, that the results of this paper illustrate a general approach to the prediction of non-stationary time series, and these are, after all, the type mainly encountered in economic or management problems. Thus the paper may have a somewhat wider significance than its title or primary purpose might suggest.

## 4. A Heuristic Approach to Solving Travelling Salesman Problems
### Author(s):
- Robert L. Karg
- Gerald L. Thompson
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
A code for solving travelling salesman problem employing heuristic ideas is described. Acyclic permutations of the cities are constructed by first choosing two cities at random for a permutation of length two, putting the remaining cities in a random list and then inserting cities from the list in the partially constructed permutations so that they add least to the length of the partial tour. A second heuristic idea used in the code is that of breaking up the problem into convex, or almost convex sub-problems and employing the above-mentioned heuristic on these subproblems. Numerical experience with the code is described as well as weaknesses and strengths of the method.

## 5. Estimation, Control and Verification Procedures for a Reliability Model Based on Variables Data
### Author(s):
- Sylvain Ehrenfeld
- Henry DeCicco
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
A technique is discussed for framing a reliability model in terms of variables data rather than attribute data. A particular model is developed in terms of a Gamma process; it is believed that such a model may prove applicable to items undergoing long term storage, especially where continuous observations are not feasible. Estimates of the parameters of the model, along with a discussion of prodcedures for control and verification are included.

## 6. The Sizes of Simulation Samples Required to Compute Certain Inventory Characteristics with Stated Precision and Confidence
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
This study presents calculations of sample sizes, measured in number of simulated time periods, required to estimate certain parameters of selected inventory models with specified precision and confidence. In particular, the inventory models used include the classical zero procurement lead-time case, plus selected non-zero procurement lead-time cases having 2-, 5-, and 10-period lead-times. The parameters estimated are the mean number of shortages and of overages per time period, an overage being the amount of stock on hand at the end of the period, with negative amounts (or shortages) equated to zero.

## 7. On a Basic Class of Multi-Item Inventory Problems
### Author(s):
- Joseph L. Balintfy
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
The paper evaluates and compares classes of multi-item inventory problems, where joint order of several items may save a part of the setup cost. A cost ratio and simple decision rule are determined for joint versus individual orders in specified cases. The comparisons call for the necessity of a new policy for reorder point-triggered random output multi-item systems. This policy, the “random joint order policy,” operates through the determination of a reorder range within which several items can be ordered. The existence of an optimum reorder range is proved, and a computational technique is demonstrated with the help of a machine-interference type queueing model. Under favorable conditions the results exhibited on the diagram of optimum reorder ranges are generally applicable. The random joint order policy model is especially suitable for computer controlled inventory systems.

## 8. Queuing when Jobs Require Several Services which Need Not be Sequenced
### Author(s):
- Richard V. Evans
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
Several queuing models are considered in which a job requires a number of different services. The services are performed in any sequence, possibly simultaneously, by a number of servers. Steady state probabilities are found for two service jobs processed by two server systems. In the first system, the two servers work on the same job if they are working. In the second system, the servers may work on different jobs. If server one is working on job k, server two may be working on job k − 1, k, or k + 1 but not on k − 2 or k + 2. In these systems, the servers are specialists. In the third system, the servers may perform either of the two required services. If one has bogged down, the other server does both parts of each job.

## 9. Preventive Maintenance Scheduling by Mathematical Programming
### Author(s):
- Harvey M. Wagner
- Richard J. Giglio
- R. George Glaser
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
This paper explores methods for scheduling preventive maintenance by means of mathematical programming. Five integer linear programming models are posed, each based on a different optimality criterion dealing with manpower smoothing. By means of two hypothetical examples the models are tested for their computational properties. In addition to describing the experimental results of applying integer linear programming techniques to this class of problems, the paper also illustrates how effectively rounded linear programming solutions can be used as approximations to optimal solutions.

## 10. A Method for Allocating Funds to Investment Projects when Returns are Subject to Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- Joel Cord
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
A method is developed for optimally selecting capital investments with uncertain returns, under conditions of limited funds and a constraint on the maximum average variance allowed in the final investment package. The concepts involved in the analysis are somewhat related to Markowitz's work on the portfolio problem. Dynamic programming is used to compute solutions.

## 11. Allocation of Screening Inspection Effort—A Dynamic-Programming Approach
### Author(s):
- Glenn F. Lindsay
- Albert B. Bishop
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
A general screening inspection program is developed in which inspection levels and the locations of inspection points are treated as variables. It is shown that the function representing the total of inspection and scrap costs will be minimized by an extreme-point solution, thus the minimum-cost inspection program will lie in a relatively restricted subset of all possible allocations. Application of a computational procedure based on dynamic-programming allows the minimum-cost program to be readily determined for instances in which the requirement for inspection is the maintenance of a specified quality level or when a linear cost may be associated with outgoing defective material.

## 12. Nonlinear Programming Problems with Stochastic Objective Functions
### Author(s):
- O. L. Mangasarian
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
In many optimization problems the objective function may depend on a random set of coefficients that have some known distribution. For example, a profit function may depend on certain market conditions which can at best be estimated by a set of random variables with some given distribution. An important question to be answered in such problems is: What is the expected value of the maximum profit? On the answer to this question may hinge certain very important decisions that an organization may have to make. It may also provide good estimates of future profits. While the problem of determining the expected value of the maximum may be very difficult at times, a number of related problems, some quite important in their own right, may be considerably easier to solve and also may provide bounds for the expected value of the maximum. In this work, one upper and three lower bounds are given in terms of the solutions of related problems. In addition a convexity property for a class of parametric nonlinear programming problems is obtained. This property is also used in deriving some of the bounds.

## 13. The Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique for Nonlinear Programing, a Primal-Dual Method
### Author(s):
- Anthony V. Fiacco
- Garth P. McCormick
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
This article is based on an idea proposed by C. W. Carroll for transforming a mathematical programming problem into a sequence of unconstrained minimization problems. It describes the theoretical validation of Carroll's proposal for the convex programming problem. A number of important new results are derived that were not originally envisaged: The method generates primal-feasible and dual-feasible points, the primal objective is monotonically decreased, and a subproblem of the original programming problem is solved with each unconstrained minimization. Briefly surveyed is computational experience with a newly developed algorithm that makes the technique competitive with known methodology. (A subsequent article describing the computational algorithm is in preparation.)

## 14. Systems Theory and Management
### Author(s):
- Richard A. Johnson
- Fremont E. Kast
- James E. Rosenzweig
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
Ludwig von Bertalanffy, in 1951, and Kenneth Boulding, in 1956, wrote articles which have provided a modern foundation for general systems theory [Bertalanffy, L. von. 1951. General system theory: A new approach to unity of science. Human Biol. (December) 303–361; Boulding, K. 1956. General systems theory: The skeleton of science. Management Sci. (April) 197–208.]. We build on that foundation in applying general systems theory to management.

## 15. Effect of Organization Size on Validity of Intelligence Score as a Predictor of Executive Success
### Author(s):
- Albert Porter
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1964
### Abstract:
A population of 428 pre-1944 male Stanford Graduate School of Business MBAs was analyzed for association between executive success criteria and pre-MBA-award intelligence score on either the Thorndike Examination for High School Graduates or the Ohio State University Psychological Test, controlling for size of employing organization (large N = 99, medium N = 221, and tiny N = 108). The only significant validity coefficient was −0.30 (1% level) with the criterion “job interest.” The null hypothesis was rejected for that coefficient, but a warning is given against generalizing or inferring practical implications from this or any similar study at today's primitive stage of executive success prediction research. Management philosophy is undergoing a profound transition from folklore to science. Research is needed to test the validity of existing folklore practices and to test the new hypotheses of management-science scholars. Traditional intelligence tests such as the Thorndike or Ohio have not adequately shouldered the burden of proof to justify their use in executive selection, whatever the organization size.
