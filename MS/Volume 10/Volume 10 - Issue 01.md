## 2. The Power of a Coalition
### Author(s):
- Michael Maschler
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
If certain information is given about the “psychology” of the players who participate in an n-person cooperative game, concerning their bargaining abilities, their moral codes, their roles in the various coalitions and their a priori expectations, then it is possible to define a measure for the power of each coalition which, perhaps, is a better description of the game than the usual characteristic function.

## 3. The Acquisition of Experience in a Complex Management Game
### Author(s):
- William R. Dill
- Neil Doppelt
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
This study was undertaken to evaluate a complex management simulation exercise as an environment for learning. The exercise was the Carnegie Tech Management Game; the players were students in a graduate management program who played the game. Players reported learning many kinds of things from their experience, but learning derived more from interpersonal interactions with other players and with outside groups like boards of directors than from interaction with the game model itself. Players may learn more about recognizing problems for future attention than about solutions of problems that can be applied in new situations. The kinds and amounts of learning vary with the length of game play, with team success or failure, and with individual job assignment on the team. They do not vary with measures of status on the team.

## 4. Some Tactical Problems in Digital Simulation
### Author(s):
- R. W. Conway
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the manner in which an investigation by simulated experimentation is conducted, after the model has been formulated and the computer program completed. It considers the problem of estimating the precision of the results obtained, and methods of improving the precision of results. Alternative procedures are discussed and recommendations are given.

## 5. Technical Characteristics of Distribution Simulators
### Author(s):
- Martin L. Gerson
- Richard B. Maffei
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
The technical characteristics of a procedure to simulate a national distribution system are discussed and compared to linear programming techniques often used in such analyses. The manner in which the cost-generating elements of the system were structured for simulation and the procedure for assigning customers to warehouses are both examined in detail.

## 6. Opportunistic Replacement of a Single Part in the Presence of Several Monitored Parts
### Author(s):
- Roy Radner
- Dale W. Jorgenson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
In a system with several stochastically failing parts and economies of scale in their maintenance, it may be advantageous to follow an “opportunistic” policy for maintenance. In opportunistic policies the action to be taken on a given part at a given time depends on the state of the other parts of the system.

## 7. Operating Characteristics of Opportunistic Replacement and Inspection Policies
### Author(s):
- J. J. McCall
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
This paper calculates some of the operating characteristics of opportunistic replacement and inspection policies. An operating characteristic of a particular policy is a function defined on the stochastic process induced when the policy is implemented. An opportunistic replacement policy makes the replacement of a single uninspected part conditional on the state (good or failed) of one or more continuously inspected (monitored) parts. An opportunistic inspection policy makes the inspection of a non-monitored part conditional on the state (good or failed) of a monitored part. Some of the operating characteristics of these policies examined in this paper are: the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the uninspected part and one of the monitored parts; the expected rate of planned replacement of the uninspected part; the probability of at least m failures of a monitored part in the interval [0, t]; the expected rate of opportunistic inspection—inspection of the non-monitored part which is triggered by a failure of the monitored part; and the expected rate of planned inspection of the non-monitored part. These operating characteristics are precisely the information needed to establish a suitable supply policy. They should also be helpful to the maintenance manager in his efforts to predict the relative frequencies of the various maintenance actions. As an example the opportunistic replacement policy is applied to the rocket engines of a hypothetical ballistic missile. Several operating characteristics are then computed and the sensitivity of these operating characteristics to changes in the rocket engine failure rate is exhibited. This illustrative analysis indicates that both the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the rocket engines and re-entry vehicle and the expected rate of replacement of the rocket engines due to mandatory replacement are highly sensitive to changes in the rocket engine failure rate. On the other hand, the expected rate of opportunistic (joint) replacement of the rocket engines and the guidance and control system is relatively unaffected by changes in the engine failure rate.

## 8. A Probabilistic Production and Inventory Problem
### Author(s):
- F. d'Epenoux
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
R. Howard (R. Howard.1960. Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.) and A. Manne (A. Manne. 1960. Linear programming and sequential decisions. Management Science, April.) have suggested two methods for optimizing average costs per unit time by means of a sequential decision rule. This rule gives order quantities as a function of initial stock levels, and is based upon the assumption of a Markov process which is both homogenous and discrete. The formulation does not include any restrictive hypothesis on the structure of costs.

## 9. An Inventory Problem with Discrete Time Review and Replenishment by Batches of Fixed Size
### Author(s):
- M. Resh
- P. Naor
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
An inventory system under periodic review is considered. If at the time of review the stock has fallen below a given level, L, a fixed quantity, Q, is ordered; otherwise no action is taken. It is assumed that delivery time is negligible. Two costs are considered to be of importance: one proportional to the average overage, the second proportional to the average shortage.

## 10. Economic Models for Industrial Waiting Line Problems
### Author(s):
- Frederick S. Hillier
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
Studies of industrial waiting line problems typically involve determining the proper balance between the amount of service and the amount of waiting for that service. This paper presents some basic results for the case where the study is to be based upon fundamental cost considerations and the assumption of an infinite calling population. Included are a number of economic models and accompanying procedures for determining the level of service which minimizes the total of the expected cost of service and the expected cost of waiting for that service.

## 11. Jobshop-Like Queueing Systems
### Author(s):
- James R. Jackson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
The equilibrium joint probability distribution of queue lengths is obtained for a broad class of jobshop-like “networks of waiting lines,” where the mean arrival rate of customers depends almost arbitrarily upon the number already present, and the mean service rate at each service center depends almost arbitrarily upon the queue length there. This extension of the author's earlier work is motivated by the observation that real production systems are usually subject to influences which make for increased stability by tending, as the amount of work-in-process grows, to reduce the rate at which new work is injected or to increase the rate at which processing takes place.

## 12. On Some Theorems of Stochastic Linear Programming with Applications
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
A linear programming problem is said to be stochastic if one or more of the coefficients in the objective function or the system of constraints or resource availabilities is known only by its probability distribution. Various approaches are available in this case, which may be classified into three broad types: ‘chance constrained programming’, ‘two-stage programming under uncertainty’ and ‘stochastic linear programming’. For problems of ‘stochastic linear programming’ a distinction is usually made between two related approaches to stochastic programming, the passive and the active approach respectively. In the passive approach to stochastic linear programming the statistical distribution of the optimum value of the objective function is estimated either exactly or approximately by numerical methods and optimum decision rules are based on the different characteristics of the estimated distribution. In the active approach, a new set of decision variables are introduced which indicate the proportions of different resources to be allocated to the various activities. One effect of introducing this set of new decision variables in the active approach is the truncation of the statistical distribution of optimal value of the objective function of the passive approach. In this aspect the active approach is useful in suggesting criteria for changing from one optimum decision rule to another, as the probability distribution of the objective function is specified less and less incompletely for different choices of the set of new decision variables. This paper investigates some mathematical relations between the active and passive approach and derives some inequalities for the case when the elements of the coefficient matrix of the inequalities are random variables. Since an ’approximate solution’ of a stochastic linear programming problem is defined usually by replacing each random element by its expected value and then solving the resulting non-stochastic program, some conditions have been derived under which the expected value of the objective function for the optimal solution will exceed the optimal value of the objective function for ’the approximate solution’. Based on the properties of the distribution of extreme values and other order statistics, some approximate bounds have also been specified for the passive approach, which can easily be extended to the active approach.

## 13. Solution of Nonlinear Programming Problems by Partitioning
### Author(s):
- J. B. Rosen
- J. C. Ornea
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
An important class of mathematical programming problems is the scheduling of manufacturing and transportation systems. In many cases, the independent variables which describe the manufacturing system are interrelated in a highly nonlinear manner. The majority of the system variables are normally required to represent transportation and allocation. These variables appear linearly and must satisfy a system of equalities which is very large if considered as a single matrix.

## 14. An Expected Gain-Confidence Limit Criterion for Portfolio Selection
### Author(s):
- William J. Baumol
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1963
### Abstract:
A new efficiency criterion is proposed for the Markowitz portfolio selection approach. It is shown that the use of standard deviation as a measure of risk in the original Markowitz analysis and elsewhere in economic theory is sometimes unreasonable. An Investment with a relatively high standard deviation (σ) will be relatively safe if its expected value (E) is sufficiently high. For the net result may be a high expected floor, E − Kσ, beneath the future value of the investment (where K is some constant). The revised efficient set is shown to eliminate paradoxical cases arising from the Markowitz calculation. It also simplifies the task left to the investor. For it yields a smaller efficient set (which is a subset of the Markowitz efficient set) and therefore reduces the range of alternatives from among which the investor must still select his portfolio. The proposed criterion may also be somewhat more easily understood by the nonprofessional.
