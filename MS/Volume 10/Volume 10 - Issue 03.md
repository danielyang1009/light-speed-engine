## 1. Control in Large Organizations
### Author(s):
- Kenneth J. Arrow
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
The problem of control is defined as that of choosing operating rules for members of an organization and enforcement rules for the operating rules so to maximize the organization's objective function. The control problem is sketched for three characteristic types of large organizations: large corporations, governments in their budgetary aspects, and economic systems as a whole. The essential roles of uncertainty and of differential amounts of information in different parts of an organization in the problem of control are brought out. The merits and drawbacks of the price system as a control mechanism are discussed in light of the preceding discussion, with especial reference to the effects of uncertainty.

### Author(s):
- Herbert Holt
- Robert C. Ferber
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
In this paper we endeavor to show how a management scientist maintains his integrity and individuality while changing from a staff position to a consultant position and eventually to a top executive position in a large company. It is a segment of a longitudinal study and is presented in a special format, which makes it possible to present the data at all.

## 3. The Naval Aviation Supply Office Inventory Retrieval System—A Case Study in File Automation
### Author(s):
- Barry Zimmerman
- David Lefkovitz
- Noah S. Prywes
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This article describes the case history of the pilot mechanization of files at the Naval Aviation Supply Office. The system described retrieves information on a real-time basis from a large file of technical and inventory data stored on magnetic disk memory. A feature of the system is the use of the Multi-List technique which stores an addressing index in the form of trees that provide access to the main file. The main file may be accessed by many different types of descriptors. Input to the file is via magnetic tape, console inquiry, or remote interrogation station. File and tree construction, the use of linkages between items to form lists, and the executive routine are described.

## 4. The Dynamic Inventory Problem with Unknown Demand Distribution
### Author(s):
- Donald L. Iglehart
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
In this paper we consider the dynamic inventory problem in which the demand distribution possesses a density belonging to either the exponential or range family of densities and having an unknown parameter. An a priori density is chosen for the unknown parameter. Using a Bayesian estimation scheme, inequalities are obtained for the optimal purchase policies as the amount of demand information varies. In addition, asymptotic expansions for the optimal policies are found as the number of observations of the demand becomes large. This paper extends the results of Scarf, [8].

## 5. Production Planning with Convex Costs: A Parametric Study
### Author(s):
- Arthur F. Veinott, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of choosing the amounts of a single product to produce in each of a finite number of time periods so as to minimize the (convex) production and (convex) inventory carrying costs over the periods while satisfying known requirements. The effect of changes in the various parameters, viz., the requirements and the production and inventory capacity limits, upon the optimal production levels is studied. The results obtained are exploited to provide simple and intuitive computational procedures for finding optimal production schedules for a range of parameter values.

## 8. A Comparison of Order Quantities Computed Using the Average Annual Cost and the Discounted Cost
### Author(s):
- G. Hadley
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This note compares the optimal order quantities determined by minimizing the average annual cost and by minimizing the discounted cost over all future time for the simplest imaginable type of inventory model in which the demand rate is assumed to be deterministic and no stockouts are allowed. By specific numerical results it is shown that for all values of the parameters that might reasonably be encountered in an inventory problem there is only a negligible if any difference in the order quantities. It is shown, however, that in extreme cases significant differences may be obtained.

## 9. On a Problem of Production Planning for a Non-Storable Commodity
### Author(s):
- R. M. Zaki
- B. B. Bhattacharyya
- R. L. Anderson
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This paper is concerned with the decision problem faced by a firm which produces a non-storable commodity and has to spend large amounts of capital on a specialized factor that could remain idle part of the time because of fluctuations in production. The optimum decision rule is derived under one resource restriction and an explicit parametric solution has been obtained. The model has then been extended to incorporate more than one resource restriction, for which certain parametric solutions have been obtained.

## 10. The Engineering Change of the Total Requirements Matrix for a Bill of Materials
### Author(s):
- Leon Gleiberman
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
Matrix methods for various “bill of materials” computations have been described in papers by Vazsonyi [Vazsonyi, A. 1954. The use of mathematics in production and inventory control. Management Sci.1 (1, October) 70–85; Vazsonyi, A. 1958. Scientific Programming in Business and Industry. Wiley, 429–452.], Vazsonyi and Larson [Vazsonyi, A., H. T. Larson. 1955. Data-processor requirements in production and inventory control. Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference, 48–61.], and Giffler [Giffler, B. Mathematical solution of production planning and scheduling problems. IBM Technical Report 09.01028.026.]. Wide-spread use of these ideas has been hampered by the large amount of computation that the basic “total-requirements” matrix T involves. In this paper, a new and efficient iterative method for engineering changes of T is discussed, and this method is applied to the original generation of T, and to the inversion of certain matrices.

## 11. An Algebra for the Analysis of Generalized Activity Networks
### Author(s):
- Salah E. Elmaghraby
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This paper generalizes the approach of activity networks, exemplified by PERT and CPM, to networks in which activites and events occur probabilistically and contain logical relationships of a more complicated nature. For example, from a specific event some activities are undertaken with certainty while others probabilistically. It presents an algebra of analysis taking the decision rules or logical structure of the system as given. The approach is applicable to the analysis of practical situations such as contract bidding, flow in shops, etc.

## 12. The Maximization of a Quadratic Function of Variables Subject to Linear Inequalities
### Author(s):
- Wilfred Candler
- Robert J. Townsley
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
A simplex-type method for finding a local maximum of
subject to
and
is proposed. At a local maximum, the objective function (1), can be expressed, in terms of the non-basic variables λ0, as
and the vector of partial derivatives of (13), with respect to the non-basic variables may be written,
This allows calculation of the maximum values of the non-basic variables, increased one at a time, consistent with ∇Z ≧ 0. A “cutting plane” a**λ′ ≧ 1 is then defined which excludes the local optimum, and many lower values (but no higher values) of (1).

## 13. The Dynamic Effects of Planning Horizons on the Selection of Optimal Product Strategies
### Author(s):
- Marvin G. DeVries
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
The selection of appropriate product strategies by firms must account for the expected long-run returns from the market a firm contemplates entering, relative to the expected long-run returns from the market it is currently serving. These expected returns must also reflect the capabilities a firm has to implement this strategy and the resulting competitive situations it will face. The mathematical techniques of Markov processes and dynamic programming are used in this paper to develop an analytic framework which will select optimal product strategies for a firm that are consistent with its capabilities, that will meet its competitive situations, and that will maximize expected returns in the long run. This model is applied to a selected set of Michigan machine tool firms. The results indicate the general importance of total firm capabilities and the greater importance of management capability over the supporting capabilities in the selection of optimal product strategies.

## 14. Business Gaming for Organizational Research
### Author(s):
- Bernard M. Bass
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
A non-computer business game is described which can be used to test hypotheses about the effects of different organizational structures on material and social psychological outcomes. The competitive game requires firms of about 15 men each to compete in a common market. But, only one-third of the organization is allowed to meet face-to-face. Tangible products are produced out of IBM cards by cutting, assembling and fastening processes. Markets are based on managerial decisions of the competing firms. In the first three competitions, it was observed that the simpler organizational structure served more adequately than the more complex hierarchy that was designed for the problem. Whether or not a radically different structure, without a hierarchy, worked well, depended upon the extent the real-life managers operating the organization had been indoctrinated sufficiently into the rationale behind the innovation and had accepted it as desirable. Subsequent experiments are in progress using the game.

## 15. Management Science and Marketing Science
### Author(s):
- Martin Kenneth Starr
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This paper considers the contributions which management science has made toward the development of a science of marketing. It is convenient to appraise the present situation in decision theory terms. Insight and understanding are fostered by differentiating the difficulties encountered by management science in marketing from those in production. The two-culture problem, and its inhibiting effect upon advancements in marketing science, is discussed. The concluding section of the paper suggests some steps that might be rewarding if implemented in the future.

## 16. Optimum No-Risk Strategy for Win-Place Pari-Mutuel Betting
### Author(s):
- Kenneth E. Willis
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
The problem of finding an optimum, no-risk strategy for placing simultaneous win and place pari-mutuel bets is formulated in terms of a linear programming problem. For a basic feasible solution (i.e., a profitable schedule of bets) to exist, it is necessary for the win and place pools to weight the contestants differently. If the stake holder removes a fraction of the pool, then a solution is not guaranteed, but will exist if this difference in win-place weighting is sufficient. A simple example is presented.

## 17. A Primal Method for the Assignment and Transportation Problems
### Author(s):
- M. L. Balinski
- R. E. Gomory
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1964
### Abstract:
This paper describes a simple calculation for the assignment and transportation problems which is “dual to” the well-known Hungarian Method. While the Hungarian is a dual method, this method is primal and so gives a feasible assignment at each stage of the calculation. Bounds on the number of steps required for the assignment and transportation problems are given. They are the same as the best bounds known for the Hungarian Method.

### Abstract:
I have detected the following minor errors in my article, “Operating Characteristics of Opportunistic Replacement and Inspection Policies," Management Science, Vol. 10, No. 1 (October 1963), pp. 85–98, that might possibly cause some confusion. The first five “t's” appearing in the Preliminaries (p. 87), the first five “t's” in the Preliminaries (p. 88) and the first five “t's” in the Preliminaries (p. 90) should all be “X's”.
