## 1. Computational Algorithm for the Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique for Nonlinear Programming
### Author(s):
- Anthony V. Fiacco
- Garth P. McCormick
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
In a previous article [Fiacco, A. V., G. P. McCormick. 1964. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique for nonlinear programming, a primal-dual method. Management Sci.10(2) 360–366.] the authors gave the theoretical validation of the sequential unconstrained minimization technique for solving the convex programming problem. The technique is based on an idea proposed by C. W. Carroll [Carroll, C. W. 1961. The created response surface technique for optimizing nonlinear restrained systems. Oper. Res.9(2) 169–184; Carroll, C. W. 1959. An operations research approach to the economic optimization of a Kraft Pulping Process. Doctoral dissertation, The Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisc.]. The method has been implemented via an algorithm based on a second-order gradient technique that has proved extremely efficient on a considerable number of test problems of varying complexity. This paper explores the computational aspects of the method. Included are discussions of parameter selection, convergence criteria, and methods of minimizing an unconstrained function. It is shown that the problem variables, on the trajectory of minima of the sequence of unconstrained functions, can be developed as functions of a single parameter. This provides the theoretical basis for an extrapolation technique that significantly accelerates convergence in actual computations. The detailed computer solution of a small example is given to illustrate the typical convergence characteristics of the method. The speed and accuracy of the computational procedure are believed to be competitive with other known techniques for solving the convex programming problem.

## 3. A Theory of Market Behavior After Innovation
### Author(s):
- George H. Haines, Jr.
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
This paper is a report of a study of innovation of consumer nondurable products. A simple hypothesis about consumer behavior in short run, non-equilibrium situations is presented. Following classical economic methodology, the behavior of individuals is then aggregated. This aggregate equation form is tested and shown to be not rejected by the data. The effect of marketing actions of the firm upon consumer behavior is also explored.

## 4. Performance Evaluation in Marketing Systems
### Author(s):
- William R. King
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
The use of multiple performance criteria which account for both the static and dynamic aspects of marketing systems is proposed as a necessary step toward scientific marketing analysis. Currently, over-all evaluations using multiple performance measures are difficult to make and even more difficult to interpret meaningfully. Fisher's technique of discriminant functions is utilized to estimate the mathematical relationship between the relevant marketing performance measures which best “matches” subjective classifications agreed upon by a number of business executives. An application of the technique involving the evaluation of a consumer product's performance in various market areas is discussed. The problems of bias and multicollinearity, their relationship to the conceptual approaches, and their effect on the use of the performance measure are also discussed using the particular problems encountered in the application to illustrate the various points.

## 5. An Analysis of Vertical Market Structures
### Author(s):
- Helmy H. Baligh
- Leon E. Richartz
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
Models of vertical market structures are developed and solved for equilibrium numbers and levels of middlemen. The models investigate the behavior of contact and communication costs, and middlemen's profits in the system, under various market imperfections. When market imperfections are assumed away, the model gives an unrealistically large equilibrium number of middlemen and levels of middlemen. The removal of some assumptions by considering a) rebates given by middlemen in order to gain cooperation, b) segmented markets, c) costs of information transmittal, d) conditions of minimum returns on investment, and e) strategy formulation render the model more realistic.

## 6. Optimal Policies for the Inventory Problem with Negotiable Leadtime
### Author(s):
- Yoichiro Fukuda
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
In this paper we study the dynamic inventory problem in which amounts of stock ordered at unit prices ck and ck+1 (ck > ck+1) are delivered, respectively, k and k + 1 periods later. It is demonstrated that under suitable cost conditions, the optimal policies are similar to those of the dynamic inventory problem with a delivery lag of k + 1 periods, except for an additional constant stock level up to which it is desired to order at unit price cK. If we assume that ordering decisions are made in every other period, it is demonstrated that analogous results are obtainable for the case in which amounts of stock ordered at unit prices ck, ck+1, and ck+2 (ck > ck+1 > ck+2) are delivered, respectively, k, k + 1, and k + 2 periods later.

## 7. A Test of a Statistical Method for Computing Selected Inventory Model Characteristics by Simulation
### Author(s):
- Murray A. Geisler
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
This article is a companion piece to M. A. Geisler, The Sizes of Simulation Samples Required to Compute Certain Inventory Characteristics with Stated Precision and Confidence, MANAGEMENT SCIENCE, January, 1964. Special statistical methods were used in that article to compute the sample sizes for specified inventory models. In this article, the methods were tested by applying them to particular inventory cases, and determining how well the actual precision and confidence obtained in the estimates agreed with expectation.

## 8. A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Embedded Markov Chains when the Planning Horizon is at Infinity
### Author(s):
- John S. de Cani
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
This paper presents an algorithm for the solution of dynamic programming problems requiring the determination of optimal policies for the control of a special class of stochastic processes when the time horizon of the planning period is at infinity. These processes can be mathematically described as discrete time parameter Markov chains with a finite number of states which have been “embedded” in continuous time in the sense that the time between transitions is a random variable whose probability distribution depends only on the states between which the transition takes place. Such processes are called Markov-renewal processes. The Markov processes considered by R. A. Howard in [1] are really two special cases of this somewhat wider class of stochastic processes. In these two special cases, the algorithm of this paper is identical with Howard's. In fact, with only slight modification, Howard's algorithm can be extended to this wider class of stochastic processes.

## 9. Resource Allocation in a PERT Network Under Continuous Activity Time-Cost Functions
### Author(s):
- E. B. Berman
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
This paper describes a conceptual model which allocates resources in a PERT network, the activities of which are subject to continuous concave-upward time-cost functions, in such a way as to achieve a minimum cost solution for a given completion date for the program described by the network. A parametric solution for the minimum cost solution at various total program times is also briefly described. The effect of uncertainty in the time of completion of an activity has also been investigated in a highly simplified model; and a tentative conclusion is presented that such uncertainty tends to divert resources toward the earlier part of the program, as compared to the solution under certainty.

## 10. Optimal Policies for a Class of Search and Evaluation Problems
### Author(s):
- James B. MacQueen
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
A person searches through a population of possible actions, looking for one with high value. He discovers these actions one after another, paying a certain cost each time. On his first encounter with a possible action, the person obtains some preliminary information about its actual value, and at this point he can take the action, he can continue looking, or, at a certain cost, he can perform a test and obtain some more information about its actual value. If he decides to test, then having obtained the additional information he can again either take the action or continue looking. The problem is to conduct this process in such a manner as to maximize expected net value, that is, the expected value of the action finally taken minus the expected total cost of searching and testing.

## 11. Development and Application of a Model for Suppression of Forest Fires
### Author(s):
- George M. Parks
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
A deterministic model is suggested to describe the spread of free-burning wildland fires and the effect of various types of suppression activity thereon. The costs caused by fire are described and optimal levels of suppression forces are derived with the objective of minimizing the total costs of suppression plus fire damage. Costs incurred under optimal manning policies as given by the model are compared with the historical costs incurred on actual forest fires under present manning plans. Results indicate that significant dollar savings can be achieved in total fire caused costs by considerably increasing the size of fire suppression organizations.

## 12. A Heuristic Procedure for Parallel Sequencing with Choice of Machines
### Author(s):
- Eugene S. Schwartz
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
An algorithm is described for parallel sequencing on two machines of a set of operations with partial ordering constraints. Some assignments are fixed and some are flexible allowing a choice of machines; operation times for the flexible assignments are assumed to be equal. The algorithm establishes a parallel sequence that seeks to minimize the elapsed time required for both machines to complete processing without testing the set of possible permutations on operations. Assignment decision rules are formulated to balance the parallel sequences considering accumulated time and remaining future commitments on each machine. Experimental results comparing programmed solutions with lower bounds of running time are given.

## 13. Optimum Plant Design for Seasonal Production
### Author(s):
- J. R. Coleman, Jr.
- S. Smidt
- R. York
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
A systematic optimization procedure is developed for the design of a plant which is subject to uncertain, seasonal production. Based on a generalized seasonal production model, the present value of the cash flows associated with production by means of a combination of alternates is expressed in terms of the unknown capacities. On the basis of the derived solution, a systematic procedure is presented which yields optimum designs without reference to the involved mathematics. Finally, the more important assumptions are removed and suggestions are given with respect to the modifications that are required in order to extend the method to more complex problems.

- H. Weingarten
- P. W. Zehna
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1964
### Abstract:
A model is defined wherein corrective action may be accounted for in improving the estimation of reliability over the usual nominal success ratio. Probabilities for correcting any one of K failure modes which may arise are assumed known and a multinomial sampling procedure is discussed. Mean reliability is defined as a function of the unknown probabilities attached to the failure modes and the problem of estimating this parameter is posed.
