## 1. Eliciting Public Values for Complex Policy Decisions

### Published:

### Abstract:
Several approaches exist to illuminate and clarify public values relevant for making public policy decisions. These include surveys, indirect and direct value elicitation, focus groups and public involvement. This paper describes a new approach, called the public value forum, which combines elements of focus groups and direct multiattribute value elicitation techniques. Two public value forums were conducted with selected members of the West German public to elicit values relevant for setting long term energy policies. The purposes of conducting the value forums were to examine the feasibility of eliciting values from laypeople and combining them with factual assessments of experts, to determine the extent to which values elicited formally conflict with values elicited informally, and to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the public value forum. The results indicate that the public value forum is feasible, that the participants felt comfortable with the procedure and that they were eager to resolve inconsistencies between their intuitive judgments and the multiattribute models. There was substantial conflict between the formally and informally elicited values. However, the participants were able to resolve those conflicts in the course of the value forum, tending towards more moderate alternatives in the process. The public value forum provided useful information for the policy process and education for the participants. However, because it is expensive and time consuming, its main application may involve small samples of opinion leaders and stakeholder representatives, rather than large representative samples of the general public.

## 2. Weekly Patterns in Japanese Stock Returns
### Author(s):
- Kiyoshi Kato
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
This study investigates the day of the week effect in the Japanese stock returns. Low Tuesday and high Wednesday returns are observed. Most of the positive returns arise during the nontrading period. The Monday effect is also observed in the week whose previous week is closed by Friday trading. Low Tuesday returns appear to be related to low Monday returns in the U.S. The weekly pattern is more pronounced for the returns of smaller firms. A reverse size effect is observed during the trading period.

## 3. Combining Forecasts: Operational Adjustments to Theoretically Optimal Rules
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
Clemen and Winkler (1985) have described the theoretical effectiveness of Winkler's (1981) formula for optimally combining forecasts. The optimality of Winkler's formula is, however, contingent on actually knowing the forecasters' statistical properties, i.e., the variances and covariances of their forecasts. In realistic applications, of course, these properties have to be estimated, usually from a set of prior forecasts. In this case we show how the operationally optimal combining strategy differs from Winkler's theoretically optimal formula. Specifically, we provide figures indicating the operationally optimal strategy for combining two forecasts. We then propose a heuristic to choose the best set of parameter estimates in combining any number of forecasters and demonstrate its effectiveness via simulation.

## 4. The Innovation Diffusion Process in a Heterogeneous Population: A Micromodeling Approach
### Author(s):
- Rabik Ar Chatterjee
- Jehoshua Eliashberg
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
A model of the innovation diffusion process is developed using a micromodeling approach that explicitly considers the determinants of adoption at the individual level in a decision analytic framework, and incorporates heterogeneity in the population with respect to initial perceptions, preference characteristics, and responsiveness to information. The micromodelling approach provides a behavioral basis for explaining adoption at the disaggregate level and the consequent pattern of diffusion at the aggregate level. The analytical implications of the model are compared and contrasted with the traditional, aggregate-level, diffusion models. An advantage of our approach is its micro-theory driven flexibility in accommodating various patterns of diffusion. Examples are provided of conditions under which the model yields diffusion patterns identical to those of some well-known aggregate models. A pilot study is reported, outlining procedures for data collection and estimation of the individual-level parameters, and providing a preliminary test of the predictive performance of the model. Measurement of the individual parameters prior to product launch enables potential applications of the model for segmentation of the target population in terms of their expected adoption times.

## 5. Arranging Queues in Series: A Simulation Experiment
### Author(s):
- S. Suresh
- W. Whitt
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
For given external arrival process and given service-time distributions, the object is to determine the order of infinite-capacity single-server queues in series that minimizes the long-run average sojourn time per customer. We gain additional insight into this queueing design problem, and congestion in non-Markov open queueing networks more generally, by performing simulations for the case of two queues. For this design problem, we conclude that the key issue is variability: The order tends to matter more when the service-time distributions have significantly different variability, and less otherwise. Arranging the queues in order of increasing service-time variability, using the squared coefficient of variation as a partial characterization of variability, seems to be an effective simple design heuristic. Parametric-decomposition approximations seem to provide relatively good quantitative estimates of how much the order matters.

## 6. A Branch-and-Bound Method for the Fixed Charge Transportation Problem
### Author(s):
- Udatta S. Palekar
- Mark H. Karwan
- Stanley Zionts
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a new conditional penalty for the fixed charge transportation problem. This penalty is stronger than both the Driebeek penalties and the Lagrangean penalties of Cabot and Erenguc. Computational testing shows that the use of these penalties leads to significant reductions in enumeration and solution times for difficult problems in the size range tested. We also study the effect of problem parameters on the difficulty of the problem. The ratio of fixed charges to variable costs, the shape of the problem, arc density in the underlying network and fixed charge arc density are shown to have a significant effect on problem difficulty for problems involving up to 40 origins and 40 destinations.

## 7. Linear Optimal Designs and Optimal Contingency Plans
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
In optimal design problems we try to select a subset from the opportunity set for commitment for a period of time. As the external parameters can vary with time, optimal contingency plans must be constructed to cope with the external conditions. We describe the formulation and methods for locating potentially good designs and their corresponding optimal contingency plans using a multiple-criteria and multiple-constraint level (MC2) simplex method to solve the optimal design problems which have been shown to become amenable to the techniques of decision making under uncertainty.

## 8. Shared Storage Policies Based on the Duration Stay of Unit Loads
### Author(s):
- Marc Goetschalckx
- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
This paper addresses duration-of-stay-based shared storage policies for a unit load warehouse. We show that, for single command storage and retrieval, shared storage policies based on duration of stay of individual unit loads have the potential to significantly decrease travel time. An optimal storage policy with respect to travel time and storage space is developed for systems with balanced input and output. Based on the same principles, two heuristic policies are developed for more complex systems. Simulation results are provided which compare travel times for dedicated storage, random storage, turnover-based storage classes, and duration-of-stay-based storage classes.

## 9. Implicit Cost Allocation and Bidding for Contracts
### Author(s):
- Susan I. Cohen
- Martin Loeb
### Published:
- 1 Sep 1990
### Abstract:
The question of how, or even whether, indirect costs should be allocated for pricing decisions has been controversial and unresolved. This paper takes a step toward answering this question by examining the special case of a firm that must incur incremental fixed costs to complete any or all of the several projects for which it is submitting simultaneous bids. An independent private-values bidding model is employed to endogenously determine an optimal cost allocation; we term such a cost allocation implicit. The optimal implicit fixed cost allocation is shown to fully allocate fixed costs ex ante, although the fixed costs may be under, over, or exactly allocated ex post.
