## 2. Remarks on the Analytic Hierarchy Process
### Author(s):
- James S. Dyer
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is flawed as a procedure for ranking alternatives in that the rankings produced by this procedure are arbitrary. This paper provides a brief review of several areas of operational difficulty with the AHP, and then focuses on the arbitrary rankings that occur when the principle of hierarchic composition is assumed. This principle requires that the weights on the higher levels of a hierarchy can be determined independently of the weights on the lower levels. Virtually all of the published examples of the use of the AHP to evaluate alternatives relative to a set of criteria have assumed this principle. The key to correcting this flaw is the synthesis of the AHP with the concepts of multiattribute utility theory.

## 6. The Effects of Brand Loyalty on Competitive Price Promotional Strategies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the role played by brand loyalty in determining optimal price promotional strategies used by firms in a competitive setting. (Loyalty is operationalized as the minimum price differential needed before consumers who prefer one brand switch to another brand.) Our objective is to examine how loyalties toward the competing brands influence whether or not firms would use price promotions in a product category. We also examine how loyalty differences lead to variations in the depth and frequency with which price discounts are offered across brands in the same product category.

## 7. Data Envelopment Analysis on a Relaxed Set of Assumptions
### Author(s):
- Niels Christian Petersen
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
Data Envelopment Analysis is a procedure for evaluation of the relative efficiency of units in a production system. DEA involves construction of composite units as convex combinations of other units' inputs and outputs under various conditions related to returns to scale. The assumption of convexity is inconsistent with increasing returns to scale and not implied by constant or non-increasing returns to scale. An alternative DEA approach which does not invoke the assumption of a convex production possibility set is developed in this paper. It is implemented in two stages. Stage one is concerned with the spanning of isoquants and stage two with an evaluation of the position of an observed input-output combination compared to the isoquants. Both stages involve linear programming techniques solely.

## 8. A New Algorithm for Computing the Maximal Closure of a Graph
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
A closure in a directed graph is a subset of nodes, all of whose successors belong to the subset. If each node has an assigned weight, which may be positive or negative, the maximal closure problem is one of finding a closure with the largest possible sum of node weights. It can be solved by any maximal flow or minimal cut algorithm. We present a new algorithm for this problem which compares favorably to maximal flow and minimal cut procedures on randomly generated classes of problems.

## 9. A Stochastic Sequencing Problem for Style Goods with Forecast Revisions and Hierarchical Structure
### Author(s):
- Hirofumi Matsuo
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
This paper addresses the problem of simultaneously determining a production sequence and production volumes of style goods. Style goods have one selling season per year. During the rest of the year, manufacturers of style goods build up the inventory while continuously reestimating the demand in the final selling season. In this problem, products have a two-stage hierarchy: items and families. The production of a family is assumed to be nonpreemptive. Exploiting the hierarchical structure, we formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic sequencing problem: the stochastic aggregate sequencing problem and the stochastic disaggregation problem. To solve the stochastic aggregate sequencing problem, a simple heuristic solution procedure is developed that accounts for the forecast revisions and provides a lower bound on the optimal value. The heuristic is tested using the disguised data obtained from a consumer electronics company. The computational results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed procedure.

## 10. Economic Lot Scheduling for Multiple Products on Parallel Identical Processors
### Author(s):
- Jose Juan Carreno
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
This paper deals with an identical multiprocessor, multiproduct, lot-size scheduling problem under deterministic conditions. The problem is an extension of the single-processor ELSP problem. The objective is to minimize the average production and inventory costs per unit time subject to constraints of no shortages and no interference among the products. A mathematical formulation for the problem is given. A heuristic procedure, which extends the Common Cycle approach for a single processor, is suggested and computational results are reported. Upper and Lower bounds are developed and used to measure the effectiveness of the procedure.

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
The hypothesis that firms simultaneously determine their research and development, investment, dividend, and new debt policies generally is substantiated in the financial literature. The strategic planning model advocated in this study offers an alternative to the generally accepted goals of maximizing the return on equity or growth in earnings per share.

## 12. Mean-Variance Approaches to Risk-Return Relationships in Strategy: Paradox Lost
### Author(s):
- Timothy W. Ruefli
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
A growing number of articles in the area of strategic management employ a mean-variance approach to risk-return relationships. Some researchers investigating risk-return relationships in this fashion claim to have found negative associations between the levels of return and risk. The analysis reported here demonstrates that the mean-variance approach to return and risk carries with it the consequence that statements about the relationship are inherently unverifiable in the context of the system being examined. This further implies that results obtained by using mean and variance of return are specific to the data and period examined and are not necessarily generalizable. Additionally, since mean and variance are arithmetically linked, augmenting the system with additional equations will not provide the information necessary to establish the validity or generalizability of statements involving the mean-variance relation. The analytic proofs are supplemented by examples drawn from an empirical study of the U.S. airline industry.

## 13. Optimal Centralized Ordering Policies in Multi-Echelon Inventory Systems with Correlated Demands
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
This paper treats a depot-warehouse system in which demand occurs at the warehouse or retail level. This work differs from a number of other studies in that we allow item demands to be correlated both across warehouses and also correlated in time. Our motivation for this generalization arises from our experience with an actual system of this type used by a major national producer and distributor of consumer products. We observed both high correlations between successive monthly demands (around 0.7) and correlations between demands for an item at different locations (also about 0.7) in a given time period. We derive an explicit expression for the optimal safety stock as a function of the level of correlation through time. The analysis requires two assumptions: 1) the allocation assumption and 2) the equal coefficient of variation assumption. (Similar assumptions have been used by other researchers.) Finally, numerical evaluations are included to illustrate the impact of the various magnitudes of correlation.

## 14. NoteNew Confidence Interval Estimators Using Standardized Time Series
### Author(s):
- David Goldsman
- Lee Schruben
### Published:
- 1 Mar 1990
### Abstract:
We develop new asymptotically valid confidence interval estimators (CIE's) for the underlying mean of a stationary simulation process. The new estimators are weighted generalizations of Schruben's standardized time series area CIE. We show that the weighted CIE's have the same asymptotic expected length and variance of the length as the area CIE; but in the small sample environment, the new CIE's exhibit performance characteristics which are different from those of the area CIE.
