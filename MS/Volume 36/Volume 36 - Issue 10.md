## 2. Determinants of Financial Performance: A Meta-Analysis
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
A meta-analysis of results from 320 published studies relates environmental, strategic and organizational factors to financial performance. Some factors (e.g., concentration and growth) have been studied widely and have a relatively consistent positive impact on performance. Other widely-studied factors (e.g., size) have few consistent effects. Many factors (particularly organizational variables) are understudied. We suggest implications for research and management practice.

## 3. Environment, Market Share, and Market Power
### Author(s):
- William Boulding
- Richard Staelin
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
In this paper we develop a process model relating market share to firm profits. In particular, we specify average price and average cost equations as a function of previous year market share position, changes in market share, environmental conditions, and interactions of environmental conditions with the lagged market position and market share change variables. We estimate these equations using PIMS data after controlling for unobservable factors. Our results suggest that firms with high market shares derive no extra market power benefits except if they operate in environments with little buyer power. Instead, environmental factors and changes in market share most strongly influence price and cost. An analysis of the market share associated with maximal firm profits indicates that for the majority of firms in our sample steadily increasing market share does not always associate with increasing profits, giving credence to the proposition that more market share is not always better.

## 4. Strategy, Complexity, and Economic Rent
### Author(s):
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This paper discusses important friction forces that future theories of strategy must incorporate. Some of these are technological and environmental; but the most important onesit is arguedare psychological. The view is developed that strategy, at its core, concerns the development and testing of heuristics for high stake decisions in environments too unstable and complex to be optimized.

## 5. Firm-Level Productivity and Management Influence: A Comparison of U.S. and Japanese Automobile Producers
### Author(s):
- Marvin B. Lieberman

- Mark D. Williams
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This study compares the productivity of six major US and Japanese motor vehicle manufacturersGeneral Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, Nissan and Mazdafrom the early 1950's through 1987. Techniques of productivity measurement, conventionally applied at the level of industries or national economies, are adapted for the analysis of individual firms. Several potential determinants of growth in productivity are evaluated, including economies of scale, adoption of just-in-time manufacturing, and changes in top management.

## 6. Broader Product Line: A Necessity to Achieve Success?
### Author(s):
- Sunder Kekre
- Kannan Srinivasan
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
Strategic product line breadth decisions evoke differential responses from the manufacturing and the marketing areas: manufacturing prefers keeping process disruptions to a minimum and, as a result, discourages product proliferation; however, marketing, in its attempt to match products to heterogeneous consumer needs and gain market share, emphasizes a broader product line. We systematically investigate the market benefits and cost disadvantages of broader product lines on a large sample of over 1,400 business units. Our results indicate significant market share benefits and increases in firms' profitability with broader product lines; moreover, widely held beliefs of increases in production costs are not empirically supported. American manufacturing firms may indeed be flexible enough to accommodate product variety without significant detrimental effects on costs.

## 7. Entrepreneurial Ability, Venture Investments, and Risk Sharing
### Author(s):
- Raphael Amit
- Lawrence Glosten
- Eitan Muller
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
A number of issues that relate to the desirability and implications of new venture financing are examined within a principal-agent framework that captures the essence of the relationship between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The model suggests: (1) As long as the skill levels of entrepreneurs are common knowledge, all will choose to involve venture capital investors, since the risk sharing provided by outside participation dominates the agency relationship that is created. (2) The less able entrepreneurs will choose to involve venture capitalists, whereas the more profitable ventures will be developed without external participation because of the adverse selection problem associated with asymmetric information. (3) If a costly signal is available that conveys the entrepreneur's ability, some entrepreneurs will invest in such a signal and then sell to investors; these entrepreneurs, however, need not be the more able ones. The implications for new venture financing of these and other findings are discussed and illustrated by example.

## 8. The Cooperative Venture Formation Process: A Latent Variable Structural Modeling Approach
### Author(s):
- Claes Fornell
- Peter Lorange
- Johan Roos
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This article addresses management process issues for forming cooperative ventures with an increased likelihood of subsequent success. Based on Roos (1989) the cooperative venture formation process is conceptualized in terms of three theoretical constructs: the extent of sufficient internal push for the project, the breadth and depth of analytical scope, and the strength of key stakeholder support. These constructs are related to subsequent perceived performance. Data from sixty seven firms were collected and analyzed via latent variable structural modeling a partial least square (PLS).

## 9. Management, Strategy, and Industry Structure As Influences on the Success of New Firms: A Structural Model
### Author(s):
- Robert H. Keeley
- Juan B. Roure
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This study develops and tests a model examining the interrelationships and relative importance of management characteristics, business strategy and industry structure as influences on the performance of new, technology based companies. For a sample of 36 companies the founding managers had a sizeable influence on the quality of the industry/strategy positions, though exogenous forces were even more important; and regardless of source, industry/strategy positions exerted important influence on performance. Management characteristics influenced success through implementation, in addition to their influence on industry/strategy.

## 10. Competitive Strategies for Late Entry into a Market with a Dominant Brand
### Author(s):
- Gregory S. Carpenter
- Kent Nakamoto
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This paper considers optimal positioning, advertising, and pricing strategies for a firm contemplating entry in a market dominated by an entrenched competitor. Drawing on behavioral research on consumer preference formation, we develop an individual-level model that reflects differing consumer responses to similar products offered by the dominant brand and later entrantsan effect we term asymmetric preferences. From the resulting aggregate market response model, we derive several competitive implications, notably (1) that preference asymmetry can make a differentiated late entry strategy optimal even if preferences would appear to dictate otherwise, and (2) that me-too strategies are not equilibrium late entry strategies. More generally, our analysis suggests that preference asymmetry can contribute to the persistent competitive advantage of dominant brands.

## 11. Product Innovation and Start-Up Business Market Share Performance
### Author(s):
- William T. Robinson
### Published:
- 1 Oct 1990
### Abstract:
This empirical study estimates the impact of several product innovation attributes on initial market share. We find that the product's advantage relative to competing products has the strongest market share impact. Incompatibility with customers' existing way of doing things does not have a meaningful market share impact. By reducing market share, a new and proprietary product technology tends to act as a barrier to adoption, unless the effect is offset by a major product advantage.
