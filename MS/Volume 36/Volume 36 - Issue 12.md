### Abstract:
Securities whose payoffs depend upon the actual path of the underlying state variables pose problems for standard backward-valuation techniques. In this paper, we show that there is a method of solving such problems that requires the addition of but a single auxiliary state variable. The technique is illustrated by examining an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) with yearly and lifetime caps. The ARM amortizes and can be prepaid at any time. We also handle other prominent features of ARMs including points and teasers. This method of using a single auxiliary state variable to handle path dependencies is a general one, applicable to more complex models of the economic environment and to other financial contracts.

## 2. Tax-Adjusted Discount Rates
### Author(s):
- Gordon A. Sick
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
This paper develops models for discount rates that are adjusted for the interest tax shields of an infra-marginal firm in a general tax equilibrium where there is cross-sectional variation in corporate tax rates. Under the assumption that the firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt ratio, a tax-adjusted riskless discount rate model is given for valuing certainty-equivalents and a tax-and-risk-adjusted discount rate model is given for valuing expected cash flows. For the latter case, the asset, equity, debt and tax-shield betas are derived and a weighted average cost of capital interpretation is given. The tax-adjusted CAPM/APT security market lines for expected returns in stock and bond markets both have the same slope but different intercepts. A formula is also provided for the present value of the interest tax shield when the firm optimally maintains a predetermined debt level.

## 3. Are Risk-Attitudes Related Across Domains and Response Modes?
### Author(s):
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
This paper examines experimentally the nature of people's risk-attitudes across different payoff domains and response modes. Only simple gambles are examined, entailing just two monetary outcomes. The main issue of interest is to what extent risk-preferences in one domain or response mode predict anything (beyond chance) about risk-preferences in another domain or mode. Three domains are examined: gain, mixed and loss. The three response modes used are certainty equivalence (CE), probability equivalence (PE) and outcome equivalence (OE) judgments.

## 4. Heuristics for Product-Line Design Using Conjoint Analysis
### Author(s):
- Rajeev Kohli
- R. Sukumar
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
Recently proposed methods for product-line selection use the total utilities of candidate items to construct product lines maximizing seller's return or buyers' welfare. For conjoint (hybrid conjoint) data, enumerating the utilities of candidate items can be computationally infeasible if the number of attributes and attribute levels is large and most multi-attribute alternatives are feasible. For such problems, constructing product lines directly from part-worths data is preferable. We propose such methods, extending Kohli and Krishnamurti's (1987) dynamic-programming heuristic for selecting a single item maximizing share to structure product lines maximizing share, seller's return, or buyers' (utilitarian) welfare. The computational performance of the heuristics and their approximation of product-line solutions is evaluated using simulated data. Across problem instances, the dynamic-programming heuristics identify solutions that are no worse, in terms of approximating optimal solutions, to the solutions of heuristics for the current two-step approaches to product-line design. An application using hybrid-conjoint data for a consumer-durable product is described.

## 5. Structured Prescriptive Models of Risk Attitudes
### Author(s):
- Charles M. Harvey
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
This paper discusses conditions on risk attitudes that imply special types of expected-utility functions. First, conditions are described that correspond to different choices of an arithmetic operation that measures the importance of changes in consequences. Second, conditions are described such that one consequence in a pair of indifferent lotteries depends linearly on a consequence in the other lottery. Procedures are described for using one of the conditions to model the risk attitude of a public or private decision making group without performing the detailed preference assessments that are needed to determine a general utility function.

## 6. User Delay Costs and Internal Pricing for a Service Facility
### Author(s):
- Sanjeev Dewan
- Haim Mendelson
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
This paper studies optimal pricing and capacity decisions for a service facility in an environment where users' delay cost is important. The model assumes a general nonlinear delay cost structure and incorporates the tradeoff between the delay cost and capacity cost. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of a pricing rule that charges out service resources at their marginal capacity cost. We examine the issue of budgetary balance and find that net-value maximization entails a budget deficit for the service facility; that is, the service facility should be evaluated as a deficit center. The results provide guidelines under which the optimal magnitude of the deficit can be determined.

## 7. The Impact of Uncertainty on a Production Line
### Author(s):
- Christopher S. Tang
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a discrete time model of a multi-stage production system that faces two major types of uncertainties: the output rate at each production stage and the demand for the finished product. Our goal is to analyze the impact of these uncertainties on the production level and on the inventory level at each stage in order to provide insights for production planning, inventory control, quality improvement, and capacity planning. We propose a scheme in which a complex production rule is approximated by a linear production rule (that follows the restoration concept introduced by Denardo and Tang 1988). This linear production rule leads the system to steady state in which the means and the variances of the production and inventory levels can be expressed in closed form. These closed form expressions enable us to develop a simple approach for determining a good production rule and for analyzing the impact of increasing the yield rates and reducing the variance of the demand. The goodness of this approximation scheme is illustrated by an example.

## 8. Adjusting Replenishment Orders to Reflect Learning in a Material Requirements Planning Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
Some manufacturing firms, particularly in the high-technology sector, have production processes which are characterized by very low initial yields followed by steady experience based yield improvement. Material Requirements Planning literature reveals that MRP implementations are seldom adjusted in any systematic way to account for such yield improvement. A single product, single stage MRP model is developed which incorporates learning curve behavior into conventional MRP logic. A series of experiments systematically examine the impact on mean inventory level of various combinations of environmental conditions and managerial policies. The research demonstrates that substantial reductions in mean inventory levels can be realized in low yield environments if learning is properly included in the order release logic. This finding proves to be robust with respect to modest errors in the estimation of learning rate.

## 9. Analysis of a Kanban Discipline for Cell Coordination in Production Lines. I
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
We describe and analyze a discipline called kanban for the coordination of cells in a large-scale manufacturing facility. There are many cells in a tandem configuration and a fixed number of cards (or kanbans in Japanese usage) in each cell. The cards circulate within the cell and their presence at designated positions signals to the neighboring cells the status of the cell's inventory; rules specify the timing of the movement of parts from cell to cell. We construct a stochastic model of the whole manufacturing facility and give our results in three parts. First, the kanban discipline is compared to the classical production discipline and it is shown to dominate the classical discipline in terms of throughput. Secondly, we give a scheme for analyzing approximately the performance of the kanban system by examining first a single cell in isolation and then combining the isolated cells through fixed-point equations. Thirdly, we report on extensive experiments and on their numerical results which are obtained from simulations and our method of analysis. The throughput-inventory relationship of the kanban scheme is observed to be superior to that of the classical discipline.

## 10. A Simulation Analysis of Factors Influencing the Attractiveness of Group Technology Cellular Layouts
### Author(s):
- John S. Morris
- Richard J. Tersine
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
Group Technology (GT) is a multi-faceted approach to batch production that includes the reconfiguration of plant equipment from a functional layout to a series of product-oriented layouts that are referred to as manufacturing cells. The cells are dedicated to process families of parts that have similar machine operations. The purported benefits of GT over traditional functional layouts range from reduced work-in-process inventory and throughput times to increased worker satisfaction and productivity. However, recent simulation studies challenge some of these claims of superior performance for cellular layouts.

## 11. Scheduling the Production of Several Items with Random Demands in a Single Facility
### Author(s):
- Guillermo Gallego
### Published:
- 1 Dec 1990
### Abstract:
Consider the problem of scheduling the production of several items in a single facility that can produce only one item at a time. This problem occurs since it is often economic to produce several items in a single facility. The objective is to reduce the long run average holding, backorder and setup costs.
