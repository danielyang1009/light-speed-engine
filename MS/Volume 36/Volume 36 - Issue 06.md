## 1. Gambling with the House Money and Trying to Break Even: The Effects of Prior Outcomes on Risky Choice
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
How is risk-taking affected by prior gains and losses? While normative theory implores decision makers to only consider incremental outcomes, real decision makers are influenced by prior outcomes. We first consider how prior outcomes are combined with the potential payoffs offered by current choices. We propose an editing rule to describe how decision makers frame such problems. We also present data from real money experiments supporting a house money effect (increased risk seeking in the presence of a prior gain) and break-even effects (in the presence of prior losses, outcomes which offer a chance to break even are especially attractive).

## 2. Performance of Shortest Path Algorithms in Network Flow Problems
### Author(s):
- James J. Divoky

### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
It is known that minimum cost flow problems can be solved by successive augmentations along shortest paths. In this paper the issues of implementing shortest path algorithms in this context are examined. Of particular interest is the dynamic topology that the flow networks exhibit. We develop a network generator capable of emulating such topology. Strategies for exploiting the special structures in such networks are discussed. A set of 9000 test problems is offered, from which a particular strategy/algorithm combination is shown to consistently produce superior results when compared to the other combinations.

## 3. Optimal Solution of Set Covering/Partitioning Problems Using Dual Heuristics
### Author(s):
- Marshall L. Fisher
- Pradeep Kedia
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
We present an algorithm for a mixed set covering/partitioning model that includes as special cases the well-known set covering problem and set partitioning problem. The novel feature of our algorithm is the use of continuous heuristics applied to the dual of the linear programming relaxation to provide lower bounds for a branch and bound algorithm. The heuristics are continuous adaptations of the well-known greedy and 3-opt methods that have been applied to a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. Our algorithm has outperformed the current best set covering algorithm of Balas and Ho (1980) by about a factor of 3, and appears to improve on the best existing set partitioning algorithm by more than an order of magnitude.

## 4. Effects of Anonymity and Evaluative Tone on Idea Generation in Computer-Mediated Groups
### Author(s):
- Terry Connolly
- Leonard M. Jessup
- Joseph S. Valacich
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
A laboratory experiment was used to evaluate the effects of anonymity and evaluative tone on computer-mediated groups using a group decision support system to perform an idea-generation task. Evaluative tone was manipulated through a confederate group member who entered supportive or critical comments into the automated brainstorming system. Groups working anonymously and with a critical confederate produced the greatest number of original solutions and overall comments, yet average solution quality per item and average solution rarity were not different across conditions. Identified groups working with a supportive confederate were the most satisfied and had the highest levels of perceived effectiveness, but produced the fewest original solutions and overall comments.

## 5. Communication and Income Smoothing Through Accounting Method Choice
### Author(s):
- Yoon S. Suh
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
This paper shows how accounting income smoothing could arise as rational equilibrium behavior. I develop a two-period agency model in which an agent obtains, after the first period's production operation, private information regarding future productivity of the operation. Direct communication of the agent's private signal yields a strict Pareto improvement over no-communication in this two-period world since it allows the agent to achieve signal-contingent interperiod consumption smoothing. Delegation of accounting method choice to the agent is shown to be an alternative, Pareto-equivalent mechanism to direct communication in this paper. Thus, accounting method choice is one way to achieve interperiod signal-contingent consumption smoothing by smoothing accounting income. One such accounting choice which arises from the structure of the problem is the choice of depreciation method.

## 6. Myopic Policies for Some Inventory Models with Uncertain Demand Distributions
### Author(s):
- William S. Lovejoy
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
The majority of papers on stochastic inventory theory make the assumption that the distribution of consumer demand in each time period is known with certainty. While this assumption is unsupported in many applied contexts, it is conventionally held that more realistic models are more difficult to solve and will not yield simple operational policies. This paper shows that a simple inventory policy based upon a critical fractile can be optimal or near-optimal in some inventory models with parameter adaptive demand processes. In these, some parameter of the demand distribution is not known with certainty, and estimates of the parameter are updated in a statistical fashion as demand is observed through time. Examples include exponentially smoothed forecasts and Bayesian updating of parameter estimates. Bounds on the value loss relative to optimal cost, when using the critical fractile policy, can be calculated directly from the problem data. Some numerical examples illustrate the technique.

## 7. User Satisfaction with Computer-Mediated Communication Systems
### Author(s):

- Kenneth Johnson
### Published:
- 1 Jun 1990
### Abstract:
Interactive computer systems should be viewed as socio-technical systems whose acceptance is influenced by an interaction among characteristics of the individual users, the groups and organizations in which they are implemented, and the computer systems themselves. Four months after completing baseline questionnaires, new users of four computer-mediated communication systems (CMCS) answered follow-up questionnaires which included a number of items measuring subjective satisfaction. Factor analysis identified two primarily instrumental dimensions (satisfaction with the Interface and with system Performance), and two primarily social-emotional dimensions (Unexpressiveperceived inadequacy of the system for expressive, emotional, or personal communicationand Mode Problems with computer-mediated communication). The strongest correlates of Interface satisfaction are differences in system software and documentation, interacting with baseline attitudes and characteristics of the individual users. By contrast, the strongest correlates of the Unexpressive factor include such group-level variables as frequency of previous (off-line) communication with the group, and attitudes towards the group task. Thus to insure a successful implementation, managers must consider the fit between a CMCS and a particular work group.
