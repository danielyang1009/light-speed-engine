## 1. Unanimity and Compromise Among Probability Forecasters

### Abstract:
When two forecasters agree regarding the probability of an uncertain event, should a decision maker adopt that probability as his or her own? A decision maker who does so is said to act in accord with the unanimity principle. We examine a variety of Bayesian consensus models with respect to their conformance (or lack thereof) to the unanimity principle and a more general compromise principle. In an analysis of a large set of probability forecast data from meteorology, we show how well the various models, when fit to the data, reflect the empirical pattern of conformance to these principles.

## 2. Venture Theory: A Model of Decision Weights
### Author(s):

### Published:

### Abstract:
Several theories suggest that people replace probabilities by decision weights when evaluating risky outcomes. This paper proposes a model, called venture theory, of how people assess decision weights. It is assumed that people first anchor on a stated probability and then adjust this by mentally simulating other possible values. The amount of mental simulation is affected by the absolute size of payoffs, the extent to which the anchor deviates from the extremes of 0 and 1, and the level of perceived ambiguity concerning the relevant probability. The net effect of the adjustment (i.e., up or down vis--vis the anchor) reflects the relative weight given in imagination to values above as opposed to below the anchor. This, in turn, is taken to be a function of both individual and situational variables, and in particular, the sign and size of payoffs. Cognitive and motivational factors therefore both play important roles in determining decision weights. Assuming that people evaluate outcomes by a prospect theory value function (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) and are cautious in the face of risk, fourteen predictions are derived concerning attitudes toward risk and ambiguity as functions of different levels of payoffs and probabilities. The results of three experiments are reported. Whereas only a subset of the model's predictions can be tested in Experiment 1, all fourteen are tested in Experiments 2 and 3 using hypothetical and real payoffs, respectively. Several of the model's predictions are not supported in Experiment 2 but almost all are validated in Experiments 1 and 3. The failures relate to the exact nature of probability  payoff interactions in attitudes toward risk and ambiguity for losses. The theory and results are discussed in relation to other experimental evidence, future tests of the theory, alternative models of risky choice, and implications of venture theory for explaining further phenomena.

## 3. A New Look at the Returns and Risks to Pharmaceutical R&D
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jul 1990
### Abstract:
This study investigates the returns to R&D for 100 new drugs introduced into the United States during the decade of the 1970s. In contrast to prior studies, it incorporates several significant structural changes that have occurred in the pharmaceutical industry during the 1980s. These include higher real drug prices and a greater degree of generic competition. A major finding is that the return on R&D for the average new drug is approximately equal to the 9 percent industry cost of capital. However, the performance of new drugs introduced during the latter half of the 1970s was markedly better than that of early 1970s introductions. This latter finding is consistent with the more rapid rate of industry growth in real R&D expenditures. The study also finds that the variation in returns is highly skewed, with only the top 30 drugs covering mean R&D costs on a fully allocated basis. Finally, it is shown that real drug price increases in the 1980s were necessary for the average new drug introduction to recover its R&D costs.

## 4. Power Approximation for Computing (s, S) Policies Using Service Level
### Author(s):

- Jeffrey L. Ringuest
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1990
### Abstract:
The paper presents an analytic approximation for computing (s, S) policies for single items under periodic review with fixed ordering costs, linear holding costs and a service level requirement. The replenishment lead time is fixed and unfilled demand is backlogged. The approximation is similar to Ehrhardt's Power Approximation. However, we do not assume the knowledge of shortage costs, which are difficult to estimate in practice. We define a -service level which measures the average backlog relative to the average demand. This quantity is easy to understand and frequently used in practice. The resulting power approximation policies are easy to compute and require only knowledge of the mean and variance of demand. Computational results show that the approximation gives a -service level which is within one percentage point of the required service level in most cases. Furthermore, the expected total costs of the approximation, taking into consideration a penalty cost for stockouts, are well within one percent of optimal.

## 5. Control Variates for Quantile Estimation
### Author(s):
- Jason C. Hsu
- Barry L. Nelson
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1990
### Abstract:
New point and interval estimators for quantiles that employ a control variate are introduced. The properties of these estimators do not depend on the usual assumption of joint normality between the random variable of interest and the control. Illustrative examples for queueing and stochastic activity network models are given. In those examples, the new estimators are superior to the standard estimator in terms of the mean squared error of the point estimator and the length of the confidence interval.

## 6. Design and Performance Models for End-of-Aisle Order Picking Systems
### Author(s):
- Yavuz A. Bozer
- John A. White
### Published:
- 1 Jul 1990
### Abstract:
The design of end-of-aisle order picking systems is addressed by focusing on a miniload automated storage/retrieval system. Performance models are developed for the miniload and a design algorithm is presented. The design algorithm has as its objective the minimization of the number of storage aisles subject to two types of capacity constraints: throughput and storage space. Although the system with two pick positions can be modeled directly as a closed queueing network with two servers and two customers, its special structure led to an alternative approach in developing the performance model. For two and more pick positions, the results obtained are compared with those obtainable using simulation and a diffusion approximation.
