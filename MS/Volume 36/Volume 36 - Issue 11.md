## 1. The Fair and Efficient Division of the Winsor Family Silver
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
This is the true story of the actual use of a formal, decentralized division procedure to allocate silver heirlooms among eight grandchildren fairly and efficiently without distasteful direct monetary payments. Each grandchild's stated preferences for objects in contention were roughly represented by a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Allocations were made as they would be in a market for probability shares in the objects, assuming each grandchild had a fixed amount of an artificial currency and made optimal purchases. The market-clearing equilibrium prices were chosen as in a second-price auction to reward honest reporting. Although the procedure was decentralized and most participants did not fully understand it or the preference information desired, it handled all major considerations well and was regarded as equitable.

## 2. A Data Envelopment Model for Aggregating Preference Rankings
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a general model for aggregating votes from a preferential ballot. The thrust of the model is to accord each candidate a fair assessment in terms of his overall standing vis-a-vis first place, second place, , kth place votes. The form of the model is a combined index j = 1kWjvij where vij is the number of the jth place votes received by the ith candidate. The weights Wj are assumed to form a monotonically decreasing sequence with Wj  Wj + 1  d(j, ). These constraints correspond to the assurance region (AR) side constraints in the DEA framework. The properties of the model are examined in terms of this discrimination intensity function d, and in the special case that d(j, ) = , our model is shown to be equivalent to the consensus models of Borda and Kendall.

## 3. Output Decision Under Demand Uncertainty with Stochastic Production Function: A Contingent Claims Approach
### Author(s):
- Kee H. Chung
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a contingent claims analysis of output decisions for the firm facing technological and demand uncertainty. The paper reveals that: (i) the optimal output level increases with the higher interest rate when the firm is subject to demand (and technological) uncertainty; (ii) the effect of demand volatility and production lead time on the optimal output level could be either positive or negative; (iii) the optimal project value decreases with the higher demand volatility; (iv) the optimal project value decreases with the longer production lead time when the firm is subject to demand uncertainty; and (v) the optimal project value decreases with the higher interest rate when the firm is subject to demand uncertainty; it increases with the higher interest rate, however, when the firm is subject to both demand and technological uncertainty. Some important managerial implications are discussed.

## 4. Modelling Emergency Lateral Transshipments in Inventory Systems
### Author(s):
- Sven Axster
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
In inventory systems with several bases that support different geographical regions, it is quite common to allow emergency lateral transshipments between the bases. This may be advantageous if neighbouring bases are at shorter distances than the central depot or the external supplier. This paper provides a new technique for modelling such lateral transshipments in continuous review inventory systems with one-for-one replenishments and Poisson demand. We apply this technique to a two-echelon system with repairable items.

## 5. Implicit Modeling of Flexible Break Assignments in Optimal Shift Scheduling
### Author(s):
- Stephen E. Bechtold
- Larry W. Jacobs
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
The labor scheduling literature has demonstrated that the use of flexibility in designing employee schedules can result in a substantial improvement in labor utilization. This paper presents a new implicit integer linear programming formulation for the inclusion of meal/rest-break flexibility. Although the use of flexible break assignments in labor staffing decisions has been of research interest since an early article by Segal (1974), due to problem size, the majority of related research has involved the use of heuristics. An experimental analysis using four different labor requirements patterns and ten shift-length combinations demonstrated that, when flexible break assignments were modeled, the implicit formulation was superior to the traditional set-covering formulation with respect to 1) execution time, 2) computer memory requirements, and 3) the ability to produce optimal integer solutions to larger problems incorporating greater flexibility. Finally, a number of possible extensions of the implicit modeling approach for use in other labor scheduling environments are identified.

## 6. Subcontracting, Coordination, Flexibility, and Production Smoothing in Aggregate Planning
### Author(s):
- Morton I. Kamien
- Lode Li
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
We propose a model in which subcontracting can be explicitly considered as a production planning strategy. Possible market and nonmarket subcontracting mechanisms and their costs are discussed. We show that a class of feasible subcontracting mechanisms in which firms coordinate their production via subcontracts Pareto-dominate other mechanisms. We then offer an example with quadratic cost functions and coordination subcontracts; linear decision rules for production, inventory, and subcontracting are derived. In the example, subcontracting reduces the variability in production and inventory. The same interpretation can be used for flexibility of manufacturing resources.

## 7. A Unified View of the IPA, SF, and LR Gradient Estimation Techniques
### Author(s):
- Pierre L'Ecuyer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
We study the links between the likelihood-ratio (LR) gradient-estimation technique (sometimes called the score-function (SF) method), and infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA). We show how IPA can be viewed as a (degenerate) special case of the LR and SF techniques by selecting an appropriate representation of the underlying sample space for a given simulation experiment. We also show how different definitions of the sample space yield different variants of the LR method, some of them mixing IPA with more straightforward LR. We illustrate this by many examples. We also give sufficient conditions under which the gradient estimators are unbiased.

## 8. A Quantitative Analysis of U.S. and Japanese Practice and Performance in Software Development
### Author(s):
- Michael A. Cusumano
- Chris F. Kemerer
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
Since the early 1980s, there has been a mounting debate in industry literature and in U.S. government-sponsored reports over the relative performance of software developers in Japan versus those in the United States. This literature is somewhat divided between assertions of Japanese or U.S. superiority in this technology, although many observers in the popular business press continue to insist that the U.S. maintains an overwhelming lead in this technology. However, both sides of the debate have offered evidence that, to date, has been primarily qualitative or based on one or two cases.

## 9. Reducing Separable Convex Programs with Tree Constraints
### Author(s):
- Christopher S. Tang
### Published:
- 1 Nov 1990
### Abstract:
This paper describes a class of separable convex programs with tree constraints that has applications in production planning, quality improvement, and other related areas. A reduction procedure is presented for solving this class of separable convex programs with N variables. This reduction procedure determines an optimal solution to the convex problem by solving at most 2N simple convex subproblems with one variable. Hence, this reduction procedure is an efficient approach for solving large scale convex programs of this sort.
