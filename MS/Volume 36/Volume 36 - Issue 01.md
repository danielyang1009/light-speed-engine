## 1. A Dynamic Programming Approach to a Class of Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Problems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a new approach to modeling, analyzing, and solving a class of environmental control problems dealing with sediment deposition. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is designed to handle the spatial characteristics of soil movement through a watershed, and its ultimate impact on water channels and/or reservoirs. The model generates sediment abatement cost frontiers which summarize the trade-off information needed for watershed planning and management. This information can also be used to identify and target special-problem areas. The paper presents both results on the efficiency of the DP algorithm compared to other methods, and results on the application of the model to real world cases.

## 2. Covering-Location Models for Emergency Situations That Require Multiple Response Units
### Author(s):
- Rajan Batta
- Narasimha R. Mannur
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
In this paper we propose a new criterion for coverage which is suitable for two kinds of applications: (i) location of fire trucks in a geographical area in which some demands require multiple fire trucks to be within an acceptable distance standard to achieve coverage; and (ii) location of ambulances in an environment in which a large demand volume often leads to the unavailability of the most desirable response unit. The set covering location problem and the maximal covering location problem are examined in the proposed modeling framework. Properties for these models are developed, and limited computational experience is reported.

## 3. The Effect of Information Sources and Communication Channels on the diffusion of Innovation in a Data Base Development Environment
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
Increasing importance of emerging information technology, especially the data base component, has prompted the examination of the process of diffusion of innovations in the context of data base system development. This paper (1) examines the extent to which information sources and communication channels facilitate the diffusion of data base design tools and techniques, (2) studies how different information sources and communication channels influence diffusion and (3) assesses whether data base design tools and techniques applicable to the different stages of system development are diffused at different rates. In facilitating the diffusion of data base design tools and techniques, organizational resources such as information sources, communication channels and a technical support function are found to influence only certain classes of these innovations.

## 4. Uncapacitated Plant Location Under Alternative Spatial Price Policies
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
Given a spatial system of clients' demand functions, this paper proposes solution methods to determine the price(s), the number, the locations, the sizes, and the market areas of the plants supplying the clients in order to maximize the profit of the firm. Three alternative spatial price policies are considered: (i) uniform mill pricing, in which the same price is charged to the clients at the plant door, (ii) uniform delivered pricing, in which clients pay the same delivered price irrespective of their locations, and (iii) spatial discriminatory pricing, which is such that the firm sets client-specific prices based on their locations. Computational results are reported.

## 5. Interactive Multiobjective Optimization Under Uncertainty
### Author(s):
- G. Klein
- H. Moskowitz
- A. Ravindran
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
Uncertainty presents unique difficulties in multiobjective optimization problems, because decision makers are faced with risky situations requiring analysis of multiple outcomes in differing states of nature. Very few direct choice (interactive) multiobjective methods are capable of addressing problems with probabilistic outcomes. We thus propose a general multiobjective algorithm which accommodates uncertainty. The method is appropriate for use in a multiple criteria framework with a discrete number of states of nature. Without loss of generality, and in the interest of simplicity of exposition, our method is explored and developed in the context of a bicriterion optimization problem using a two stage mathematical programming model. Simulation and behavioral experiments are conducted which verify that the method is viable for problems with greater dimensionality.

## 6. A Theoretical Assessment of the User-Satisfaction Construct in Information Systems Research
### Author(s):
- Nancy Paule Melone
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
For nearly two decades, the user-satisfaction construct has occupied a central role in behavioral research in Information Systems (IS). In industry, the construct has often been used as a surrogate for IS effectiveness. Given its widespread use by both academics and practitioners, it is surprising that no comprehensive theoretical assessment of this construct has been performed. This paper provides such a review. It begins by examining conceptual and theoretical limitations of the construct's use as a measure of IS effectiveness. Attention is then focused on the evolution of the construct in the literature and the theoretical problems associated with its broader use. The fundamental similarity between user satisfaction and the social and cognitive psychologists' notion of an attitude is suggested. The next sections focus on a discussion of attitude structures and function. First, alternative theoretical views on attitude structure are presented. While one of these structures, the family of expectancy-value models, is reflected in current research on user satisfaction, the second, the family of cognitive approaches, is not. The two attitude structures are considered from the perspective of possible refinements to future work in IS. Next, an examination is made of the ways in which these structures have been integrated in terms of understanding the relationship of users' affective responses to other responses (i.e., behavior or cognition). This leads to a discussion of the function attitudes might serve for the user other than the evaluation of an information system or IS staff. Finally, the question of how behavior influences attitude is considered. The paper concludes with suggestions for future work.

## 7. One Warehouse Multiple Retailer Systems with Vehicle Routing Costs
### Author(s):
- S. Anily
- A. Federgruen
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
We consider distribution systems with a depot and many geographically dispersed retailers each of which faces external demands occurring at constant, deterministic but retailer specific rates. All stock enters the system through the depot from where it is distributed to the retailers by a fleet of capacitated vehicles combining deliveries into efficient routes. Inventories are kept at the retailers but not at the depot.

## 8. Equivalent Formulations of Nonlinear Integer Problems for Efficient Optimization
### Author(s):
- Ossama Kettani
- Muhittin Oral
### Published:
- 1 Jan 1990
### Abstract:
The linearization technique of Glover, which seems to be the most efficient one appearing in the literature, requires the addition of n new continuous variables (unconstrained in sign) and 4n new linear constraints to equivalently represent a 0-1 quadratic integer problem with n variables. This paper shows that it is still possible to improve such a procedure. In fact, the number of new continuous variables can be kept at n (but constrained in sign) while further reducing the number of new linear constraints from 4n to 2n.
