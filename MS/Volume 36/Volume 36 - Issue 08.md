## 1. Database Models and Managerial Intuition: 50% Model + 50% Manager
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
We focus on ways of combining simple database models with managerial intuition. We present a model and method for isolating managerial intuition. For five different business forecasting situations, our results indicate that a combination of model and manager always outperforms either of these decision inputs in isolation, an average R2 increase of 0.09 (16%) above the best single decision input in cross-validated model analyses. We assess the validity of an equal weighting heuristic, 50% model + 50% manager, and then discuss why our results might differ from previous research on expert judgment.

## 2. Market Share Pioneering Advantage: A Theoretical Approach

### Abstract:
In this paper we present an industry in which a pioneer has entered, accumulated capital in the form of goodwill, and in his monopoly period has also reduced his cost of production as a result of some form of learning by doing. At some later date a newcomer enters. His production cost is higher than that of the monopolist at that date. However due to diffusion of information, the costs of the two firms equate at some future date.

## 3. Steady-State Approximation for a Vector Valued Markov Chain
### Author(s):
- Timothy S. Vaughan
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
The problem addressed is that of a condensed steady-state solution for the Markov Chain (X(t), S(t)). The steady state marginal distribution of S(t) is known; we desire only the steady state marginal distribution of X(t). Such a case frequently arises when the supplementary random variable S(t) is required in the state description solely to satisfy the Markovian assumption. An iterative algorithm is presented which makes use of an approximation to the conditional distribution for S(t) given X(t).

## 4. Queues with Slowly Varying Arrival and Service Processes
### Author(s):
- Erol Gelenbe

### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
We examine a generalisation of the M/G/1 queue. The arrival and service processes are governed by a Markov chain which determines the rate of arrival and the service time distribution from a finite set. This Markov chain is assumed to vary slowly, so that we are able to derive analytical results for the stationary distribution of the queue length using an approach based on decomposability. The practical interest of this model stems from the numerous applications where the parameters of queueing systems are time varying, such as inventory models, telephone systems, time-sharing systems, computer networks with bursty traffic, etc. We also show how this approach can be extended to arbitrary networks of queues and in particular to those with product form solution.

## 5. Shared Learning
### Author(s):
- Paul S. Adler
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
Total productivity learning curve results are reported for several departments of an electronic equipment manufacturer with plants in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These results were used to focus qualitative field investigations into the behavioral and cognitive determinants of considerable diversity across departments in learning curve parameters. The field investigation suggested that three forms of shared learning are critical to manufacturing productivity improvement: (1) sharing across the Development/Manufacturing interface, (2) sharing between the primary location and plants that started up later, and (3) the ongoing sharing among plants after start-up. Innovations in each of these three processes are identified and mapped onto Daft and Lengel's information uncertainty/equivocality matrix. Implications for the role of manufacturing engineering are identified.

## 6. Accumulation Point Location on Tree Networks for Guaranteed Time Distribution
### Author(s):

- H. Donald Ratliff
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
A guaranteed time distribution system is organized so that movement of items between any source-destination pair (serviced by the system) is completed within a guaranteed period of time (T). Various express mail services are examples of such distribution systems. The movement of items between source and destination consists of a combination of different modes of travel with varying speeds (i.e. trucks, airplanes etc.). Decisions have to be made regarding location of accumulation points (called local centers) at which changes in the mode of travel occur. All customers have to be allocated to these local centers so as to provide the best (minimum) time guarantee for travel between every source-destination pair. Accumulated flows between local centers pass through a global center in a centralized sorting system (CSS) and move directly between local centers in a decentralized sorting system (DSS). For tree structured distribution systems we provide polynomial time algorithms that locate a given number of local centers, allocate customers to local centers and provide the best possible time guarantee for both centralized and decentralized guaranteed time distribution systems.

## 7. Conflicting Interests in the Timing of Jobs
### Author(s):
- Ann Van Ackere
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
We study a situation where jobs of unknown duration (e.g., surgical procedures) are performed sequentially in a single facility (e.g., a hospital operating room). This facility can be any resource (material or human) that is in limited supply. Due to the uncertain duration of jobs, the time at which the facility will be available for the next job is unknown. Given the existing schedule, a starting time is selected for the next job. The scheduler's task is complicated because a job necessitates the presence of (at least) one individual (e.g., the surgeon), called the agent.

## 8. Scheduling Economic Lot Size Production Runs
### Author(s):
- Samuel G. Davis
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
Single capacitated production facilities where multiple products are produced pose particularly challenging scheduling problems. The traditional economic lot size calculation reflects the optimum production batch size in the light of the tradeoff between inventory carrying costs and order preparation/setup costs. However, these calculations are straightforward only when applied to a single product. When multiple products are produced on the same facility, the production quantities must be translated into a schedule which is within the capacity of the facility and results in the timely satisfaction of demand for each product.

## 9. NoteThe Impact of Inspection Delay on Process and Inspection Lot Sizing
### Author(s):
- Evan L. Porteus
### Published:
- 1 Aug 1990
### Abstract:
Models in which process quality and lot sizing interact have recently been developed. Lot sizes should be reduced to compensate for poor quality if no effective inspection is possible. This note introduces an inspection delay time, measured in units produced after an inspection is made until results are known. If the inspection delay is negligible, then the problem reduces essentially to two separate lot sizing problems: the classical EOQ lot sizing problem and an inspection lot sizing problem. If the delay is great, then only one inspection should be made and the lot size is as given by Porteus, and Rosenblatt and Lee. This note seeks the optimal production and inspection lot sizes for the full spectrum of inspection delays. The impact of the results is illustrated numerically. The value of automated defect control (with 100% inspection and immediate production stoppage upon detection of a defect) is discussed.
