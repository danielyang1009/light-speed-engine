## 1. Information Technology Implementation Research: A Technological Diffusion Approach
### Author(s):
- Randolph B. Cooper
- Robert W. Zmud
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
Based on the innovation and technological diffusion literatures, promising research questions concerning the implementation of a production and inventory control information system (material requirements planning: MRP) are identified and empirically examined. These questions focus on the interaction of managerial tasks with the information technology and the resulting effect on the adoption and infusion of that technology.

## 2. The Persistence and Transfer of Learning in Industrial Settings

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
The persistence of learning within organizations and the transfer of learning across organizations are examined on data collected from multiple organizations. Results indicate that knowledge acquired through production depreciates rapidly. The conventional measure of learning, cumulative output, significantly overstates the persistence of learning. There is some evidence that learning transfers across organizations: organizations beginning production later are more productive than those with early start dates. Once organizations begin production, however, they do not appear to benefit from learning in other organizations. The implications of the results for a theory of organizational learning are discussed. Managerial implications are described.

## 3. Optimal Bundle Pricing
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
Bundle pricing is a widespread phenomenon. However, despite its importance as a pricing tool, surprisingly little is known about how to find optimal bundle prices. Most discussions in the literature are restricted to only two components, and even in this case no algorithm is given for setting prices. Here we show that the single firm bundle pricing problem is naturally viewed as a disjunctive program which is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. Multiple components, and a variety of cost and reservation price conditions are investigated with this approach. Several new economic insights on the role and effectiveness of bundling are presented. An added benefit of the solution to the bundle pricing model is the selection of products which compose the firm's product line. Computational testing is done on problems with up to 21 components (over one million potential product bundles), and data collection issues are addressed.

## 4. Product Positioning Under Price Competition
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a consumer-based methodology for new product pricing and positioning in the face of price competition. The price competition is modelled as a Nash equilibrium for which two complementary approaches are employed: an analytical approach of duopoly provides qualitative insights into the competitive behavior, and a numerical approach of general oligopoly provides quantitative solutions under a wide variety of market scenarios. The optimal product positioning is formulated as a Stackelberg-Nash (leader-followers) equilibrium which can be solved numerically using recent advances in the field of variational inequalities. A small example concerning analgesics is used to illustrate this methodology.

## 5. Confidence Interval Estimation for the Variance Parameter of Stationary Processes
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
Asymptotic confidence interval estimators of the variance parameter 2 = limn   n Var((1/n) ni = 1 Xi) are described in this paper for observations X1, X2,,Xn from a strictly stationary phi-mixing stochastic process. They are based on asymptotic properties of the standardized time series of observations from the process. The new point and interval estimators for the variance parameter are compared to the classical batch means estimator. The results show that the new estimators have asymptotic properties that clearly dominate the classical estimator. Also, asymptotic confidence interval estimators for the ratio of two variance parameters representing two independent processes are discussed.

## 6. Routing and Scheduling on a Shoreline with Release Times

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
In this paper we examine computational complexity issues and develop algorithms for a class of shoreline single-vehicle routing and scheduling problems with release time constraints. Problems in this class are interesting for both practical and theoretical reasons. From a practical perspective, these problems arise in several transportation environments. For instance, in the routing and scheduling of cargo ships, the routing structure is easy because the ports to be visited are usually located along a shoreline. However, because release times of cargoes at ports generally complicate the routing structure, the combined routing and scheduling problem is nontrivial. For the straight-line case (a restriction of the shoreline case), our analysis shows that the problem of minimizing the maximum completion time can be solved exactly in quadratic time by dynamic programming. For the shoreline case we develop and analyze heuristic algorithms. We derive data-dependent worst-case performance ratios for these heuristics that are bounded by constant. We also discuss how these algorithms perform on practical data.

## 7. Industry Investment in Basic Research Assuming Interdependence of Benefits from Appropriable and Inappropriable Activities
### Author(s):
- Prafulla Joglekar
### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
Using a model of the resource allocation behavior of a group of firms, Joglekar and Hamburg (1983) demonstrate that unaided industry allocation to basic research is suboptimal and that in stimulating this allocation, provision of government seed money is generally counterproductive, while the provision of matching subsidies is not cost-efficient. Using basically the same model, but focusing on the case of a homogeneous industry, Joglekar and Hamburg (1986) further identify several industry characteristics that increase the degree of suboptimality of investment in basic research, and consequently, the need for government intervention. Joglekar and Hamburg (1983), (1986) assume that a firm's benefits from its investment in appropriable activities are independent of its benefits from the industry's total investment in the pertinent basic (i.e., inappropriable) research. Investment theory suggests that a firm's benefits often depend upon its investment portfolio and that an investment in basic research that is not supported by suitable investments in other activities (e.g., plant and equipment, personnel training, etc.) may yield far smaller benefits than could be potentially obtained. Therefore, in this paper, I present a model that assumes such an interdependence of benefits. I find that most of Joglekar and Hamburg's (1983), (1986) conclusions are confirmed by the new model.

## 8. On the Effectiveness of Direct Shipping Strategy for the One-Warehouse Multi-Retailer R-Systems
### Author(s):

### Published:
- 1 Feb 1990
### Abstract:
We consider the problem of integrating inventory control and vehicle routing into a cost-effective strategy for a distribution system consisting of one depot and many geographically dispersed retailers. All stock enters the system through the depot and is distributed to the retailers by vehicles of limited constant capacity. We assume that each one of the retailers faces a constant, retailer specific, demand rate and that inventory is charged only at the retailers but not at the depot. We provide a lower bound on the long run average cost over all inventory-routing strategies. We use this lower bound to show that the effectiveness of direct shipping over all inventory-routing strategies is at least 94% whenever the Economic Lot Size of each of the retailers is at least 71% of vehicle capacity. The effectiveness deteriorates as the Economic Lot Sizes become smaller. These results are important because they provide useful guidelines as to when to embark into the much more difficult task of finding cost-effective routes. Additional advantages of direct shipping are lower in-transit inventory and ease of coordination.
