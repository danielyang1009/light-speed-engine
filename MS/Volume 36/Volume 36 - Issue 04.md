## 1. Prelaunch Forecasting of New Automobiles

### Abstract:
This paper develops and applies a prelaunch model and measurement system to the marketing planning of a new automobile. The analysis addresses active search by consumers, dealer visits, word-of-mouth communication, magazine reviews, and production constraintsissues that are important in understanding consumer response to durable goods. We address these issues with a detailed consumer flow model which monitors and projects key consumer transitions in response to marketing actions. A test-vs.-control consumer clinic provides data which, with judgment and previous experience, are used to calibrate the model to fit the sales history of the control car. We illustrate how the model evolved to meet management needs and provided suggestions on advertising, dealer training, and consumer incentives. Comparison of the model's predictions to actual sales data suggests reasonable accuracy when an implemented strategy matches the planned strategy.

## 2. Characteristics of Risk Taking Executives

### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
More than 500 top-level business executives were studied to ascertain the validity of common stereotypes of who takes risks and who avoids risks. We began with 13 risk measures based on theoretical grounds, naturally occurring situations, and attitudes. These measures were formed into seven consolidated measures using factor analysis. Data were gathered on numerous socio-economic variables including ones relating to personal, financial, and professional characteristics. When these characteristics were subjected to factor analysis, four main factors emerged. Linear discriminant analysis was used to address the question of whether risk takers can be differentiated from risk averters. The results were surprisingly clearcut. The most successful executives were the biggest risk takers; the most mature executives were the most risk averse.

## 3. Conflict in Organizational Decision Making: An Exploratory Study of Its Effects in For-Profit and Not-For-Profit Organizations
### Author(s):
- Charles R. Schwenk
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
Though past research has shown that conflict may improve organizational decision making, business executives may have very different perceptions of the effects of conflict than executives of not-for-profit organizations. This exploratory study deals with executives' descriptions of the effects of conflict on their own organizations' decisions. Results show that high conflict is associated with high quality for the executives of not-for-profit organizations but with low quality for executives of for-profit organizations. Analysis of executives' written descriptions of these decisions suggests some reasons for this difference.

## 4. Optimal Investment in Product-Flexible Manufacturing Capacity
### Author(s):
- Charles H. Fine
- Robert M. Freund
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
This paper presents a model and an analysis of the cost-flexibility tradeoffs involved in investing in product-flexible manufacturing capacity. Flexible capacity provides a firm with the ability to respond to a wide variety of future demand outcomes, but at the expense of the increased cost of acquiring flexible manufacturing capacity, as compared with dedicated or nonflexible capacity. We formulate the product-flexible manufacturing capacity investment decision as a two-stage stochastic program. In the first stage, the firm must make its investment decision in manufacturing capacity, before the resolution of uncertainty in product demand. In the second stage, after demand for products are known, the firm implements its production decisions, constrained by the first-stage investments.

## 5. Some Heuristics for Scheduling Jobs on Parallel Machines with Setups
### Author(s):
- Kut C. So
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
This paper studies the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines with setup times. When a machine switches from processing one type of job to another type, setup times are incurred. The problem is to find a feasible schedule for each machine which maximizes the total reward. We study three heuristics for solving this problem. Analytical and empirical results of the heuristics are given.

## 6. Foreign Market Entry: Production-Related Strategies
### Author(s):
- Ming-Je Tang
- Chwo-Ming Joseph Yu
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
This paper examines the profit to a firm of different production-related strategies for entering a foreign market. The entry strategies examined are foreign direct investment, exclusive licensing, multiple licensing, joint venture, and a combination of joint venture and licensing. It is shown that even though the entering firm is able to charge the optimal licensing fee, foreign direct investment generates the highest profit and is thus the dominant entry strategy in many contexts. This paper also suggests counter-strategies for responding to government restrictions on firms' entry.

## 7. Evaluating Forecast Performance in an Inventory Control System
### Author(s):
- Everette S. Gardner
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
This paper analyzes the impact of forecasting on inventory decisions in a large physical distribution system. Alternative forecasting models are evaluated by developing tradeoff curves between inventory investment and customer service. The results demonstrate that the choice of forecasting model is an important factor in determining the amount of investment needed to support any target level of customer service.

## 8. NoteDerivation of Covariance Probit Elasticities
### Author(s):
- Charles F. Hofacker
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
The full covariance probit model is highly regarded due to the flexibility with which it can represent cross brand effects. Explicit formulae for these cross brand effects for the general N brand case have never appeared in print, nor have the direct elasticities for the model. This note fills that omission.

## 9. NoteSliding Simulation: A New Approach to Time Series Forecasting
### Author(s):
- Spyros Makridakis
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
This paper proposes a new approach to time series forecasting based upon three premises. First, a model is selected not by how well it fits historical data but on its ability to accurately predict out-of-sample actual data. Second, a model/method is selected among several run in parallel using out-of-sample information. Third, models/methods are optimized for each forecasting horizon separately, making it possible to have different models/methods to predict each of the m horizons. This approach outperforms the best method of the M-Competition by a large margin when tested empirically with the 111 series subsample of the M-Competition data.

## 10. NoteA Branch-and-Fathom Algorithm for the Long Range Process Design Problem
### Author(s):
- Jaya Singhal
- Joseph L. Katz
### Published:
- 1 Apr 1990
### Abstract:
Several problems, including the long-range process design problem, have been formulated as a compatibility matrix. Earlier, Singhal et al. (1988) proposed a partial enumeration algorithm which found all feasible designs and reported computational results. However, for large problems, the partial enumeration algorithm requires an excessive amount of computational effort to locate all feasible designs. This paper presents a branch and fathom algorithm which is more efficient than the partial enumeration algorithm, and which significantly reduces the computational effort necessary to identify all feasible designs.
