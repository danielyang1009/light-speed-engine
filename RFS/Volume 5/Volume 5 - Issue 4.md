## 1. A Theory of the Nominal Term Structure of Interest Rates
### Date

### Author
- George M. Constantinides
### Abstract
A model of the nominal term structure of interest rates is developed that has a positive and stationary process for the interest rate and delivers closed-form expressions for the prices of discount bonds and European options on bonds. Unlike the one-state-variable version of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) model, this model—even in its one-state-variable version—allows the term premium to change sign as a function of the state and the term to maturity, and also allows for shapes of the yield curve that are observed in the U.S. data but that are disallowed in the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model

## 2. Survivorship Bias in Performance Studies

### Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that past mutual fund performance predicts future performance. We analyze the relationship between volatility and returns in a sample that is truncated by survivorship and show that this relationship gives rise to the appearance of predictability. We present some numerical examples to show that this effect can be strong enough to account for the strength of the evidence favoring return predictability.

## 3. Real and Nominal Interest Rates: A Discrete-Time Model and Its Continuous-Time Limit
### Date

### Author
- Tong-sheng Sun
### Abstract
I provide a general equilibrium theory of the term structure of real interest rates in a discrete-time economy. I derive the prices for one-period and two-period real bonds and a simple recursive formula for general |$k$|-period bonds, and prove that the price formula with appropriately specified parameters converges to that of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model (1985). In addition, I consider the behavior of nominal bond prices in a partial equilibrium setting in which an exogenous price level process is correlated with the real economy. Finally, I provide an illustrative empirical investigation of the model. The results indicate a significant correlation between the price level and the growth rate of consumption, which does not support the “money neutrality” assumption underlying Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross’s nominal bond prices and related empirical studies, such as Gibbons and Ramaswamy (1992), Heston (1991), and Pearson and Sun (1991).

## 4. Pricing Interest Rate Options in a Two-Factor Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model of the Term Structure
### Date
- 19 May 2015
### Author

- Louis Scott
### Abstract
Solutions are presented for prices on interest rate options in a two-factor version of the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model of the term structure. Specific solutions are developed for caps on floating interest rates and for European options on discount bonds, coupon bonds, coupon bond futures, and Euro-dollar futures. The solutions for the options are expressed as multivariate integrals, and we show how to reduce the calculations to univariate numerical integrations, which can be calculated very quickly. The two-factor model provides more flexibility in fitting observed term structures, and the fixed parameters of the model can be set to capture the variability of the term structure over time.

## 5. Systematic Risk, Hedging Pressure, and Risk Premiums in Futures Markets
### Date
- 19 May 2015
### Author
- Hendrik Bessembinder
### Abstract
I examine the uniformity of risk pricing in futures and asset markets. Tests against a general alternative do not reject complete integration of futures and asset markets. As predicted, estimates of the “zero-beta” rate for futures are close to zero, and premiums for systematic risk do not differ significantly across assets and futures. There is, however, evidence consistent with a specific alternative model presented by Hirshleifer (1988). Returns in foreign currency and agricultural futures vary with the net holdings of hedgers, after controlling for systematic risk. These results imply a degree of market segmentation and support hedging pressure as a determinant of futures premiums.

## 6. Equity Issues and Changes in Expectations of Earnings by Financial Analysts
### Date
- 19 May 2015
### Author
- Prem C. Jain
### Abstract
Evidence is provided on an implication of models by Myers and Majluf (1984) and Miller and Rock (1985), which predict that equity issues convey information aboutfirms’future earnings. Consistent with the prediction, the results show that earnings forecast revisions by financial analysts subsequent to the announcement of equity issues are significantly related to announcement period abnormal returns.

## 7. Repetition, Reputation, and Raiding
### Date
- 19 May 2015
### Author
- J. Chris Leach
### Abstract
I develop a multitarget takeover model with bid revisions, in which bidders desire a reputation for having low valuations. Such a reputation increases the likelihood that future targets will accept low premium bids. Bidders develop reputation by using low take-it-or-leave-it offers. Consequently, tender premiums, bid revision rates, and success rates are lower for continuing bidders than for those considering only a single target. Success rates vary within a series, and reputation building is more likely with highly correlated target valuations. I provide an exploratory empirical analysis consistent with lower premiums from continuing bidders and discuss some resulting implications regarding “raiders,” conglomerates, and resistance strategies.

## 8. Litigation Risk, Intermediation, and the Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings
### Date
- 19 May 2015
### Author

- Anjan V. Thakor
### Abstract
We formally examine the role of litigation risk in initial public offering (IPO) pricing. The underwriter’s pricing decision trades off current revenue against expected future litigation costs, both of which are increasing in the IPO price. Given a time-consistency constraint and rational expectations on the part of investors, however, the “standard” litigation risk argument does not lead to equilibrium underpricing. We develop a richer model that provides sufficient conditions under which there is equilibrium underpricing. The issuer’s choice of employing an underwriter versus floating the IPO on its own is examined, and various testable implications of the model are developed.
