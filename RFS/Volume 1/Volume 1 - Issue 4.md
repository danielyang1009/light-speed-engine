## 1. Capital Structure and Signaling Game Equilibria
### Date

### Author
- Thomas H. Noe
### Abstract
In this article we model the financing decisions of a firm as a sequential signaling game. We prove that, when insiders have perfect information regarding the firm's future cash flows, the application of “refinements” to the set of admissible equilibria leads to the dominance of debt over equity financing. However, we show that when insiders observe the firm's cash flows imperfectly, there may exist sequential equilibria in which this “pecking order” breaks down and some firms strictly prefer equity to debt financing. We also prove that, despite the breakdown of the pecking order, the announcement effect of equity financing will be negative relative to debt financing.

## 2. Market Trading Structures and Asset Pricing: Evidence from the Treasury-Bill Markets
### Date
- 14 March 2015
### Author
- Avraham Kamara
### Abstract
Earlier studies report significant price disparities between futures and forward or spot markets. Examining the Treasury-bill markets, this article demonstrates that differences in market trading structures explain these disparities. Treasury-bill futures rates contain significantly lower liquidity and default premia than do synthetic forward rates. This reflects the functioning of a futures' clearing association and differences between an open-outcry auction futures market and an over-the-counter dealer spot market. The same factors that make futures contracts nonredundant securities also explain the existence, in equilibrium, of price disparities.

## 3. Nonnegative Wealth, Absence of Arbitrage, and Feasible Consumption Plans
### Date
- 14 March 2015
### Author

### Abstract
A restriction to nonnegative wealth is sufficient to preclude all arbitrage opportunities in financial models that have no arbitrage in limits of simple strategies. Imposing nonnegative wealth does not constrain agents from making the choice they would make under the standard integrability condition. These conclusions do not depend on whether markets are complete.

## 4. Are Seasonal Anomalies Real? A Ninety-Year Perspective
### Date
- 14 March 2015
### Author
- Josef Lakonishok
- Seymour Smidt
### Abstract
This study uses 90 years of daily data on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to test for the existence of persistent seasonal patterns in the rates of return. Methodological issues regarding seasonality tests are considered. We find evidence of persistently anomalous returns around the turn of the week, around the turn of the month, around the turn of the year, and around holidays.

## 5. On Jump Processes in the Foreign Exchange and Stock Markets
### Date
- 14 March 2015
### Author
- Philippe Jorion
### Abstract
This article investigates the existence of discontinuities in the sample path of exchange rates and of a stock market index. Maximum-likelihood estimation of a mixed jump-diffusion process reveals that exchange rates exhibit systematic discontuinities, even after allowing for conditional heteroskedasticity in the diffusion process. The results are much more significant in the foreign exchange market than in the stock market, which suggests differences in the structure of these markets. Finally, this jump component is shown to explain some of the empirically observed mispricings in the currency options market.
