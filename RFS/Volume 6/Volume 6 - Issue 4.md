## 1. Auctions of Divisible Goods: On the Rationale for the Treasury Experiment

### Abstract
We compare a sealed-bid uniform-price auction (the Treasury’s experimental format) with a sealed-bid discriminatory auction (the Treasury’s format heretofore), assuming the good is perfectly divisible. We show that the auction theory that prompted the experiment, which assumes single-unit demands, does not adequately describe the bidding game for Treasury securities. Collusive strategies are self-enforcing in uniform-price divisible-good auctions. In these equilibria, the seller’s expected revenue is lower than in equilibria of discriminatory auctions.

## 2. The Rationality of Early Exercise Decisions: Evidence from the S&P 100 Index Options Market

### Abstract
This study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the early exercise history of S&P 100 put and call option. Even though the S&P 100 index option market is generally considered to be the most efficient options market in the world, we show that many exercise decisions are inefficient because they occur when recorded bids are greater than exercise values. Due to market imperfections, some of the cases of inefficient exercise are still rational, but we show that a substantial number of these decisions are clearly irrational since it would have been possible to realize a larger riskless net cash flow by selling. Unlike previous studies of early exercise, our tests of efficiency and the rational decisions that presumably lead to efficient markets are model independent. We also provide evidence concerning the relative significance of dividends and the wild card to index option pricing models, and introduce and document the importance of the option to exercise and avoid the indirect costs of the spread. We also find evidence of a significant day-of the-week exercise effect, and present some likely explanations for that effect.

## 3. Investment Analysis and the Adjustment of Stock Prices to Common Information

### Abstract
In this article we are concerned with the effect of the number of investment analysts following a firm on the speed of adjustment of the firm’s stock price to new information that has common effects across firms. It is found that returns on portfolios of firms that are followed by many analysts tend to lead those of firms that are followed by fewer analysts, even when the firms are of approximately the same size. Many analyst firms also tend to respond more rapidly to market returns than do few analyst firms, adjusting for firm size. This relation, however, is nonlinear, and the marginal effect of the number of analysts on the speed of price adjustment increases with the number of analysts.

## 4. Equilibrium and Options on Real Assets
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author
- Joseph T. Williams
### Abstract
In aggregate, options on real and financial assets can have very different properties. Typically, the good or service produced by a real asset has a finite elasticity of demand, and developers have finite capacities. Also, the supply of options can be limited, and developers can be less than perfectly competitive. In a subgame, perfect Nash equilibrium with these properties, the optimal exercise policy, and resulting values of developed and undeveloped assets are calculated explicitly. The novel comparative statics are discussed in detail.

## 5. The Dynamics of the Free-Rider Problem in Takeovers
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author

- Jacek Prokop
### Abstract
We explore the dynamics of a takeover bid. In contrast to preceding models, if the initial takeover bid is unsuccessful a raider is allowed to make a new tender offer in order to try and secure the remaining shares. Numerical analysis shows that the raider’s tender offer rises over time as he accumulates more shares. The anticipation of a higher tender offer in the future makes shareholders more inclined to hold their shares and forces the raider to offer a higher premium than is predicted by static theories. As the time between tender offers goes to zero, we show analytically that the expected profit from engaging in a takeover goes to zero.

## 6. Competing Bids, Target Management Resistance, and the Structure of Takeover Bids
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author

- Michael A. Mazzeo
### Abstract
We examine the structure of initial takeover bids and the frequency of observing competing bids and target management resistance. We find the use of cash is not consistently correlated with the frequency of competition or resistance and that the cost of acquiring information about a target is associated with the likelihood of competition and resistance. A high bid premium appears to deter competing offers and is also associated with a lower likelihood of resistance. Finally, target management resistance is associated with an increased likelihood of a competing offer arising and a larger increase in target shareholder wealth between the initial public announcement and outcome dates relative to the not-resisted subsample for both successful and unsuccessful acquisition proposals.

## 7. Payout Policy, Capital Structure, and Compensation Contracts when Managers Value Control
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author
- Chun Chang
### Abstract
The optimal contract between managers and investors is endogenously derived when managers have preferences for both monetary compensation and corporate resources under their control. When the optimal payout is privately known to managers, they can be induced to make payouts by linking their compensation to the payout. Public equity is a claim on this discretionary payout. If investors can obtain new information about the firm’s optimal payout level, it can be utilized by transferring the control from management to investors. The new information allows the firm to achieve a more efficient allocation through recontracting. We show that the new information will be obtained if and only if the payout falls below a promised level

## 8. Production Flexibility, Stochastic Separation, Hedging, and Futures Prices
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author
- Avraham Kamara
### Abstract
We study a dynamic model where uncertainty about interim output adjustments causes producers to face price, cost and output uncertainty. Stochastically separable production decisions are independent of the producer’s risk preferences and expectations and are based on the prevailing futures price as a certain output price. Conditions under which futures contracts achieve stochastic separation are established. Optimal hedging and maturity structure of futures contracts, equilibrium futures prices, and the effects of futures trading on output are studied. The systematic risk premium depends on the product of the futures beta and the covariance of the market return with production revenues.

## 9. Bondholder Losses in Leveraged Buyouts
### Date
- 25 May 2015
### Author

### Abstract
Announcements of successful leveraged buyouts (LBOs) during January 1985 to April 1989 caused a significantly negative return on outstanding publicly traded nonconvertible bonds. Yet the average risk-adjusted debt holder losses are less than 7 percent of the average risk-adjusted equity holder gains. Bond losses are related to the pre-LBO rating, but only weakly to equity holder gains. We demonstrate that trader-quoted data from a major investment bank offers conclusions about the effects of LBOs on debt holders different from those drawn from commonly used matrix and exchange-based data (such as Standard & Poor’s Bond Guide data). This has important implications for event studies involving debt instruments.
