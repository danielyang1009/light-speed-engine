## 1. Does It Pay to Pay Attention?
### Date

### Abstract
We employ a novel brokerage account data set to investigate which individual investors are the most attentive, how investors allocate their attention, and the relation between investor attention and performance. Attention is positively related to investment performance, at both the portfolio return level and the individual trades level. We provide evidence that the superior performance of high-attention investors arises because they purchase attention-grabbing stocks whose positive performance persists for up to six months. Finally, we show that paying attention is particularly profitable when trading stocks with high uncertainty, but for which a lot of public information is available.

## 2. Rent Seeking by Low-Latency Traders: Evidence from Trading on Macroeconomic Announcements
### Date

### Abstract
Prices of the highly liquid S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (SPY) and the E-mini future (ES) respond to macroeconomic announcement surprises within five milliseconds, with trading intensity increasing over 100-fold following the news release. However, profits from trading quickly are relatively small, roughly
$\$$
19,000 (⁠
$\$$
50,000) per event for SPY (ES). Although the speed of information incorporation has increased in recent years, profits have not. Order flow has become less informative, consistent with prices responding directly to news rather than indirectly through trading. Our evidence indicates that low-latency liquidity demanders do not benefit materially from short-term monopolistic access to information.

## 3. Active Fundamental Performance
### Date

### Abstract
We propose a new measure, active fundamental performance (AFP), to identify skilled mutual fund managers. AFP evaluates fund investment skills conditioned on the release of firms’ fundamental information. For each fund, we examine the covariance between deviations of its portfolio weights from a benchmark portfolio and the underlying stock performance on days when firms publicize fundamental information. Because asset prices on these information days better reflect firm fundamentals, AFP can more effectively identify investment skills. From 1984 to 2014, funds in the top decile of high AFP subsequently outperformed those in the bottom decile by 2% to 3% per year.

## 4. Skewness Consequences of Seeking Alpha
### Date
- 15 March 2018
### Author

### Abstract
Mutual funds seek alpha, but coskewness is also an important performance attribute. Coskewness of fund returns is associated with market timing, liquidity management, and derivative use. Measures of active management associated with positive alphas are also associated with undesirable coskewness. When controlling for other characteristics, coskewness is positively associated with activity measures related to market timing and negatively associated with activity measures related to stock picking. In the cross-section of funds, the latter effect dominates, so funds generate undesirable coskewness in the pursuit of alpha. Money flows to funds with desirable coskewness.

## 5. Risk, Unemployment, and the Stock Market: A Rare-Event-Based Explanation of Labor Market Volatility
### Date
- 31 January 2018
### Author
- Mete Kilic
- Jessica A Wachter
### Abstract
What is the driving force behind the cyclical behavior of unemployment and vacancies? What is the relation between firms’ job-creation incentives and stock market valuations? We answer these questions in a model with time-varying risk, modeled as a small and variable probability of an economic disaster. A high probability implies greater risk and lower future growth, lowering the incentives of firms to invest in hiring. During periods of high risk, stock market valuations are low and unemployment rises. The model thus explains volatility in equity and labor markets, and the relation between the two.

## 6. Can People Learn about ‘Black Swans’? Experimental Evidence
### Date
- 06 April 2018
### Author
- Elise Payzan-LeNestour
### Abstract
How do people cope with tail risk? In a lab experiment that removed informational and incentive confounds, subjects overwhelmingly behaved like Bayesian learners. The results of simulations further revealed that if one is to survive under tail risk, one needs to follow the Bayesian approach, as all boundedly rational alternatives fail. These findings support the Bayesian assumption commonly made in prior studies on tail risk and model uncertainty, and they also demonstrate the importance of optimal learning under tail risk.

## 7. Long Forward Probabilities, Recovery, and the Term Structure of Bond Risk Premiums
### Date
- 06 April 2018
### Author

### Abstract
This paper examines the assumption of transition independence of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) in the bond market. This assumption underlies the recovery result of Ross 2015. Following the methodology of Alvarez and Jermann 2005 and Hansen and Scheinkman 2009, we estimate the martingale component in the long-term factorization of the SDF using U.S. Treasury data. The empirically estimated martingale component is highly volatile and produces a downward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. In contrast, the transition independence assumption implies a degenerate martingale component and an upward-sloping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Thus, transition independence is inconsistent with our empirical results.

## 8. Mortgage Supply and Housing Rents
### Date
- 14 February 2018
### Author

- Michael Reher
### Abstract
We show that a contraction of mortgage supply after the Great Recession has increased housing rents. Our empirical strategy exploits heterogeneity in MSAs’ exposure to regulatory shocks experienced by lenders over the 2010–2014 period. Tighter lending standards have increased demand for rental housing, leading to higher rents, depressed homeownership rates and an increase in rental supply. Absent the credit supply contraction, annual rent growth would have been 2.1 percentage points lower over 2010–2014 in MSAs in which lending standards rose from their 2008 levels.

## 9. Got Rejected? Real Effects of Not Getting a Loan
### Date
- 05 April 2018
### Author
- Tobias Berg
### Abstract
Using a lender cutoff rule that generates plausibly exogenous variation in credit supply, I investigate a new channel through which funding shocks are transmitted to the real economy. Based on a sample of more than 15,000 loan applications from small- and medium-sized enterprises, I find that precautionary savings motives can aggravate real effects: low-liquidity firms whose loan applications were rejected increase cash holdings and cut noncash assets in excess of the requested loan amount. These results point to the amplifying effect of precautionary savings motives in the transmission of credit supply shocks.

## 10. Capital Inflows, Sovereign Debt and Bank Lending: Micro-Evidence from an Emerging Market
### Date
- 07 March 2018
### Author
- Tomas Williams
### Abstract
This paper uses a natural experiment to show that government access to foreign credit increases private access to credit. I identify a sudden, and unanticipated increase in capital inflows to the sovereign debt market in Colombia, due to a rebalancing in a government bond index by J.P. Morgan. I find that market makers banks in the treasury market reduced their sovereign debt by 7.8 percentage points of assets and increased their credit availability by 4.2 percentage points of assets. Using industry level data, I show that a higher exposure to market makers led to a higher growth in economic activity.
