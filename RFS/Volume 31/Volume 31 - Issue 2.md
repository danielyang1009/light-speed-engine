## 1. Robust Bond Risk Premia
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
A consensus has recently emerged that variables beyond the level, slope, and curvature of the yield curve can help predict bond returns. This paper shows that the statistical tests underlying this evidence are subject to serious small-sample distortions. We propose more robust tests, including a novel bootstrap procedure specifically designed to test the spanning hypothesis. We revisit the analysis in six published studies and find that the evidence against the spanning hypothesis is much weaker than it originally appeared. Our results pose a serious challenge to the prevailing consensus.

## 2. Structural GARCH: The Volatility-Leverage Connection
### Date
- 12 September 2017
### Author
- Robert F. Engle
- Emil N. Siriwardane
### Abstract
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, institutions have been asked to reduce leverage in order to reduce risk. To address the effectiveness of this measure, we build a model of equity volatility that accounts for leverage. Our approach blends Merton’s insights on capital structure with traditional time-series models of volatility. We estimate that precautionary capital needs for the entire financial sector reached $2 trillion during the crisis. We also investigate the long-standing observation that equity volatility asymmetrically responds to positive and negative news. Volatility asymmetry is mostly explained by exposure to the aggregate market, not a mechanical leverage effect.

## 3. Pricing Kernel Monotonicity and Conditional Information
### Date
- 21 August 2017
### Author
- Matthew Linn
- Sophie Shive
- Tyler Shumway
### Abstract
A large literature finds evidence that pricing kernels nonparametrically estimated from option prices and historical returns are not monotonically decreasing in market index returns. We argue that existing estimation methods are inconsistent and propose a new nonparametric estimator of the pricing kernel that reflects the information available to investors who set asset prices. In simulations, the estimator outperforms existing techniques. Our empirical estimates using S&P 500 index option data from 1996 to 2014 and FTSE 100 index option data from 2002 to 2014 suggest that the “pricing kernel puzzle” is due to flaws in existing estimators rather than a behavioral or economic phenomenon.

## 4. A Recovery that We Can Trust? Deducing and Testing the Restrictions of the Recovery Theorem
### Date
- 25 September 2017

### Abstract
How reliable is the recovery theorem of Ross (2015)? We explore this question in the context of options on the 30-year Treasury bond futures, allowing us to deduce restrictions that link the physical and risk-neutral return distributions. Our empirical results undermine the implications of the recovery theorem. First, we reject an implicit assumption of the recovery theorem that the martingale component of the stochastic discount factor is identical to unity. Second, we consider the restrictions between the physical and risk-neutral return moments when the recovery theorem holds, and reject them in both forecasting regressions and generalized method of moments estimations.

## 5. Are Stocks Riskier over the Long Run? Taking Cues from Economic Theory
### Date
- 14 July 2017
### Author
- Doron Avramov
- Scott Cederburg
- Katarína Lučivjanská
### Abstract
We study whether stocks are riskier or safer in the long run from the perspective of Bayesian investors who employ the long-run risk, habit formation, or prospect theory models to form prior beliefs about return dynamics. Economic theory delivers important guidance for long-run investment opportunities. Specifically, incorporating prior information from the habit formation or prospect theory models reinforces beliefs in mean reversion and inferences that stocks are safer over longer horizons. Conversely, investors with long-run risk priors perceive weaker mean reversion and riskier equities. Model-based information is particularly important for inferences about uncertainty in the dividend growth component of returns.

## 6. The Factor Structure in Equity Options
### Date
- 02 August 2017
### Author
- Peter Christoffersen
- Mathieu Fournier
- Kris Jacobs
### Abstract
Equity options display a strong factor structure. The first principal components of the equity volatility levels, skews, and term structures explain a substantial fraction of the cross-sectional variation. Furthermore, these principal components are highly correlated with the S&P 500 index option volatility, skew, and term structure, respectively. We develop an equity option valuation model that captures this factor structure. The model predicts that firms with higher market betas have higher implied volatilities, steeper moneyness slopes, and a term structure that covaries more with the market. The model provides a good fit, and the equity option data support the model’s cross-sectional implications.

## 7. Cross-Subsidization in Institutional Asset Management Firms
### Date
- 18 July 2017
### Author

- Charles Trzcinka
### Abstract
We study cross-subsidization among U.S. equity products managed by institutional asset management firms. We find returns-based evidence consistent with both cross-subsidization receipt by strong recent performers that are relatively small in their firms and provision by products that are relatively large in their firms. Tax-exempt investors and taxable investors do not have a clear ranking by expertise, but tax-exempt investors’ agency issues are more complex. Accordingly, taxable clients have more flow-performance nonlinearity and receive more (and provide less) cross-subsidization. Taxable investor flows appear more discerning, but only under the circumstances conducive to cross-subsidization, suggesting that “more discerning” likely means “more cross-subsidized.”

## 8. Forecasting through the Rearview Mirror: Data Revisions and Bond Return Predictability
### Date
- 22 August 2017
### Author
- Eric Ghysels
- Casidhe Horan
- Emanuel Moench
### Abstract
A previous literature has documented that bond returns are predicted by macroeconomic information not contained in yields contemporaneously. That literature has mostly relied on final revised, rather than real time macroeconomic data. We show that the use of real time data substantially reduces the predictive power of macro variables for future bond returns as well as the implied countercyclicality of term premiums. We discuss potential interpretations of our results.

## 9. Are Mutual Fund Managers Paid for Investment Skill?
### Date
- 11 September 2017
### Author

### Abstract
Compensation of mutual fund managers is paramount to understanding agency frictions in asset delegation. We collect a unique registry-based dataset on the compensation of Swedish mutual fund managers. We find a concave relationship between pay and revenue, in contrast to how investors compensate the fund company (firm). We also find a surprisingly weak sensitivity of pay to performance, even after accounting for the indirect effects of performance on revenue. Firm-level fixed effects, revenues, and profits add substantial explanatory power for compensation.

## 10. Open-End Organizational Structures and Limits to Arbitrage
### Date
- 10 July 2017
### Author
- Mariassunta Giannetti
- Bige Kahraman
### Abstract
We provide evidence that open-end organizational structures undermine incentives for asset managers to attack long-term mispricing. We compare open-end funds with closed-end funds. Closed-end funds purchase more underpriced stocks than do open-end funds, especially if the stocks involve high arbitrage risk. We then show that hedge funds with highshare restrictions having a lower degree of open-endedness also trade against long-term mispricing to a larger extentthan do other hedge funds. Our analysis suggests that open-end organizational structures are not conducive to long-term risky arbitrage.
