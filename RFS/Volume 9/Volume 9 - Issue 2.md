## 1. A New Dividend Forecasting Procedure that Rejects Bubbles in Asset Prices: The Case of 1929’s Stock Crash
### Date

### Abstract
We develop a new procedure to forecast future cash flows from a financial asset and then use the present value of our cash flow forecasts to calculate the asset’s fundamental price. As an example, we construct a nonlinear ARMA-ARCH-Artificial Neural Network model to obtain out-of-sample dividend forecasts for 1920 and beyond, using only in-sample dividend data. The present value of our forecasted dividends yield fundamental prices that reproduce the magnitude, timing, and time-series behavior of the boom and crash in 1929 stock prices. We therefore reject the popular claim that the 1920s stock market contained a bubble.

## 2. Testing Continuous-Time Models of the Spot Interest Rate
### Date

### Abstract
Different continuous-time models for interest rates coexist in the literature. We test parametric models by comparing their implied parametric density to the same density estimated nonparametrically. We do not replace the continuous-time model by discrete approximations, even though the data are recorded at discrete intervals. The principal source of rejection of existing models is the strong non-linearity of the drift. Around its mean, where the drift is essentially zero, the spot rate behaves like a random walk. The drift then mean-reverts strongly when far away from the mean. The volatility is higher when away from the mean.

## 3. The Time Variation of Risk and Return in Foreign Exchange Markets: A General Equilibrium Perspective
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Geert Bekaert
### Abstract
This article successively introduces variable velocity, durability, and habit persistence in a standard two-country general equilibrium model and explores their effects on the variability of exchange rate changes, forward premiums, and the foreign exchange risk premium. A new feature of the model is that agents make decisions at a weekly frequency and face conditionally heteroskedastic shocks. Nevertheless, even the most complex model fails to deliver sufficiently variable risk premiums without causing forward premiums and exchange rates to be excessively variable. Unlike previous models, the model can roughly match the persistence of forward premiums.

## 4. Trading Volume with Private Valuation: Evidence from The Ex-Dividend Day
### Date

### Abstract
We test a theory of the interaction between investors’ heterogeneity, risk, transaction costs, and trading volume. We take advantage of the specific nature of trading motives around the distribution of cash dividends, namely the costly trading of tax shields. Consistent with the theory, we show that when trades occur because of differential valuation of cash flows, an increase in risk or transaction costs reduces volume. We also show that the nonsystematic risk plays a significant role in determining the volume of trade. Finally, we demonstrate that trading volume is positively related to the degree of heterogeneity and the incentives of the various groups to engage in trading.

## 5. Portfolio Performance Measurement: Theory and Applications
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author

- Peter J. Knez
### Abstract
Any admissible portfolio performance measure should satisfy four minimal conditions: it assigns zero performance to each reference portfolio and it is linear, continuous, and nontrivial. Such an admissible measure exists if and only if the securities market obeys the law of one price. A positive admissible measure exists if and only if there is no arbitrage. This article characterizes the (infinite) set of admissible performance measures. It is shown that performance evaluation is generally quite arbitrary. A mutual fund data set is also used to demonstrate how the measurement method developed here can be applied.

## 6. Measuring the Pricing Error of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author

### Abstract
This article provides an exact Bayesian framework for analyzing the arbitrage pricing theory (APT). Based on the Gibbs sampler, we show how to obtain the exact posterior distributions for functions of interest in the factor model. In particular, we propose a measure of the APT pricing deviations and obtain its exact posterior distribution. Using monthly portfolio returns grouped by industry and market capitalization, we find that there is little improvement in reducing the pricing errors by including more factors beyond the first one.

## 7. Time-Series Implications of Aggregate Dividend Behavior
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Bong-Soo Lee
### Abstract
This article investigates the hypothesis that dividend changes are determined by changes in some measure of permanent earnings. The analysis employs two measures of permanent earnings and takes into account the nonstationarity of dividend and earnings series. This study finds that dynamic dividend behavior is accounted for primarily by changes in permanent earnings. dividends respond strongly to permanent changes in earnings without any significant overreaction, whereas they respond little, if at all, to transitory changes in earnings. The findings also suggest that the partial adjustment hypothesis, which assumes managers partially adjust dividends to a target dividend, performs better when the target dividend level is proportional to permanent earnings than when it is proportional to current earnings.

## 8. U.K. and U.S. Trading of British Cross-Listed Stocks: An Intraday Analysis of Market Integration
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Ingrid M. Werner
- Allan W. Kleidon
### Abstract
This article analyzes intraday patterns for U.K. and U.S. trading of British cross-listed stocks. For each market, the intraday patterns for these stocks closely resemble those of otherwise similar, non-cross-listed stocks. There is a 2-hour period each day when cross-listed stocks are traded both in New York and in London. This overlap is characterized by concentrated trading as private information, originating in New York, gets incorporated into prices in both markets. Cross-border competition for orderflow tends to reduce already declining spreads in London. By contrast, New York specialists maintain high spreads during the overlap. Overall, the evidence indicates that order flow for cross-listed securities is segmented.

## 9. The Strategic Timing of Corporate Disclosures
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Gerard Gennotte
- Brett Trueman
### Abstract
An important element of a firm’s disclosure strategy is the timing of its mandatory public announcements. In this article, two aspects of disclosure timing are examined. The first is the intraday timing of earnings announcements. It is demonstrated here that, under reasonable conditions, market prices reflect better the valuation implications of an earnings announcement when it is made during trading hours rather than after the market has closed. This implies that managers should prefer to release earnings with positive (negative) implications for firm value during (after) trading hours. The second issue examined is the sequencing of multiple corporate disclosures. It is shown that if the announcements have positive (negative) implications for firm value, managers should prefer to make them separately (simultaneously), as market prices better reflect the valuation implications of multiple announcements when they are made at different times.

## 10. Risk Aversion, Liquidity, and Endogenous Short Horizons
### Date

### Abstract
We analyze a competitive model in which different information signals get reflected in value at different points in time. If investors are sufficiently risk averse, we obtain an equilibrium in which all investors focus exclusively on the short term. In addition, we show that increasing the variance of informationless trading increases market depth but causes a greater proportion of investors to focus on the short-term signal, which decreases the informativeness of prices about the long run. Finally, we also explore parameter spaces under which long-term informed agents wish to voluntarily disclose their information.
