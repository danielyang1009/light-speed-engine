## 1. Heterogeneous Beliefs and the Effect of Replicatable Options on Asset Prices

### Abstract
We present two ways in which trading in a replicatable option can affect the price process of the underlying asset. In the first situation, trading an option that each investor views as pay off redundant breaks a non-fully revealing equilibrium that exists when the option market is absent. The second situation involves a market that is dynamically complete without options, but in which introducing an option market allows self-confirming conjectures of additional uncertainty about the future price of the underlying asset. Heterogeneous beliefs play important though different roles in both situations.

## 2. Collusion in Uniform-Price Auctions: Experimental Evidence and Implications for Treasury Auctions

### Abstract
We provide experimental evidence that nonbinding preplay communication between bidders in auctions of shares facilitates the adoption of equilibrium strategies: collusive strategies in uniform-price auctions, and the unique equilibrium in undominated strategies in discriminatory auctions. When communication between bidders is introduced, clearing prices and auctioneer profits in uniform-price auctions fall below those observed in discriminatory auctions. This evidence suggests that uniform-price auctions of Treasury securities may result in lower revenues than the currently employed discriminatory procedure.

## 3. The Role of Investment Banks in Acquisitions
### Date

### Abstract
We compare acquisitions completed with and without investment bank advice over the 1981 to 1992 period. We find that the choice to use an investment bank depends on the complexity of the transaction, the type of transaction (takeovers versus acquisitions of assets), the acquiror’s prior acquisition experience, and the degree of diversification of the target firm. Although acquisition announcement returns are lower for firms using investment banks, this difference can be explained by differences in transaction characteristics. These results suggest that transaction costs are the main determinant of investment banking choice, followed by contracting costs and asymmetric information costs.

## 4. Mortgage Valuation Under Optimal Prepayment
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Stephen F. LeRoy
### Abstract
Mortgage originators offer borrowers various combinations of “points”—loan fees—and coupon: high points and low coupon or low points and high coupon. In this article points are interpreted as a device serving to separate borrowers with high prepayment probabilities from those with low prepayment probabilities. Borrowers and lenders are treated symmetrically: both are risk neutral and both have complete and frictionless access to credit markets (implying that borrowers can finance points if they wish), except that borrowers’ prepayment speeds are private knowledge. Equilibria are derived, both when borrowers cannot prepay voluntarily and when they can.

## 5. Time-Varying Expected Small Firm Returns and Closed-End Fund Discounts
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Bhaskaran Swaminathan
### Abstract
This article describes the relation between closed-end fund discounts and time-varying expected excess returns on small firms. The results indicate that closed-end fund discounts forecast future excess returns on small firms. The information in discounts is independent of that in other commonly used forecasting variables such as the dividend yield on the market, the default spread, and the term spread. Furthermore, the closed-end fund discount forecasts only the small firm factor return and is the only variable that forecasts the small firm factor return. Additional tests indicate that the information in discounts is related to expectations of future earnings growth and expectations of future inflation. These results provide significant support for a rational explanation of the time-series relationship between discounts and expected returns on small firms.

## 6. Bank Equity Stakes in Borrowing Firms and Financial Distress
### Date

### Abstract
We derive the optimal financial claim for a bank when the borrowing firm’s uninformed stakeholders depend on the bank to establish whether the firm is distressed and whether concessions by stakeholders are necessary. The bank’s financial claim is designed to ensure that it cannot collude with a healthy firm’s owners to seek unnecessary concessions or to collude with a distressed firm’s owners to claim that the firm is healthy. To prove that a request for concessions has not come from a healthy firm/bank coalition, the bank must hold either a very small or a very large equity stake when the firm enters distress. To prove that a distressed firm and the bank have not colluded to claim that the firm is healthy, the bank may need to hold equity under routine financial conditions.

## 7. The Optimal Trading and Pricing of Securities with Asymmetric Capital Gains Taxes and Transaction Costs
### Date

### Author

- Chester S. Spatt
### Abstract
This article explores the optimal trading and pricing of taxable securities with asymmetric capital gains taxes and transaction costs. In the long-term region, investors realize all gains below some critical cutoff level, which we derive analytically. In the short-term region, investors defer all gains and, depending upon the time remaining in the short-term region, may also defer small losses. Contrary to common intuition, deferral of short-term losses can be optimal even without transaction costs. The value of tax timing is considerably higher under the optimal trading strategy than under alternative strategies previously analyzed. The impact of offset rules is also explored.

## 8. Life in the Pits: Competitive Market Making and Inventory Control
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
We use futures transaction data to investigate cross-sectional relationships between market-maker inventory positions and trade activity. The investigation documents strongly that traders control inventory throughout the trading day. Despite this evidence of inventory management, typical inventory control models are contradicted by our data. These inventory models predict that market-maker reservation prices are negatively influenced by inventory. Surprisingly, our evidence shows, as a strong and consistent empirical regularity, that correlations between inventory and reservation prices are positive. We interpret the evidence as consistent with active position taking by futures market floor traders.

## 9. Large Option Trades, Market Makers, and Limit Orders
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Henk Berkman
### Abstract
This article focuses on the difference between market makers and limit orders in their role as suppliers of liquidity. For both sources of liquidity I analyze the price behavior of stocks and options around large option trades and I estimate the premium paid by the initiator of the large trade. My findings suggest that limit orders for options are “picked off” after adverse changes in the underlying stock price. Furthermore, I find that for these transactions there is a permanent change in quotations in the direction of the transaction. After transactions where market makers supply liquidity, quotes tend to return to their pretrade level.

## 10. Dynamic Banking: A Reconsideration
### Date

### Abstract
Financially intermediated and stock market consumption-investment allocations, with and without governmental interventions, are compared in a welfare sense in overlapping generation economies with (and without) shocks to agents’ intertemporal preferences. We first show that, in economies with preference shocks, governmental interventions subject to the same information requirements as those imposed on financial intermediaries, lead to stock market allocations that are not inferior to those attained under financial intermediation. Second, we argue that the necessary interventions are qualitatively no different from those required to implement stationary optimal allocations in OLG models without shocks to agents’ intertemporal consumption preferences.
