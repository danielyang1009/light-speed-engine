## 1. Temporary Components of Stock Returns: What Do the Data Tell Us?

### Abstract
Within the past few years several articles have suggested that returns on large equity portfolios may contain a significant predictable component at horizons 3 to 6 years. Subsequently, the tests used in these analyses have been criticized (appropriately) for having widely misunderstood size and power, rendering the conclusions inappropriate. This criticism however has not focused on the data, it addressed the properties of the tests. In this article we adopt a subjectivist analysis – treating the data as fixed – to ascertain whether the data have anything to say about the permanent/temporary decomposition. The data speak clearly and they tell us that for all intents and purposes, stock prices follow a random walk.

## 2. Does the Japanese Governance System Enhance Shareholder Wealth? Evidence from the Stock-Price Effects of Top Management Turnover

### Abstract
This article examines the stock-price effects of top management turnover announcements for 432 Japanese corporations from 1985 to 1990. We find that these announcements are associated with significantly positive abnormal returns. The returns are greater when turnover is forced than when turnover represents normal succession. The stock-price effects are also significantly positive when turnover is forced and the successor is appointed from outside the firm. We find that large shareholders play an important role during outside succession. This evidence suggests that the disciplinary decisions of Japanese governance mechanisms are consistent with shareholder wealth maximization.

## 3. Survivor Bias and Mutual Fund Performance

### Abstract
Mutual fund attrition can create problems for a researcher because funds that disappear tend to do so due to poor performance. In this article we estimate the size of the bias by tracking all funds that existed at the end of 1976. When a fund merges we calculate the return, taking into account the merger terms. This allows a precise estimate of survivorship bias. In addition, we examine characteristics of both mutual funds that merge and their partner funds. Estimates of survivorship bias over different horizons and using different models to evaluate performance are provided.

## 4. Estimating the profits from trading strategies
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author

### Abstract
Price improvement is the difference between the execution price of an order and the quoted bid or ask when the order was submitted. We show that expected price improvement falls off dramatically as the size of the order approaches the quoted depth, and becomes negative for larger orders. This is particularly important for small firms because the quoted depths are low. Using quoted spreads and depths and our estimate of expected price improvement, we show that trading strategies that attempt to exploit the weekly predictability of small-firm returns would be swamped by transaction costs.

## 5. Control Rights, Debt Structure, and the Loss of Private Benefits: The Case of the UK Insolvency Code
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Julian R. Franks
- Kjell G. Nyborg
### Abstract
We show how the efficiency of reorganization is affected by the distribution of control rights under the U.K. insolvency code. Control rights raise particular problems when creditors have different incentives to keep the firm as a going concern. Such differences may arise from the possession of private benefits by particular creditors which are lost if the debtor firm is liquidated. The incidence of inefficient liquidations is influenced by the size and seniority of creditors’ claims. The current U.K. code is widely thought to give rise to inefficient liquidations. We show, however, that inefficiency depends upon the debt structure and whether the controlling creditor in formal bankruptcy has private benefits.

## 6. American Option Valuation: New Bounds, Approximations, and a Comparison of Existing Methods
### Date

### Author
- Mark Broadie
- Jerome Detemple
### Abstract
We develop lower and upper bounds on the prices of American call and put options written on a dividend-paying asset. We provide two option price approximations, one based on the lower bound (termed LBA) and one based on both bounds (termed LUBA). The LUBA approximation has an average accuracy comparable to a 1,000-step binomial tree with a computation speed comparable to a 50-step binomial tree. We introduce a modification of the binomial method (termed BBSR) that is very simple to implement and performs remarkably well. We also conduct a careful large-scale evaluation of many recent methods for computing American option prices.

## 7. Testing for Deliberate Underpricing in the IPO Premarket: A Stochastic Frontier Approach
### Date

### Author

- Bill B. Francis
### Abstract
We reevaluate the IPO underpricing phenomenon using the stochastic frontier methodology. The advantage of the stochastic frontier is that it can be used to measure the level of deliberate underpricing in the premarket without using after-market information. This is accomplished through the estimation of a systematic one-sided error term that measures “inefficiency” or the difference between the maximum predicted offer price and the actual offer price. Data for the analysis are comprised of 1,035 IPOs of common stock issued by firm commitment between 1975 and 1984. IPOs appear to be deliberately underpriced in the premarket in both hot-market and nonhot-market periods. Moreover, the determinants of the maximum IPO price have different effects in the two time periods.
