## 1. Agency and Brokerage of Real Assets in Competitive Equilibrium

### Abstract
Brokerage contracts for many categories of real assets are characterized by a common, constant commission rate payable upon sale, exclusive agency, and contractual asking prices. For a large market in steady state, these conventional contracts produce in equilibrium no agency problem between a broker and his clients. Each broker spends the same time or effort selling each client's asset as the broker would spend on his own assets. As in standard agency problems, extra effort by a broker generates first-order stochastically dominant distributions of bids by potential buyers. Unlike standard agency problems, each broker can allocate his time or effort between selling the assets of his multiple clients and searching for new clients in competition with other brokers. Because brokers' time spent searching for new sellers is dissipative, entry by brokers is excessive in equilibrium.

## 2. Default Risk Cannot Explain the Muni Puzzle: Evidence from Municipal Bonds that are Secured by U.S. Treasury Obligations
### Date

### Abstract
Fama (1977) and Miller (1977) predict that one minus the corporate tax rate will equate after tax yields from comparable taxable and tax-exempt bonds. Empirical evidence shows that long-term tax-exempt yields are higher than theory predicts. Two popular explanations for this empirical puzzle are that, relative to taxable bonds, municipal bonds bear more default risk and include costly call options. I study U.S. government secured municipal bond yields which are effectively default-free and noncallable. These municipal yields display the same tendency to be too high. I conclude that differential default risk and call options do not explain the municipal bond puzzle.

## 3. An Equilibrium Model with Restricted Stock Market Participation

### Abstract
This article solves the equilibrium problem in a pure-exchange, continuous-time economy in which some agents face information costs or other types of frictions effectively preventing them from investing in the stock market. Under the assumption that the restricted agents have logarithmic utilities, a complete characterization of equilibrium prices and consumption/investment policies is provided. A simple calibration shows that the model can help resolve some of the empirical asset pricing puzzles.

## 4. The Restrictions on Predictability Implied by Rational Asset Pricing Models
### Date
- 03 June 2015
### Author
- Chris Kirby
### Abstract
This article shows how rational asset pricing models restrict the regression-based criteria commonly used to measure return predictability. Specifically it invokes no-arbitrage arguments to show that the intercept, slope coefficients, and |$R^2$| in predictive regressions must take specific values. These restrictions provide a way to directly assess whether the predictability uncovered using regression analysis is consistent with rational pricing. Empirical tests reveal that the returns on the CRSP size deciles are too predictable to be compatible with a number of well-known pricing models. However, the overall pattern of predictability across these portfolios is reasonably consistent with what we would expect under circumstances where predictability is rational.

## 5. Optimal Financial Contracting: Debt versus Outside Equity
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
This article presents a theory of outside equity based on the control rights and the maturity design of equity. I show that outside equity is a tacit agreement between investors and management supported by the equity-holders' right to dismiss management regardless of performance and by the lack of a prespecified expiration date on equity. As a tacit agreement outside equity is sustainable despite management's potential for manipulating the cash flows and regardless of how costly it is for equity holders to establish a case against managerial wrongdoing. I establish that the only outside equity that investors are willing to hold in equilibrium is that with unlimited life, the very outside equity that corporations issue. Consistent with empirical evidence, this model predicts that debt-equity ratios are higher (lower) in industries with low (high) cash flow variability

## 6. Stock Price Volatility in a Multiple Security Overlapping Generations Model
### Date

### Author
- Matthew Spiegel
### Abstract
A number of empirical studies have reached the conclusion that stock price volatility cannot be fully explained within the standard dividend discount model. This article proposes a resolution based upon a model that contains both a random supply of risky assets and finitely lived agents who trade in a multiple security environment. As the analysis shows there exist |$2^K$| equilibria when K securities trade. The low volatility equilibria have properties analogous to those found in the infinitely lived agent models of Campbell and Kyle (1991) and Wang (1993, 1994). In contrast, the high-volatility equilibria have very different characteristics. Within the high-volatility equilibria very large price variances can be generated with very small supply shocks. Adding securities to the economy further reduces the required supply shocks. Using previously established empirical results the model can reconcile the data with supply shocks that are less than 10% as large as observed return shocks. These results are shown to hold even when the dividend process is mean reverting.
