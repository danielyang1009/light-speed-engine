## 1. The Performance of Japanese Mutual Funds

### Abstract
We analyze the performance of Japanese open-type stock mutual funds for the 1981–1992 period. The results show that, regardless of the performance measures and benchmarks employed, most of the Japanese mutual funds underperform the benchmarks by between 3.6% and 10.8% per annum. These funds tend to invest more in large stocks with low book-to-market ratios. But this feature does not explain the underperformance. A potential explanation is the dilution effect caused by inflows of funds. In Japan, a new investor of an open-type fund only pays in the after-tax value of the net asset value. We conduct a bootstrap experiment to assess the magnitude of this dilution effect.

## 2. Empirical Characteristics of Dynamic Trading Strategies: The Case of Hedge Funds
### Date

### Abstract
This article presents some new results on an unexplored dataset on hedge fund performance. The results indicate that hedge funds follow strategies that are dramatically different from mutual funds, and support the claim that these strategies are highly dynamic. The article finds five dominant investment styles in hedge funds, which when added to Sharpe’s (1992) asset class factor model can provide an integrated framework for style analysis of both buy-and-hold and dynamic trading strategies.

## 3. Initial Margin Policy and Stochastic Volatility in the Crude Oil Futures Market
### Date

### Abstract
This article examines the relationship between the volatility of the crude oil futures market and changes in initial margin requirements. To closely match changes in futures market volatility with the corresponding changes in margin requirements, we infer the volatility of the futures market from the prices of crude oil futures options contracts. Using a mean-reverting diffusion process for volatility, we show that changes in margin policy do not affect subsequent market volatility.

## 4. Inferring Future Volatility from the Information in Implied Volatility in Eurodollar Options: A New Approach
### Date

### Abstract
We study the information content of implied volatility from several volatility specifications of the Heath–Jarrow–Morton (1992) (HJM) models relative to popular historical volatility models in the Eurodollar options market. The implied volatility from the HJM models explains much of the variation of realized interest rate volatility over both daily and monthly horizons. The implied volatility dominates the GARCH terms, the Glosten et al. (1993) type asymmetric volatility terms, and the interest rate level. However, it cannot explain that the impact of interest rate shocks on the volatility is lower when interest rates are low than when they are high.

## 5. An Exploration of the Forward Premium Puzzle in Currency Markets
### Date
- 04 June 2015
### Author
- Ravi Bansal
### Abstract
A standard empirical finding is that expected changes in exchange rates and interest rate differentials across countries are negatively related, implying that uncovered interest rate parity is violated in the data. This article provides new empirical evidence that suggests that violations of uncovered interest rate parity, and its economic implications, depend on the sign of the interest rate differential. A framework related to term structure models is developed to account for the puzzling relationship between expected changes in exchange rates and interest rate differentials. Estimation results suggest that a particular term structure model can account for the puzzling empirical evidence.

## 6. Pricing Mortgage-Backed Securities in a Multifactor Interest Rate Environment: A Multivariate Density Estimation Approach
### Date

### Abstract
Multivariate density estimation (MDE) suggests that mortgage-backed security (MBS) prices can be well described as a function of the level and slope of the term structure. We analyze how this function varies across MBSs with different coupons. An important finding is that the interest rate level proxies for the moneyness of the option, the expected level of prepayments, and the average life of the cash flows, while the term structure slope controls for the average rate at which these cash flows should be discounted. Though the origination and prepayment behavior of mortgages differ substantially across coupons, there remains an unexplained common factor in MBS prices. This factor does not seem to be related to the usual suspects and therefore presents a puzzle to financial economists.

## 7. The Valuation of Nonsystematic Risks and the Pricing of Swedish Lottery Bonds
### Date

- Kristian Rydqvist
### Abstract
Swedish government lottery bonds have coupon payments determined by lottery. They offer a unique opportunity to study a security with uncertain payoffs having a known, observable distribution. The risk associated with the lotteries is idiosyncratic by construction and should not command a risk premium in equilibrium. The bonds are traded in two forms, allowing us to evaluate the rewards to bearing extra lottery risk. Despite its idiosyncratic nature, we find prices appear to reflect aversion to this risk. We evaluate the empirical determinants of this differential pricing and possible explanations for it.

## 8. A Markov Model for the Term Structure of Credit Risk Spreads
### Date
- 04 June 2015
### Author

- David Lando
- Stuart M. Turnbull
### Abstract
This article provides a Markov model for the term structure of credit risk spreads. The model is based on Jarrow and Turnbull (1995), with the bankruptcy process following a discrete state space Markov chain in credit ratings. The parameters of this process are easily estimated using observable data. This model is useful for pricing and hedging corporate debt with imbedded options, for pricing and hedging OTC derivatives with counterparty risk, for pricing and hedging (foreign) government bonds subject to default risk (e.g., municipal bonds), for pricing and hedging credit derivatives, and for risk management.
