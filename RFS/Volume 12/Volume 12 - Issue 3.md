## 1. Hedging Long-Term Exposures with Multiple Short-Term Futures Contracts
### Date

### Author
- Anthony Neuberger
### Abstract
This article analyzes the problem facing an agent who has a long-term commodity supply commitment and who wishes to hedge that commitment using short-maturity commodity futures contracts. As time evolves, the agent has to roll the hedge as old futures contracts mature and new futures contracts are listed. This gives rise to hedge errors. The optimal hedging strategy is characterized in a world where contracts of several different maturities coexist. The strategy is independent both of the agent's risk aversion and, under certain conditions, of beliefs about expected returns from holding futures contracts. The methodology is compared with approaches based on dynamic models of the term structure. It is tested on data from the oil futures market.

## 2. Risk Spillovers and Required Returns in Capital Budgeting
### Date

### Abstract
This article integrates strategic product market analysis with price-taking asset pricing theory. We demonstrate that a firm's market power can lead to scale-dependent and potentially infinite required returns. Scale dependency, which we relate to risk spillovers between expansionary and existing cash flows, reflects the divergence of incremental from existing required returns. The firm-specific nature of risk spillovers potentially destroys the concept of a common industry “risk class”. Our analysis raises important questions regarding the validity of widely used “comparables” methods for determining risk-adjusted discount rates.

## 3. Cheap Talk, Fraud, and Adverse Selection in Financial Markets: Some Experimental Evidence
### Date

### Abstract
We examine communication in laboratory games with asymmetric information. Sellers know true asset qualities. Potential buyers only know the quality distribution. Prohibiting communication, we document the degree of adverse selection. Then we examine two alternative communication mechanisms. Under “cheap talk”, each seller can announce any subset of qualities. Under “antifraud”, the subset must include the true quality. Both mechanisms improve market efficiency, but very differently. Relying on sellers' frequently exaggerated claims, buyers often overpay under cheap talk. Efficiency gains come at the buyer's expense. The antifraud rule improves efficiency further and eliminates the wealth transfer from buyers to sellers.

## 4. The Underreaction Hypothesis and the New Issue Puzzle: Evidence from Japan
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
This article investigates the long-term equity performance of Japanese firms issuing convertible debt and equity. We find that issuing firms perform poorly (except for equity rights issues) compared to nonissuing firms even though the stock-price reaction to convertible debt and equity issues is not negative for Japanese firms. This underperformance is strongest for firms issuing public convertible debt. In contrast to the United States, poor performance is not concentrated in smaller firms and in firms with a high market-to-book ratio. Simple behavioral explanations advanced for the new issue puzzle in the United States do not seem consistent with the Japanese experience.

## 5. The Dynamics of Default and Debt Reorganization
### Date
- 01 June 2015
### Author
- Pierre Mella-Barral
### Abstract
This article documents the fact that when debtors decide to default on their obligations too early, it is in the creditors' collective interest, as residual claimants, to make concessions prior to forcing a costly liquidation. Symmetrically, when debtors prefer to default at an inefficiently late stage, it is in the creditors' interest to propose a departure from the absolute priority rule. This article develops a continuous time pricing model of dynamic debt restructuring that reflects the crucial influence of the two counterparties' relative bargaining power. Simple and intuitive path-dependent pricing formulae are derived for equity and debt. The debt capacity as well as the evolution of the firm's capital structure throughout its existence is provided.

## 6. Deposits and Relationship Lending
### Date
- 01 June 2015
### Author
- Mitchell Berlin
- Loretta J. Mester
### Abstract
We empirically examine whether access to deposits with inelastic rates (core deposits) permits a bank to make contractual agreements with borrowers that are infeasible if the bank must pay market rates for funds. Such access insulates a bank's costs of funds from exogenous shocks, allowing it to insulate its borrowers against exogenous credit shocks. We find that, controlling for loan market competition, banks funded more heavily with core deposits provide more loan rate smoothing in response to exogenous changes in aggregate credit risk. Thus we provide evidence for a novel channel linking bank liabilities to relationship lending.

## 7. A Transactions Data Analysis of Nonsynchronous Trading
### Date
- 01 June 2015
### Author

- Douglas M. Patterson
### Abstract
Weekly returns of stock portfolios exhibit substantial autocorrelation. Analytical studies suggest that nonsynchronous trading is capable of explaining from 5% to 65% of the autocorrelation. The varying importance of nonsynchronous trading in these studies arises primarily from differing assumptions regarding nontrading periods of stocks. We simulate the effects of nonsynchronous trading by sampling stock returns from a return generating process using transactions data to obtain the precise time of each stock's last trade. We find that simulated weekly portfolio returns exhibit autocorrelations that are roughly 25% that of their observed (CRSP) weekly returns.

## 8. Time-Varying Risk and Return in the Bond Market: A Test of a New Equilibrium Pricing Model
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
This article uses bond market data to empirically test the asset pricing model of Kazemi (1992). According to this model the rate of return on a long-term, pure-discount, default-free bond will be perfectly correlated with changes in the marginal utility of the representative investor. The covariability between financial asset returns and returns on such a bond can therefore serve as a measure of the riskiness of assets. The aim of this study is to determine whether the model can explain cross-sectional differences in the monthly returns of bonds with different maturity dates. We estimate and test the restrictions imposed by the model on returns of default-free bonds, while allowing the conditional distribution of bond returns to be time varying. The model is rejected during the full sample period (1973–1995) and the subperiod (1973–1980) when the Federal Reserve's focus is on interest rates, while the model is not rejected during the subperiod (1981–1995) when the Federal Reserve's focus is on money supply.
