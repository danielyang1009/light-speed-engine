## 1. Conflict of Interest and the Credibility of Underwriter Analyst Recommendations

### Abstract
Brokerage analysts frequently comment on and sometimes recommend companies that their firms have recently taken public. We show that stocks that underwriter analysts recommend perform more poorly than “buy” recommendations by unaffiliated brokers prior to, at the time of, and subsequent to the recommendation date. We conclude that the recommendations by underwriter analysts show significant evidence of bias. We show also that the market does not recognize the full extent of this bias. The results suggest a potential conflict of interest inherent in the different functions that investment bankers perform.

### Author

### Abstract
This article presents convenient reduced-form models of the valuation of contingent claims subject to default risk, focusing on applications to the term structure of interest rates for corporate or sovereign bonds. Examples include the valuation of a credit-spread option.

## 3. A Parametric Nonlinear Model of Term Structure Dynamics
### Date

### Abstract
Recent nonparametric estimation studies pioneered by Aït-Sahalia document that the diffusion of the short rate is similar to the parametric function, |$r^{1.5},$| estimated by Chan et al., whereas the drift is substantially nonlinear in the short rate. These empirical properties call into question the efficacy of the existing affine term structure models and beg for alternative models which admit the observed behavior. This article presents such a model. Our model delivers closed-form solutions for bond prices and a concave relationship between the interest rate and the yields. We show that in empirical analyses, our model outperforms the one-factor affine models in both time-series as well as cross-sectional tests.

## 4. Using Proxies for the Short Rate: When are Three Months Like an Instant?

### Abstract
The dynamics of the unobservable short rate are frequently estimated directly using a proxy. We examine the biases resulting from this practice (the “proxy problem”). Analytic results show that the proxy problem is not economically significant for single-factor affine models. In the two-factor affine model of Longstaff and Schwartz (1992), the proxy problem is only economically significant for pricing discount bonds with maturities of more than five years. We also describe two different numerical procedures for assessing the magnitude of the proxy problem in a general interest rate model. When applied to a nonlinear single-factor model, they suggest that the proxy problem can be economically significant.

## 5. Empty Promises and Arbitrage
### Date

### Abstract
Analysis of absence of arbitrage normally ignores payoffs in states to which the agent assigns zero probability. We extend the fundamental theorem of asset pricing to the case of “no empty promises” in which the agent cannot promise arbitrarily large payments in some states. There is a superpositive pricing rule that can assign positive price to claims in zero probability states important to the market as well as assigning positive prices to claims in the states of positive probability. With continuous information arrival, no empty promises can be enforced by shutting down the agent's subsequent investments once wealth hits zero.

## 6. Nontraded Asset Valuation with Portfolio Constraints: A Binomial Approach
### Date

### Abstract
We provide a simple binomial framework to value American-style derivatives subject to trading restrictions. The optimal investment of liquid wealth is solved simultaneously with the early exercise decision of the nontraded derivative. No-short-sales constraints on the underlying asset manifest themselves in the form of an implicit dividend yield in the risk-neutralized process for the underlying asset. One consequence is that American call options may be optimally exercised prior to maturity even when the underlying asset pays no dividends. Applications to executive stock options (ESO) are presented: it is shown that the value of an ESO could be substantially lower than that computed using the Black–Scholes model. We also analyze nontraded payoffs based on a price that is imperfectly correlated with the price of a traded asset.

## 7. Trade Disclosure Regulation in Markets with Negotiated Trades
### Date

### Abstract
In dealership markets disclosure of size and price of details of public trades is typically incomplete. We examine whether full and prompt disclosure of public-trade details improves the welfare of a risk-averse investor. We analyze a model of dealership market where a market maker first executes a public trade and then offsets her position by trading with other market makers. We distinguish between quantity risk and price revision risk. We show that if the market maker learns some information about the motive behind public trade, neither regime is unambiguously welfare superior. This is because greater transparency improves quantity risk sharing but worsens price revision risk sharing.

## 8. Filter Rules Based on Price and Volume in Individual Security Overreaction
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
I present evidence of predictability in a sample constructed to minimize concerns about time-varying risk premia and market-microstructure effects. I use filter rules on lagged return and lagged volume information to uncover weekly over-reaction profits on large-capitalization NYSE and AMEX securities. I find that decreasing-volume stocks experience greater reversals. Increasing-volume stocks exhibit weaker reversals and positive autocorrelation. A real-time simulation of the filter strategies suggests that an investor who pursues the filter strategy with relatively low transaction costs will strongly outperform an investor who follows a buy-and-hold strategy.
