### Abstract
In this article we provide econometric tools for the evaluation of intertemporal asset pricing models using specification-error and volatility bounds. We formulate analog estimators of these bounds, give conditions for consistency, and derive the limiting distribution of these estimators. The analysis incorporates market frictions such as short-sale constraints and proportional transactions costs. Among several applications we show how to use the methods to assess specific asset pricing models and to provide non-parametric characterizations of asset pricing anomalies.

## 2. A Critique of Size-Related Anomalies
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Jonathan B. Berk
### Abstract
This article argues that the size-related regularities in asset prices should not be regarded as anomalies. Indeed, the opposite result is demonstrated. Namely, a truly anomalous regularity would be if an inverse relation between size and return was not observed. We show theoretically (1) that the size-related regularities should be observed in the economy and (2) why size will in general explain the part of the cross-section of expected returns left unexplained by an incorrectly specified asset pricing model. In light of these results we argue that size-related measures should be used in cross-sectional tests to detect model misspecifications.

## 3. Measurement of Market Integration and Arbitrage
### Date

### Abstract
We develop a measurement theory of market integration, based on two notions of “integrated markets”. First, two markets cannot be perfectly integrated in any sense if one can construct two portfolios, one from each market, that have identical payoffs but different prices. In that case, the law of one price is violated across the markets. Second, they cannot be integrated in a stronger sense if there are cross-market arbitrage opportunities. Two measures of market integration are developed, respectively reflecting these notions. The smaller the measures, the more closely integrated (in the respective senses) the markets. Among other things, they are interpreted as measuring pricing discrepancy between markets.

## 4. The Role of Games in Security Design
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author

- Artur Raviv
### Abstract
We contend that security design should be approached as a problem of game design. That is, contracts should specify the procedures that govern the behavior of contract participants in determining outcomes as well as the allocations resulting from those outcomes. We characterize optimal contracts in two nested classes: all contracts (including those that depend on the state) and state-independent contracts. We demonstrate that, in situations in which the dependence of contracts on the state is limited, contracts designed as games can improve the allocation of resources relative to nonstrategic allocation rules.

## 5. The Effect of Tax Heterogeneity on Prices and Volume around the Ex-Dividend Day: Evidence from the Milan Stock Exchange
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Roni Michaely
- Maurizio Murgia
### Abstract
To investigate the effect of taxation on stock price and trading volume around the ex-dividend day, we use the Italian stock market, where dividends on two classes of stock are taxed differently. We find that the weighted average of investors’ tax rates is reflected in the ex-day prices and the variance of the relative tax rate across investors is reflected in the volume of trades. We also show that higher transaction costs result in higher ex-dividend day excess returns and lower abnormal volume. This finding is consistent with “profit elimination” activity by institutions and corporations.

## 6. Of Shepherds, Sheep, and the Cross-autocorrelations in Equity Returns
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
We present an economic mechanism and supportive empirical evidence for the transmission of information between equity securities first documented by Lo and MacKinlay (1990). It is argued that the past returns on stocks held by informed institutional traders will be positively correlated with the contemporaneous returns on stocks held by noninstitutional uninformed traders. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis is then presented. We document that the returns on the portfolio of stocks with the highest level of institutional ownership lead the returns on portfolios of stocks with lower levels of institutional ownership. This effect persists even after firm size is controlled for and is apparent at longer lags than the size-related lag effects documented in Lo and MacKinlay (1990).

## 7. Financial and Industrial Structure with Agency
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Joseph T. Williams
### Abstract
A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is characterized for an industry with dissipative costs of agency. In sequence, firms can enter the industry, raise capital with external debt and/or equity, invest in a capital-intensive technology or dissipate capital in perquisites, and finally produce output. For plausible values of two critical parameters, some firms forego in equilibrium investments with positive net present values. Although more managers would like their firms to invest in the capital-intensive technology, they cannot raise the required cash in the capital market. In equilibrium, the industry can have both a profitable core of large, secure, capital-intensive firms, with some debt but no unique optimal capital structure, and a competitive fringe of small, risky, labor-intensive firms. Even as the cost of entry converges to zero, capital-intensive firms can earn extraordinary profits, while all labor-intensive firms fail. With costly agency, access to capital can become a barrier to entry.

## 8. Option Pricing with Differential Interest Rates
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Yaacov Z. Bergman
### Abstract
The classic option pricing model is generalized to a more realistic, imperfect, dynamically incomplete capital market with different interest rates for borrowing and for lending and a return differential between long and short positions in stock. It is found that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the equilibrium price of any contingent claim must lie within an arbitrage-band. The boundaries of an arbitrage-band are computed as solutions to a quasi-linear partial differential equation, and, in general, each end-point of such a band depends on both interest rates for borrowing and for lending. This, in turn, implies that the vector of concurrent equilibrium prices of different contingent claims—even claims that are written on different underlying assets—must lie within a computable arbitrage-oval in the price space.

## 9. Investment and Insider Trading
### Date

### Abstract
We study insider trading in a dynamic setting. Rational, but uninformed, traders choose between investment projects with different levels of insider trading. Insider trading distorts investment toward assets with less private information. However, when investment is sufficiently information elastic, insider trading can be welfare-enhancing because of more informative prices. When insiders repeatedly receive information, they trade to reveal it when investment is information elastic because good news increases investment and hence future insider profits. Thus, more information is revealed and uninformed agents are exploited less frequently by insiders. Both effects are Pareto-improving. Finally, we consider various insider-trading regulations.

## 10. A Theory of Mutual Formation and Moral Hazard with Evidence from the History of the Insurance Industry
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Bruce D. Smith
- Michael Stutzer
### Abstract
Nonprofit, mutually owned insurance and banking organizations have significant market shares in the insurance and banking industries. A first step in a systematic study of these financial mutuals is to examine the reasons for their formation. Doing so provides empirical support for the view that these mutuals arose as an efficient means of addressing contracting challenges caused by aggregate uncertainties and moral hazard. A formal model with this property is presented. We argue that information asymmetries do more to explain the kinds of contracts offered by financial mutuals than do agency problems between owners, managers, and customers.
