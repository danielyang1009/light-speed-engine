## 1. Consolidation, Fragmentation, and the Disclosure of Trading Information
### Date

### Abstract
It is commonly believed that fragmented security markets have a natural tendency to consolidate. This article examines this belief, focusing on the effect of disclosing trading information to market participants. We show that large traders who place multiple trades can benefit from the absence of trade disclosure in a fragmented market, as can dealers who face less price competition than in a unified market. Consequently, a fragmented market need not coalesce into a single market unless trade disclosure is mandatory. We also compare and contrast fragmented and consolidated markets. Fragmentation results in higher price volatility and violations of price efficiency.

## 2. Tests of a Signaling Hypothesis: The Choice between Fixed- and Adjustable-Rate Debt
### Date

### Abstract
We develop a model wherein the choice between adjustable- and fixed-rate debt can serve as a signal of firm quality. The nature of the signal depends on expected inflation volatility relative to other risk parameters. Evidence from a matched sample of debt announcements over the period 1978 to 1986 shows a difference of |$ - 2.05 \ {\rm percent}$| between stock price reactions to adjustable rate and fixed rate announcements when expected inflation volatility is above an estimated threshold. Below this threshold, the difference is |$+0.98 \ {\rm percent}.$| The evidence supports the hypothesis that the riskier debt choice serves as a favorable signal of firm quality.

## 3. The Mandatory Disclosure of Trades and Market Liquidity
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author

- Kathleen M. Hagerty
### Abstract
Financial market regulations require various “insiders” to disclose their trades after the trades are made. We show that such mandatory disclosure rules can increase insiders’ expected trading profits. This is because disclosure leads to profitable trading opportunities for insiders even if they possess no private information on the asset’s value. We also show that insiders will generally not voluntarily disclose their trades, so for disclosure to be forthcoming, it must be mandatory. Key to the analysis is that the market cannot observe whether an insider is trading on private information regarding asset value or is trading for personal portfolio reasons.

## 4. Rational Prepayment and the Valuation of Mortgage-Backed Securities
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Richard Stanton
### Abstract
This article presents a new model of mortgage prepayments, based on rational decisions by mortgage holders. These mortgage holders face heterogeneous transaction costs, which are explicitly modeled. The model is estimated using a version of Hansen’s (1982) generalized method of moments, and is shown to capture many of the empirical features of mortgage prepayment. Estimation results indicate that mortgage holders act as though they face transaction costs that far exceed the explicit costs usually incurred on refinancing. They also wait an average of more than a year before refinancing, even when it is optimal to do so. The model fits observed prepayment behavior as well as the recent empirical model of Schwartz and Torous (1989). Implications for pricing mortgage-backed securities are discussed.

## 5. Do Long-Term Swings in the Dollar Affect Estimates of the Risk Premia?
### Date

### Abstract
Foreign exchange returns exhibit behavior difficult to reconcile with standard theoretical models. This article asks whether the recent findings of long swings in exchange rates between appreciating and depreciating periods affect estimates of the foreign exchange risk premium. We demonstrate how the “peso problem” introduced by expected shifts in exchange rate regimes can affect inferences about the risk premium in at least two ways: (1) it can make the foreign exchange risk premium appear to contain a permanent disturbance when it does not; and (2) it can induce bias in the foreign exchange return regressions such as in Fama (1984).

## 6. Corporate Incentives for Hedging and Hedge Accounting
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author

### Abstract
This article explores the information effect of financial risk management. Financial hedging improves the informativeness of corporate earnings as a signal of management ability and project quality by eliminating extraneous noise. Managerial and shareholder incentives regarding information transmission may differ, however, leading to conflicts regarding an optimal hedging policy. We show that these incentives depend on the accounting information made available by the firm. Under some circumstances, if hedge transactions are not disclosed (i.e., firms report only aggregate earnings), managers hedge to achieve greater risk reduction than they would if full disclosure were required. In these cases, it is optimal for shareholders to request only aggregate accounting reports.

## 7. Predictable Risk and Returns in Emerging Markets
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Campbell R. Harvey
### Abstract
The emergence of new equity markets in Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Mideast and Africa provides a new menu of opportunities for investors. These markets exhibit high expected returns as well as high volatility. Importantly, the low correlations with developed countries’ equity markets significantly reduces the unconditional portfolio risk of a world investor. However, standard global asset pricing models, which assume complete integration of capital markets, fail to explain the cross section of average returns in emerging countries. An analysis of the predictability of the returns reveals that emerging market returns are more likely than developed countries to be influenced by local information.

## 8. The ex-dividend-day behavior of stock prices: the case of Japan
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author
- Kiyoshi Kato
- Uri Loewenstein
### Abstract
We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of stock price behavior around the ex-dividend day in Japan. We find that prices rise on the ex-day and that dividend-related tax effects appear to be secondary. Returns around ex-dividend days are dominated by the proximity of many ex-days to the fiscal year end. Excess returns of 1 percent, which are independent of any dividend-related considerations, are higher than round-trip transaction costs on medium-sized transactions. Prices seem to imply selling pressure before and buying pressure at the start of the new fiscal year. These trading patterns appear to be motivated by intercorporate manipulative trading around the end of the firms’ fiscal year, which are unrelated to dividends.

## 9. Securities Trading in the Absence of Dealers: Trades and Quotes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author

- Joel Hasbrouck
### Abstract
This article investigates the behaviour of intraday trades and quotes for individual stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). We examine the transaction and quote record for three firms for the first 3 months of 1990. Our findings suggest that the immediacy available (at least for small trades) in the market is high, despite the reliance on public limit orders to supply liquidity. When orders that would otherwise walk through the limit order book are converted into limit orders, execution is delayed, but some orders execute (at least in part) at more favorable prices.

## 10. Closed-end Country Funds and U.S. Market Sentiment
### Date
- 28 May 2015
### Author

### Abstract
Closed-end country funds can trade at large premiums and discounts from their foreign asset values (NAVs). Investigating this anomaly, we find that individual fund premiums move together, primarily because of the comovement of their stock prices with the U.S. market. Moreover, an index of country fund premiums differentiates size-ranked U.S. portfolio returns and forecasts country fund stock returns. These findings suggest that international equity prices are affected by local risk. In particular, we show that country fund premium movements reflect a U.S.-specific risk, which may be interpreted as U.S. market sentiment.
