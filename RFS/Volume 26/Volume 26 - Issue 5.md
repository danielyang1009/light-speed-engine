## 1. An Institutional Theory of Momentum and Reversal

### Abstract
We propose a theory of momentum and reversal based on flows between investment funds. Flows are triggered by changes in fund managers' efficiency, which investors either observe directly or infer from past performance. Momentum arises if flows exhibit inertia, and because rational prices underreact to expected future flows. Reversal arises because flows push prices away from fundamental values. Besides momentum and reversal, flows generate comovement, lead-lag effects, and amplification, with these being larger for high idiosyncratic risk assets. A calibration of our model using evidence on mutual fund returns and flows generates sizeable Sharpe ratios for momentum and value strategies.

## 2. Book-to-Market Equity, Financial Leverage, and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns
### Date

### Abstract
I propose a new dynamic model of the firm that links operating leverage to both value premium and book-leverage premium in stock returns. Value firms are low-productivity firms with either high operating leverage or high financial leverage. Firms with high operating leverage maintain low book leverage ratios. When operating leverage is economically significant, both value firms and low book-leverage firms can have high equity risk premiums. In particular, value premium becomes positive while book-leverage premium becomes negative. Without operating leverage, the signs of these premiums are reversed. The model captures quantitatively several important properties of the cross-section of stock returns.

## 3. Corporate Leverage, Debt Maturity, and Credit Supply: The Role of Credit Default Swaps
### Date

### Abstract
Does the ability of suppliers of corporate debt capital to hedge risk through credit default swap (CDS) contracts impact firms' capital structures? We find that firms with traded CDS contracts on their debt are able to maintain higher leverage ratios and longer debt maturities. This is especially true during periods in which credit constraints become binding, as would be expected if the ability to hedge helps alleviate frictions on the supply side of credit markets.

## 4. Indirect Costs of Financial Distress in Durable Goods Industries: The Case of Auto Manufacturers
### Date

### Abstract
Financial distress can disrupt a durable goods producer's provision of complementary goods and services such as warranties, spare parts and maintenance. This reduces consumers' demand for the core product, causing indirect costs of financial distress. We test this hypothesis in the market for used cars sold at wholesale auctions. An increase in a manufacturer's credit default swaps significantly decreases the prices of its cars at auction, especially cars with longer expected service lives. Our estimates imply substantial indirect costs of financial distress for car manufacturers. These costs have occasionally even exceeded the tax savings benefits for General Motors and Ford.

## 5. Entangled Financial Systems
### Date
- 06 March 2013
### Author
- Adam Zawadowski
### Abstract
I model an entangled financial system in which banks hedge their portfolio risks using over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. However, banks choose not to hedge counterparty risk, and thus the idiosyncratic failure of a bank can lead to a systemic run of lenders. An inefficiency arises because banks engage in a version of risk shifting through the network externalities created by OTC contracts. Banks do not take into account that the costly hedging of low-probability counterparty risk also benefits other banks. In the model, it is welfare improving to tax OTC contracts to finance a bailout fund.

## 6. Economic Linkages, Relative Scarcity, and Commodity Futures Returns
### Date

### Abstract
This paper shows that economic linkages among commodities create a source of long-term correlation between futures returns. We extend the theory of storage to a multi-commodity level and find that the convenience yield of a commodity depends on its relative scarcity with respect to other related commodities. This implies a feedback effect between commodities that is necessary to replicate the upward-sloping correlation term structure of futures returns observed for related commodities. We present a multi-commodity affine model that validates our theoretical predictions and considerably reduces the pricing errors in out-of-sample crack spread options.
