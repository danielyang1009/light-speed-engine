## 1. Asset Pricing in the Dark: The Cross-Section of OTC Stocks
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
Over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are far less liquid, disclose less information, and exhibit lower institutional holdings than do listed stocks. We exploit these different market conditions to test theories of cross-sectional return premiums. Compared with premiums in listed markets, the OTC illiquidity premium is several times higher, the size, value, and volatility premiums are similar, and the momentum premium is three times lower. The OTC illiquidity, size, value, and volatility premiums are largest among stocks held predominantly by retail investors and those not disclosing financial information. Theories of differences in investors' opinions and limits on short sales help explain these return premiums.

## 2. A Supply Approach to Valuation
### Date

### Abstract
A new methodology for equity valuation arises from the perspective of managers' supply of capital assets. Under q-theory, managers optimally adjust the supply of assets to changes in their market value. The first-order condition of investment then provides a valuation equation that infers asset prices from managers' costs of supplying the assets. This equation fits well the Tobin's q levels across many testing assets, including portfolios formed on q. With current investment-to-capital as the only input, the supply approach does not require cash flow forecasts or discount rate estimates, both of which are notoriously difficult to obtain in practice.

## 3. Bond Illiquidity and Excess Volatility
### Date
- 04 July 2013
### Author

### Abstract
We find that the empirical volatilities of corporate bond and CDS returns are higher than implied by equity return volatilities and the Merton model. This excess volatility may arise because structural models inadequately capture either fundamentals or illiquidity. Our evidence supports the latter explanation. We find little relation between excess volatility and measures of firm fundamentals and the volatility of firm fundamentals but some relation with variables proxying for time-varying illiquidity. Consistent with an illiquidity explanation, firm-level bond portfolio returns, which average out bond-specific effects, significantly decrease excess volatility.

## 4. Dynamic Equilibrium with Two Stocks, Heterogeneous Investors, and Portfolio Constraints
### Date
- 20 June 2013
### Author
- Georgy Chabakauri
### Abstract
We study dynamic equilibrium in a Lucas economy with two stocks, two heterogeneous constant relative risk aversion investors, and portfolio constraints. We focus on margin and leverage constraints, which restrict access to credit. We find a positive relationship between the amount of leverage in the economy and magnitudes of stock return correlations and volatilities. Tighter constraints generate rich patterns in correlations and volatilities, make them less countercyclical, increase risk premia proportionally to assets' margins, and increase prices of low-margin assets more than prices of high-margin assets. We derive closed-form solutions for the unconstrained case and the case of leverage constraints.

## 5. The Flip Side of Financial Synergies: Coinsurance Versus Risk Contamination
### Date
- 20 August 2013
### Author
- Albert Banal-Estañol
- Marco Ottaviani
- Andrew Winton
### Abstract
This paper characterizes when joint financing of two projects through debt increases expected default costs, contrary to conventional wisdom. Separate financing dominates joint financing when risk-contamination losses—that are associated with the contagious default of a well-performing project that is dragged down by the other project's poor performance—outweigh standard coinsurance gains. Separate financing becomes more attractive than joint financing when the fraction of returns lost under default increases and when projects have lower mean returns, higher variability, more positive correlation, and more negative skewness. These predictions are broadly consistent with evidence on conglomerate mergers, spinoffs, project finance, and securitization.

## 6. Indexing Executive Compensation Contracts
### Date
- 19 August 2013
### Author

- Ernst Maug
- Oliver G. Spalt
### Abstract
We analyze the efficiency of indexing executive pay by calibrating the standard compensation model to a large sample of U.S. CEOs. The benefits from indexing the strike price of options are small, and fully indexing all options would increase compensation costs by 50% for most firms. Indexing has several effects with overall ambiguous outcome; the quantitatively most important effect is to reduce incentives, because indexed options pay off when CEOs' marginal utility is low. The results also hold if CEOs can extract rents and extend to the case of indexing shares. Our findings may justify the common practice of “pay-for-luck.”

## 7. Can Equity Volatility Explain the Global Loan Pricing Puzzle?
### Date
- 22 October 2013
### Author
- Lewis Gaul
- Pinar Uysal
### Abstract
This paper examines whether unobservable differences in firm volatility are responsible for the global loan pricing puzzle, which is the observation that corporate loan interest rates appear to be lower in Europe than in the United States. We analyze whether equity volatility, an error prone measure of firm volatility, can explain this difference in loan spreads. We show that using equity volatility in OLS regressions will result in biased and inconsistent estimates of the difference in U.S. and European loan spreads. We use instrumental variable methods to identify consistent estimates and find no difference in U.S. and European loan spreads.
