### Abstract
Bank-affiliated private equity groups account for 30% of all private equity investments. Their market share is highest during peaks of the private equity market, when the parent banks arrange more debt financing for in-house transactions yet have the lowest exposure to debt. Using financing terms and ex post performance, we show overall that banks do not make superior equity investments to those of stand-alone private equity groups. Instead, they appear to expand their private equity engagement to take advantage of the credit market booms, while capturing private benefits from cross-selling of other banking services.

## 2. The Skew Risk Premium in the Equity Index Market
### Date

### Abstract
We develop a new method for measuring moment risk premiums. We find that the skew premium accounts for over 40% of the slope in the implied volatility curve in the S&P 500 market. Skew risk is tightly related to variance risk, in the sense that strategies designed to capture the one and hedge out exposure to the other earn an insignificant risk premium. This provides a new testable restriction for asset pricing models trying to capture, in particular, disaster risk premiums. We base our results on a general trading strategy by replicating contracts that swap implied for realized conditional asset moments.

## 3. Libertarian Paternalism, Information Production, and Financial Decision Making

### Abstract
We develop a theoretical model to analyze the effects of libertarian paternalism on information production and financial decision making. Individuals in our model appreciate the information content of the recommendations made by a social planner. This affects their incentive to gather information, and in turn the speed at which information spreads across market participants, via social learning or formal advice channels. We characterize situations in which libertarian paternalism improves welfare and contrast them with scenarios in which this policy is suboptimal because of its negative impact on the production and propagation of information.

## 4. Estimating the Costs of Issuer-Paid Credit Ratings
### Date
- 01 September 2013
### Author

- Kimberly J. Cornaggia
### Abstract
We compare the stability and timeliness of credit ratings produced by a traditional issuer-paid rating agency (Moody's Investors Service) and a subscriber-paid rater (Rapid Ratings). Moody's ratings exhibit less volatility but are slower to identify default risk. We control for Moody's aversion to ratings volatility and still find its ratings lag Rapid Ratings'. More importantly, accuracy ratios indicate that Rapid Ratings provides a better ordinal ranking of credit risk. We quantify the loss avoidance associated with Rapid Ratings'signals to estimate costs associated with regulatory and contractual systems based on issuer-paid ratings.

## 5. Rating Shopping or Catering?
An Examination of the Response to Competitive Pressure for CDO Credit Ratings
### Date

### Author

- Jordan Nickerson
- Dragon Yongjun Tang
### Abstract
We examine whether “rating shopping” or “rating catering” is a more accurate characterization of rating agency interactions regarding collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Although investors paid a premium for dual ratings, AAA CDO tranches rated by both Moody's and S&P defaulted more frequently than tranches rated by only one of them, which is inconsistent with pure rating shopping. Rating agencies made upward adjustments beyond their model when their competitor had more lenient assumptions. Finally, consistent with rating catering, S&P's and Moody's adjustments and disagreements at security issuance were reflected in subsequent rating downgrades, suggesting that adjustments were harmful.

## 6. Optimal Life Cycle Portfolio Choice with Housing Market Cycles
### Date

### Abstract
In recent decades U.S. households have experienced residential house prices moving persistently, that is, returns being positively serially correlated. We set up a realistically calibrated life cycle model with slow-moving time variation in expected housing returns, showing that not only age, labor income, and pre-existing housing wealth but also the state of the housing market significantly affect household decisions. Consistently with the data, the model predicts that in good states of housing market cycles (1) homeownership rates increase, (2) households buying homes invest a larger share of their net worth in their home, and (3) these households lever up more.

## 7. Subprime Consumer Credit Demand: Evidence from a Lender's Pricing Experiment
### Date

### Abstract
Using a unique panel data set from a U.K. credit card company, we analyze the interest rate sensitivity of subprime credit card borrowers. In addition to all individual transactions and loan terms, we have access to details of a randomized interest rate experiment conducted by the lender on existing (inframarginal) loans. For the whole sample, we estimate a statistically significant £3.4 reduction in monthly credit demand in response to a five percentage point increase in interest rates. This aggregate response is small, but it masks very interesting heterogeneity in the sample. We find that only low-risk borrowers who fully utilize their credit cards lower their credit demand significantly when faced with an increase in interest rates. We also document that a five percentage point increase in interest rates generates significant additional revenue for the lender without inducing delinquency over a short horizon.

## 8. Financial Capacity and Discontinuous Investment: Evidence from Emerging Market Multibusiness Firms
### Date

### Author
- Gabriel Natividad
### Abstract
I provide a new characterization of internal capital markets in an emerging economy using daily divisional data on all Peruvian fish-processing firms. A regression discontinuity model exploiting government production bans on regulated divisions (“fishmeal”) shows that the increased investment in the nonfishmeal divisions due to the bans is substantial (over 30% of the mean value), after controlling for productivity. The redeployment of financial capacity into nonfishmeal investments is particularly sharper when external financing is more costly and when firms are more closely monitored by creditors. The value-creating nature of this redeployment is supported by its positive effects on nonfishmeal exports.
