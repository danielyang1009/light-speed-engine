## 1. The Myth of Diffuse Ownership in the United States
### Date
- 10 December 2007
### Author
- Clifford G. Holderness
### Abstract
This article offers evidence on the ownership concentration at a representative sample of U.S. public firms. Ninety-six percent of these firms have blockholders; these blockholders in aggregate own an average 39% of the common stock. The ownership of U.S. firms is similar to and by some measures more concentrated than the ownership of firms in other countries. These findings challenge current thinking on a number of issues, ranging from the nature of the agency conflict in domestic corporations to the relationship between ownership concentration and legal protections for investors around the world.

## 2. Takeovers and the Cross-Section of Returns

### Abstract
This paper considers the impact of the takeover likelihood on firm valuation. If firms are more likely to acquire when there is more free cash or lower required rates of return, the targets become more sensitive to shocks to cash flows or the price of risk. Ceteris paribus, firms exposed to takeovers have different rates of return than protected firms. Using takeover likelihood estimates, we create a “takeover factor,” buying (selling) firms with a high (low) takeover likelihood, which generates “abnormal” returns. Several tests confirm that the takeover factor helps explaining cross-sectional differences in equity returns and is related to takeover activity.

## 3. The Choice of Corporate Liquidity and Corporate Governance
### Date
- 19 April 2008
### Author

### Abstract
In this paper, I study how corporate governance influences firms’ choices between cash and lines of credit. Stakeholders may disagree about firms’ liquidity choices because they differ in the allocation of ex-post control rights for the firms’ liquidity reserves. Using state-level changes in takeover protection as exogenous shocks to corporate governance, I find that firms increase cash relative to lines of credit when the threat of takeover weakens. Consistent with the theory, this tendency is weaker for firms with good internal governance. Overall, my findings suggest the choice of corporate liquidity is a channel through which corporate governance works.

## 4. IPO Pricing and Allocation: A Survey of the Views of Institutional Investors
### Date
- 26 August 2008
### Author
- Tim Jenkinson
- Howard Jones
### Abstract
Despite the central importance of investors to all initial public offering (IPO) theories, relatively little is known about their role in practice. This article is based on a survey of how institutional investors assess IPOs, what information they provide to the investment banking syndicate, and the factors they believe influence allocations. We find that investor characteristics, in particular brokerage relationships with the bookrunner, are perceived to be the most important factors influencing allocations, which supports the view that IPO allocations are part of implicit quid pro quo deals with investment banks. The survey raises doubts as to the extent of information production or revelation.

## 5. Do IPOs Affect the Prices of Other Stocks? Evidence from Emerging Markets
### Date
- 29 March 2008
### Author
- Matías Braun
- Borja Larrain
### Abstract
We show that the introduction of a large asset permanently affects the prices of existing assets in a market. Using data from 254 initial public offerings (IPOs) in 22 emerging markets, we find that portfolios that covary highly with the IPO experience a decline in prices relative to other portfolios during the month of the issue. The effects are stronger when the IPO is issued in a market that is less integrated internationally and when the IPO is bigger. This evidence is consistent with the idea that shocks to asset supply have a significant effect on asset prices.

## 6. Asset Salability and Debt Maturity: Evidence from Nineteenth-Century American Railroads
### Date
- 18 April 2008
### Author
- Efraim Benmelech
### Abstract
I investigate the effect of assets' liquidation values on capital structure by exploiting the diversity of track gauges in nineteenth-century American railroads. The abundance of track gauges limited the redeployability of rolling stock and tracks to potential users with similar track gauge. Moreover, potential demand for both rolling stock and tracks was further diminished when many railroads went under equity receiverships. I find that the potential demand for a railroad's rolling stock and tracks were significant determinants of debt maturity and the amount of debt that was issued by railroads. The results are consistent with liquidation values models of financial contracting and capital structure.

## 7. Strategic Disclosure and Stock Returns: Theory and Evidence from US Cross-Listing
### Date
- 20 March 2008
### Author

- Masahiro Watanabe
- Yan Xu
### Abstract
When a firm exercises discretion to disclose or withhold information (strategic disclosure), risk-averse investors command higher expected returns when expected cash flows decrease, producing a negative correlation between these expectations. Moreover, stock returns exhibit stronger reversal than they do when full disclosure is enforced. We propose a model that makes these predictions and provide consistent evidence using a panel of foreign firms that list American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). We find significant shifts in the time-series properties of stock returns for firms that undergo large changes in disclosure environments, such as those cross-listing on the NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ and those from less-developed/emerging markets and code-law countries.

## 8. Leasing, Ability to Repossess, and Debt Capacity
### Date
- 29 March 2008
### Author
- Andrea L. Eisfeldt
- Adriano A. Rampini
### Abstract
This paper studies the financing role of leasing and secured lending. We argue that the benefit of leasing is that repossession of a leased asset is easier than foreclosure on the collateral of a secured loan, which implies that leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending. However, leasing involves agency costs due to the separation of ownership and control. More financially constrained firms value the additional debt capacity more and hence lease more of their capital than less constrained firms. We provide empirical evidence consistent with this prediction. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing by practitioners, namely that leasing “preserves capital,” which the academic literature considers a fallacy.

## 9. The Real Effects of Debt Certification: Evidence from the Introduction of Bank Loan Ratings
### Date
- 11 December 2007
### Author
- Amir Sufi
### Abstract
I examine the introduction of syndicated bank loan ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's in 1995 to evaluate whether third-party rating agencies affect firm financial and investment policy. The introduction of bank loan ratings leads to an increase in the use of debt by firms that obtain a rating, and also increases in firms' asset growth, cash acquisitions, and investment in working capital. Consistent with a causal effect of the ratings, the increase in debt usage and investment is concentrated in the set of borrowers who are of lower credit quality and do not have an issuer credit rating before 1995. A loan-level analysis demonstrates that previously unrated borrowers who obtain a loan rating gain increased access to the capital of less-informed investors. The results suggest that third-party debt certification has real effects on firm investment policy.

## 10. The Nature and Persistence of Buyback Anomalies
### Date
- 27 March 2008
### Author
- Urs Peyer
- Theo Vermaelen
### Abstract
Using recent data, we reject the hypothesis that the buyback anomalies first reported by Lakonishok and Vermaelen (1990, Journal of Finance 45:455–77) and Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995, Journal of Financial Economics 39:181–208) have disappeared over time. We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that open market repurchases are a response to a market overreaction to bad news: significant analyst downgrades, combined with overly pessimistic forecasts of long-term earnings. Stock prices after tender offers are set as if all investors tender their shares, but empirically they do not. Thus, the arbitrage opportunity persists because the market sets prices as if the average, not the marginal investor, determines the stock price.

## 11. The Performance of Private Equity Funds
### Date
- 19 March 2008
### Author
- Ludovic Phalippou
- Oliver Gottschalg
### Abstract
The performance of private equity funds as reported by industry associations and previous research is overstated. A large part of performance is driven by inflated accounting valuation of ongoing investments and we find a bias toward better performing funds in the data. We find an average net-of-fees fund performance of 3% per year below that of the S&P 500. Adjusting for risk brings the underperformance to 6% per year. We estimate fees to be 6% per year. We discuss several misleading aspects of performance reporting and some side benefits as a first step toward an explanation.
