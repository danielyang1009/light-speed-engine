## 1. Harming Depositors and Helping Borrowers: The Disparate Impact of Bank Consolidation
### Date

### Abstract
A model of multimarket spatial competition is developed where small, single-market banks compete with large, multimarket banks (LMBs) for retail loans and deposits. Consistent with empirical evidence, LMBs are assumed to set retail interest rates uniformly across markets, have different operating costs, and have access to wholesale funding. If LMBs have significant funding advantages that offset potential loan operating cost disadvantages, then market-extension mergers by LMBs promote loan competition, especially in concentrated markets. However, such mergers reduce retail deposit competition, especially in less concentrated markets. Prior empirical research and our own analysis of retail deposit rates support the model's predictions.

## 2. Bank Debt and Corporate Governance

### Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the disciplining role of banks and bank debt in the market for corporate control. We find that relationship bank lending intensity and bank client network have positive effects on the probability of a borrowing firm becoming a target. This effect is enhanced in cases where the target and acquirer have a relationship with the same bank. Moreover, we utilize an experiment to show that the effects of relationship bank lending intensity on takeover probability are not driven by endogeneity. Finally, we also investigate reasons motivating a bank's informational role in the market for corporate control.

## 3. Disappearing Dividends, Catering, and Risk
### Date

### Abstract
Fama and French (2001a) show that the propensity to pay dividends declines significantly between 1978 and 1999. We examine this “disappearing dividends” puzzle through the lens of risk and report two main findings: (i) Risk is a significant determinant of the propensity to pay dividends, and it explains roughly 40% of disappearing dividends; (ii) We find little support for the view that disappearing dividends reflects firms' catering to transient fads for dividends. Absent risk controls, proxies for fads matter, but these proxies are insignificant once we control for risk. Our results are robust to an extensive battery of robustness tests that vary samples, time periods, proxies for fads, the types of empirical tests, and the nature of payout decisions made by firms.

## 4. Financial Contracting with Optimistic Entrepreneurs
### Date
- 20 June 2008
### Author

- David Thesmar
### Abstract
Optimistic beliefs are a source of nonpecuniary benefits for entrepreneurs that can explain the “Private Equity Puzzle.” This paper looks at the effects of entrepreneurial optimism on financial contracting. When the contract space is restricted to debt, we show the existence of a separating equilibrium in which optimists self-select into short-term debt and realists into long-term debt. Long-term debt is optimal for a realist entrepreneur as it smooths payoffs across states of nature. Short-term debt is optimal for optimists for two reasons: (i) “bridging the gap in beliefs” by letting the entrepreneur take a bet on his project’s success, and (ii) letting the investor impose adaptation decisions in bad states.

## 5. Do Retail Trades Move Markets?
### Date
- 16 April 2008
### Author
- Brad M. Barber
- Terrance Odean
- Ning Zhu
### Abstract
We study the trading of individual investors using transaction data and identifying buyer- or seller-initiated trades. We document four results: (1) Small trade order imbalance correlates well with order imbalance based on trades from retail brokers. (2) Individual investors herd. (3) When measured annually, small trade order imbalance forecasts future returns; stocks heavily bought underperform stocks heavily sold by 4.4 percentage points the following year. (4) Over a weekly horizon, small trade order imbalance reliably predicts returns, but in the opposite direction; stocks heavily bought one week earn strong returns the subsequent week, while stocks heavily sold earn poor returns.

## 6. The Stock Market and Corporate Investment: A Test of Catering Theory
### Date
- 02 April 2008
### Author
- Christopher Polk
- Paola Sapienza
### Abstract
We test a catering theory describing how stock market mispricing might influence individual firms' investment decisions. We use discretionary accruals as our proxy for mispricing. We find a positive relation between abnormal investment and discretionary accruals; that abnormal investment is more sensitive to discretionary accruals for firms with higher R&D intensity (opaque firms) or share turnover (firms with shorter shareholder horizons); that firms with high abnormal investment subsequently have low stock returns; and that the larger the relative price premium, the stronger the abnormal return predictability. We show that patterns in abnormal returns are stronger for firms with higher R&D intensity or share turnover.

## 7. Promotion Tournaments and Capital Rationing
### Date
- 02 October 2008
### Author

- John C. Persons
### Abstract
We analyze capital allocation in a conglomerate where divisional managers with uncertain abilities compete for promotion to CEO. A manager can sometimes gain by unobservably adding variance to divisional performance. Capital rationing can limit this distortion, increase productive efficiency, and allow the owner to make more accurate promotion decisions. Firms for which CEO talent is more important for firm performance are more likely to ration capital. A rationed manager is more likely to be promoted even though all managers are identical ex ante. When the tournament payoff is relatively small, offering an incentive wage can be more efficient than rationing capital; however, when tournament incentives are paramount, rationing is more efficient.

## 8. A Liquidity-Based Theory of Closed-End Funds
### Date
- 02 April 2008
### Author
- Martin Cherkes
- Jacob Sagi
- Richard Stanton
### Abstract
This paper develops a rational, liquidity-based model of closed-end funds (CEFs) that provides an economic motivation for the existence of this organizational form: They offer a means for investors to buy illiquid securities, without facing the potential costs associated with direct trading and without the externalities imposed by an open-end fund structure. Our theory predicts the patterns observed in CEF initial public offerings (IPOs) and the observed behavior of the CEF discount, which results from a trade-off between the liquidity benefits of investing in the CEF and the fees charged by the fund's managers. In particular, the model explains why IPOs occur in waves in certain sectors at a time, why funds are issued at a premium to net asset value (NAV), and why they later usually trade at a discount. We also conduct an empirical investigation, which, overall, provides more support for a liquidity-based model than for an alternative sentiment-based explanation.

## 9. Differences of Opinion of Public Information and Speculative Trading in Stocks and Options
### Date
- 27 March 2008
### Author
- H. Henry Cao
- Hui Ou-Yang
### Abstract
We analyze the effects of differences of opinion on the dynamics of trading volume in stocks and options. We find that disagreements about the mean of the current- and next-period public information lead to trading in stocks in the current period but have no effect on options trading. Without options, we find that disagreements about the precision of all past and current public information affect trading in stocks in the current period. With options, only disagreements about the precisions of the next- and current-period information affect stocks and options trading in the current period. Our results suggest that options trading is concentrated around information events that are likely to cause disagreements among investors, whereas trading in stocks may be diffusive over many periods.

## 10. Multinationals as Arbitrageurs: The Effect of Stock Market Valuations on Foreign Direct Investment
### Date
- 19 March 2008
### Author

- C. Fritz Foley
- Jeffrey Wurgler
### Abstract
Empirical evidence of imperfect integration across world capital markets suggests a role for cross-border arbitrage by multinationals. Consistent with multinational arbitrage as a determinant of foreign direct investment (FDI) patterns, we find that FDI flows increase sharply with source-country stock market valuations—particularly the component of valuations that is predicted to revert the next year, and particularly in the presence of capital account restrictions that limit other mechanisms of cross-country arbitrage. The results suggest the existence of a cheap financial capital channel in which FDI flows reflect, in part, the use of relatively low-cost capital available to overvalued parents in the source country.

## 11. Are There Permanent Valuation Gains to Overseas Listing?
### Date
- 02 March 2008
### Author
- Sergei Sarkissian
- Michael J. Schill
### Abstract
This paper tests whether foreign equity listings are associated with permanent valuation gains and examines how market and firm characteristics influence any valuation effects. Using a global sample of 1,676 listings placed in 25 countries, we find that much of the valuation gains to overseas listings are not permanent. The transitory nature of valuation gains holds for both average US listings and average first-time firm listings. We find little evidence of a permanent effect on returns for firms that list abroad, even for firms’ listings in markets that are more liquid, provide better legal protection, or have a larger shareholder base.

## 12. Multiple-Predictor Regressions: Hypothesis Testing
### Date
- 13 June 2008
### Author
- Yakov Amihud
- Clifford M. Hurvich
- Yi Wang
### Abstract
We propose a new hypothesis-testing method for multipredictor regressions in small samples, where the dependent variable is regressed on lagged variables that are autoregressive. The new test is based on the augmented regression method (Amihud and Hurvich, 2004), which produces reduced-bias coefficients and is easy to implement. The method's usefulness is demonstrated by simulations and by testing a model where stock returns are predicted by two variables, income-to-consumption and dividend yield.

## 13. Estimating Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches
### Date
- 03 June 2008
### Author
- Mitchell A. Petersen
### Abstract
In corporate finance and asset pricing empirical work, researchers are often confronted with panel data. In these data sets, the residuals may be correlated across firms or across time, and OLS standard errors can be biased. Historically, researchers in the two literatures have used different solutions to this problem. This paper examines the different methods used in the literature and explains when the different methods yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge. The intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their use.
