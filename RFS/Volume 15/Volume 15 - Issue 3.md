## 1. Option Exercise Games: An Application to the Equilibrium Investment Strategies of Firms
### Date

### Abstract
Under the standard real options approach to investment under uncertainty, agents formulate optimal exercise strategies in isolation and ignore competitive interactions. However, in many real-world asset markets, exercise strategies cannot be determined separately, but must be formed as part of a strategic equilibrium. This article provides a tractable approach for deriving equilibrium investment strategies in a continuous-time Cournot–Nash framework. The impact of competition on exercise strategies is dramatic. For example, while standard real options models emphasize that a valuable “option to wait” leads firms to invest only at large positive net present values, the impact of competition drastically erodes the value of the option to wait and leads to investment at very near the zero net present value threshold.

## 2. The Effect of Leverage on Bidding Behavior: Theory and Evidence from the FCC Auctions
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author

- S. Abraham Ravid
### Abstract
This is an exploration of how bidding behavior of firms in various auctions is affected by their capital structure. The theoretical model considers a first-price sealed bid and an English auction. We find that as debt levels increase, firms tend to reduce their bids. The lower bids give the competition incentives to reduce their bids as well. These results are investigated empirically using data from the 1994–1995 FCC spectrum auctions. Consistent with the theoretical model, higher debt levels of the bidding firm and of the competition tend to lead to lower bids. Additional determinants of bidding behavior in these auctions are also analyzed.

## 3. Macroeconomic Factors Do Influence Aggregate Stock Returns
### Date

### Abstract
Stock market returns are significantly correlated with inflation and money growth. The impact of real macroeconomic variables on aggregate equity returns has been difficult to establish, perhaps because their effects are neither linear nor time invariant. We estimate a GARCH model of daily equity returns, where realized returns and their conditional volatility depend on 17 macro series’ announcements. We find six candidates for priced factors: three nominal (CPI, PPI, and a Monetary Aggregate) and three real (Balance of Trade, Employment Report, and Housing Starts). Popular measures of overall economic activity, such as Industrial Production or GNP are not represented.

## 4. Are the Fama and French Factors Global or Country Specific?
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author
- John M. Griffin
### Abstract
This article examines whether country-specific or global versions of Fama and French’s three-factor model better explain time-series variation in international stock returns. Regressions for portfolios and individual stocks indicate that domestic factor models explain much more time-series variation in returns and generally have lower pricing errors than the world factor model. In addition, decomposing the world factors into domestic and foreign components demonstrates that the addition of foreign factors to domestic models leads to less accurate in-sample and out-of-sample pricing. Practical applications of the three-factor model, such as cost of capital calculations and performance evaluations, are best performed on a country-specific basis.

## 5. Optimal Portfolio Selection with Transaction Costs and Finite Horizons
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author

- Mark Loewenstein
### Abstract
We examine the optimal trading strategy for a CRRA investor who maximizes the expected utility of wealth on a finite date and faces transaction costs. Closed-form solutions are obtained when this date is uncertain. We then show a sequence of analytical solutions converge to the solution to the problem with a deterministic finite horizon. Consistent with the common life-cycle investment advice, the optimal trading strategy is found to be horizon dependent and largely buy and hold. Moreover, it might be optimal for the investor in our model not to buy any stock, even when the risk premium is positive. Further analysis of the optimal policy is also provided.

## 6. Risk Arbitrage in Takeovers
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author
- Francesca Cornelli
- David D. Li
### Abstract
This article studies the role of risk arbitrageurs in takeovers and the source of their advantage. We show how the presence of arbitrageurs affects the value of the target shares, since arbitrageurs are more likely to tender. Therefore an arbitrageur has the informational advantage of knowing he bought shares. In equilibrium, the number of arbitrageurs buying shares and the price they pay are determined endogenously. We also present several empirical implications, including the relationship among trading volume, takeover premium, liquidity of the shares, and the number of risk arbitrageurs investing in one particular deal.

## 7. Why New Issues and High-Accrual Firms Underperform: The Role of Analysts’ Credulity
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author
- Siew Hong Teoh
- T. J. Wong
### Abstract
We find that analysts’ forecast errors are predicted by past accounting accruals (adjustments to cash flows to obtain reported earnings) among both equity issuers and nonissuers. Analysts are more optimistic for the subsequent four years for issuers reporting higher issue-year accruals. The predictive power is greater for discretionary accruals than nondiscretionary accruals and is independent of the presence of an underwriting affiliation. Predicted forecast errors from accruals significantly explain the long-term underperformance of new issuers. The predictability of forecast errors among nonissuers suggests that analysts’ credulity about accruals management more generally contributes to market inefficiency.

## 8. Competition, Adverse Selection, and Information Dispersion in the Banking Industry
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author
- Robert Marquez
### Abstract
Proprietary information generated through the process of lending can impact the structure of the banking industry. With more competing banks, borrower-specific information becomes more disperse, as each bank becomes informed about a smaller pool of borrowers. This reduces banks’ screening ability, creating an inefficiency as more low-quality borrowers obtain financing. Incumbent banks’ information advantage may also create difficulties for potential entrants, so that entry should be easier in markets with high borrower turnover or where entrants have specific expertise in evaluating credit risks. We draw implications for whether financial deregulation is likely to increase borrowers’ surplus, and what patterns of entry might be observed.

## 9. Financial Innovation and Information: The Role of Derivatives When a Market for Information Exists
### Date
- 16 June 2015
### Author
- Massimo Massa
### Abstract
We study the effects of financial innovation in a model of endogenous information acquisition. We determine the conditions under which the introduction of a derivative written on an existing stock increases or decreases the incentive to purchase information. We show that financial innovation produces some effects which hold across informational structures and others which differ. The former coincide with the few empirical results that are robust in the literature (effects on prices, risk premia, and volatility), while the latter coincide with the ones that differ experiment by experiment (effects on volume, correlation between volume and volatility, and market informational efficiency).

## 10. Nondiscriminating Foreclosure and Voluntary Liquidating Costs
### Date

### Abstract
Since liquidation and bankruptcy are costly, researchers have tried to find out why the claimants of a troubled firm do not work out a deal to avoid these costs. In this article we show that if a creditor has to deal with multiple borrowers who might default, it may be optimal for the creditor to randomly reject requests for a loan workout. We further demonstrate that the optimal acceptance rate used by a creditor is positively related to the liquidating cost and negatively related to the default benefit. Our model is particularly relevant when analyzing the default decisions of mortgage borrowers and small business owners.
