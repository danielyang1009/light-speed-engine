## 1. Global Dollar Credit and Carry Trades: A Firm-Level Analysis

### Abstract
We conduct a firm-level analysis of borrowing in US dollars by nonfinancial corporates from outside the United States. We find that emerging market firms with already high cash holdings are more likely to issue US dollar-denominated bonds, especially during periods when the dollar carry trade is more favorable. The proceeds of the dollar bond issuance add to the firm’s cash holdings more than other sources of funds. The evidence points to financial decisions that resemble carry trades, rather than to precautionary borrowing in anticipation of future financing needs.

## 2. Differences of Opinion and International Equity Markets

### Abstract
We develop an international financial market model in which domestic and foreign residents differ in their beliefs about the information content in public signals. We determine how informational advantages of domestic investors in the interpretation of home public signals affect equity markets. We evaluate the ability of our model to generate four international-finance anomalies: (i) the co-movement of returns and capital flows, (ii) home-equity preference, (iii) the dependence of firm returns on home and foreign factors, and (iv) abnormal returns around foreign firm cross-listing in the home market. Their relationships with empirical differences-of-opinion proxies are consistent with the model.

## 3. Retail Short Selling and Stock Prices
### Date

### Abstract
Using proprietary data on millions of trades by retail investors, we provide the first large-scale evidence that retail short selling predicts negative stock returns. A portfolio that mimics weekly retail shorting earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of 9%. The predictive ability of retail short selling lasts for one year and is not subsumed by institutional short selling. In contrast to institutional shorting, retail shorting best predicts returns in small stocks and those that are heavily bought by other retail investors. Our findings are consistent with retail short sellers having unique insights into the retail investor community and small firms’ fundamentals.

## 4. Pre-market Trading and IPO Pricing

### Abstract
Studying the only mandatory pre-IPO market in the world—Taiwan’s Emerging Stock Market (ESM)—we document that pre-market prices are very informative about post-market prices and that informativeness increases with a stock’s liquidity. The ESM price-earnings ratio shortly before an initial public offering explains about 90% of the variation in the offer price-earnings ratio. However, the average IPO underpricing level remains high, at 55%, suggesting that agency problems between underwriters and issuers can lead to excessive underpricing, even with little valuation uncertainty. Also, regulations impact the relative bargaining power of players and therefore IPO pricing.

## 5. Individual Investor Activity and Performance
### Date

### Abstract
We examine the daily activity and performance of a large panel of individual investors from Sweden’s Premium Pension System. We find that active investors earn higher returns and risk-adjusted returns than do inactive investors. A performance decomposition analysis reveals that most outperformance by active investors is the result of active investors successfully timing mutual funds and asset classes. While activity is beneficial for some investors, extreme flows out of mutual funds affect funds’ net asset values negatively for all investors. Financial advisors, by contributing to coordinate investments and redemptions, exacerbate these negative effects.

## 6. Inflation Bets on the Long Bond
### Date
- 24 December 2016

### Abstract
The liquidity premium theory of interest rates predicts that the Treasury yield curve steepens with inflation uncertainty as investors demand larger risk premiums to hold long-term bonds. By using the dispersion of inflation forecasts to measure this uncertainty, we find the opposite. Since the prices of long-term bonds move more with inflation than short-term ones, investors also disagree and speculate more about long-maturity payoffs with greater uncertainty. Shorting frictions, measured by using Treasury lending fees, then lead long maturities to become overpriced and the yield curve to flatten. We estimate this inflation-betting effect using time variation in inflation disagreement and Treasury supply.

## 7. Mind the Gap: The Difference between U.S. and European Loan Rates
### Date

### Abstract
We analyze pricing differences between U.S. and European syndicated loans over the 1992–2014 period. We explicitly distinguish credit lines from term loans. For credit lines, U.S. borrowers pay significantly higher spreads, but lower fees, resulting in similar total costs of borrowing in both markets. Credit line usage is more cyclical in the United States, which provides a rationale for the pricing structure difference. For term loans, we analyze the channels of the cross-country loan price differential and document the importance of: the composition of term loan borrowers and the loan supply by institutional investors and foreign banks.

## 8. Bank Capital and Dividend Externalities
### Date
- 24 December 2016
### Author

### Abstract
Dividend payouts erode equity capital and affect the relative value of claims on a bank. Through this channel, when banks have contingent claims on each other, one bank’s capital policy affects the equity value and risk of default for other banks. When such externalities are strong, bank capital becomes a public good, whereby the private equilibrium features excessive dividends and inefficient recapitalization relative to the efficient policy that maximizes total banking sector equity. We relate these implications to the observed bank behaviour during the crisis of 2007–2009.

## 9. Law and Finance Matter: Lessons from Externally Imposed Courts
### Date

### Abstract
This paper provides novel evidence on the real and financial market effects of legal institutions. Our analysis exploits persistent and externally imposed differences in court enforcement that arose when the U.S. Congress assigned state courts to adjudicate contracts on a subset of Native American reservations. Using area-specific data on small business lending, we find that reservations assigned to state courts, which enforce contracts more predictably than tribal courts, have stronger credit markets. Moreover, the law-driven component of credit market development is associated with significantly higher per capita income, with stronger effects in sectors that depend more on external financing.
