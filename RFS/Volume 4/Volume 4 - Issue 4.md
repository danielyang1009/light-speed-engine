### Abstract
We show that there is an asymmetry in the predictability of the volatilities of large versus small firms. Using both univariate and multivariate ARMA–GARCH-M parameterizations, we find that volatility surprises to large market value firms are important to the future dynamics of their own returns as well as the returns of smaller firms. Conversely, however, shocks to smaller firms have no impact on the behavior of either the mean or the variance of the returns of larger capitalization companies.

## 2. Estimation of the Bid–Ask Spread and Its Components: A New Approach

### Abstract
We show that time variation in expected returns and/or partial price adjustments lead to a downward bias in previous estimators of both the spread and its components. We introduce a new approach that provides unbiased and efficient estimators of the components of the spread. We find that between 77 and 97 percent of the downward bias in previous spread estimates is caused by time variation in expected returns. More importantly, the adverse-selection component, though significant, accounts for a much smaller proportion (8 to 13 percent) of the quoted spread, at least for small trades, than the proportion (over 40 percent) previously reported in the literature. Order processing costs are the predominant component of quoted spreads.

## 3. Intraday Volatility in the Stock Index and Stock Index Futures Markets

### Abstract
We examine the intraday relationship between returns and returns volatility in the stock index and stock index futures markets. Our results indicate a strong intermarket dependence in the volatility of the cash and futures returns. Price innovations that originate in either the stock or futures markets can predict the future volatility in the other market. We show that this relationship persists even during periods in which the dependence in the returns themselves appears to weaken. The findings are robust to controlling for potential market frictions such as asynchronous trading in the stock index. Our results have implications for understanding the pattern of information flows between the two markets.

## 4. The Effect of Information Releases on the Pricing and Timing of Equity Issues
### Date
- 05 May 2015
### Author

### Abstract
With time-varying adverse selection in the market for new equity issues, firms will prefer to issue equity when the market is most informed about the quality of the firm. This implies that equity issues tend to follow credible information releases. In addition, if the asymmetry in information increases over time between information releases, the price drop at the announcement of an equity issue should increase in the time since the last information release. Using earnings releases as a proxy for informative events, we find evidence supporting these propositions.

## 5. Preplay Communication, Participation Restrictions, and Efficiency in Initial Public Offerings
### Date
- 05 May 2015
### Author

- Sanjay Srivastava
### Abstract
The extent to which the observed procedures for selling new issues are efficient is studied. We show that a posted-price mechanism, in conjunction with nonbinding preplay communication and participation restrictions, leads to an allocation of the security (and payment) that maximizes the seller’s expected revenue, given the informational constraints imposed by the optimizing incentives of the potential buyers.

## 6. Stock Price Distributions with Stochastic Volatility: An Analytic Approach
### Date

### Author

- Jeremy C. Stein
### Abstract
We study the stock price distributions that arise when prices follow a diffusion process with a stochastically varying volatility parameter. We use analytic techniques to derive an explicit closed-form solution for the case where volatility is driven by an arithmetic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (or AR1) process. We then apply our results to two related problems in the finance literature: (i) options pricing in a world of stochastic volatility, and (ii) the relationship between stochastic volatility and the nature of “fat tails” in stock price distributions.

## 7. Econometric Aspects of the Variance-Bounds Tests: A Survey
### Date

### Abstract
We survey the variance-bounds tests of asset-price volatility, stressing the econometric aspects of these tests. The first variance-bounds tests of the present-value relation reported apparently striking evidence of excess volatility of asset prices. The statistical significance of the results, however, was either marginal or, in the case of model-free tests, impossible to assess. Moreover, the tests were soon criticized for a number of biases. Various other tests of the present-value relation were later developed, avoiding in different degrees the econometric problems attending the first-generation tests. The majority of these second-generation tests also found excess volatility, though sometimes of borderline statistical significance. This finding of excess volatility is robust and is difficult to explain within the representative-consumer, frictionless-market model.
