### Abstract
Stock prices cluster on round fractions. Clustering increases with price level and volatility. and decreases with capitalization and transaction frequency. Clustering is pervasive. Price clustering will occur if traders use discrete price sets to simplify their negotiations. Exchange regulations require that most stocks be traded on eighths. Clustering on larger fractions will occur if traders choose to use discrete price sets based on quarters, halves, or whole numbers. An econometric model of clustering is derived and estimated. Projections from the result suggest that traders would frequently use odd sixteenths when trading low-price stocks, if exchange regulations permitted trading on sixteenths.

## 3. Risk Aversion, Market Liquidity, and Price Efficiency

### Abstract
A model of a noncompetitive speculative market is analyzed in which privately informed traders and market makers are risk averse. Market liquidity is found to be nonmonotonic in the number of informed traders, their degree of risk aversion, and the precision of their information. It is also shown that increased liquidity trading leads to reduced priced efficiency, and that, under endogenous information acquisition, market liquidity may also be nonmonotonic in the variance of liquidity trades.

## 4. Sunshine Trading and Financial Market Equilibrium

### Abstract
In this article, we consider the possibility that some liquidity traders preannounce the size of their orders, a practice that has come to be known as “sunshine trading”. Two possible effects preannouncement might have on the equilibrium are examined. First, since it identifies certain trades as informationless, preannouncement changes the nature of any informational asymmetries in the market. Second, preannouncement can coordinate the supply and demand of liquidity in the market. We show that preannouncement typically reduces the trading costs of those who preannounce, but its effects on the trading costs and welfare of other traders are ambiguous. We also examine the implications of preannouncement for the distribution of prices and the amount of information that prices reveal.

## 5. Multimarket Trading and Market Liquidity

### Abstract
When a security trades at multiple locations simultaneously, an informed trader has several avenues in which to exploit his private information. The greater the proportion of liquidity trading by “large” traders who can split their trades across markets, the larger is the correlation between volume in different markets and the smaller is the informativeness of prices. We show that one of the markets emerges as the dominant location for trading in that security. When informed traders can use their information for more than one trading period, the timely release of price information by market makers at one location adversely affects the profits informed traders expect to make subsequently at other locations. Market makers, competing to offer the lowest cost of trading at their location, consequently deter informed trading by voluntarily making the price information public and by “cracking down” on insider trading.

## 6. Market Microstructure Effects of Government Intervention in the Foreign Exchange Market

### Abstract
An asymmetric information model of the bid–ask spread is developed for a foreign exchange market subject to occasional government interventions. Traditional tests of the unbiasedness of the forward rate as a predictor of the future spot rate are shown to be inconsistent when the rates are measured as the average of their respective bid and ask quotes. Larger bid–ask spreads on Fridays are documented. Reliable evidence of asymmetric bid–ask spreads for all days of the week, albeit more pronounced on Fridays, are presented. The null hypothesis that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate continues to be rejected. The regression slope coefficients increase toward unity, however, indicating a less variable risk premium.

## 7. Volatility in the Foreign Currency Futures Market
### Date

### Abstract
We examine the volatility implications of around-the-clock foreign exchange trading with transaction data on futures contracts from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London International Financial Futures Exchange. We find higher U.S.–European and U.S.–Japanese exchange-rate volatilities during U.S. trading hours and higher European cross-rate volatilities during European trading hours. While the disclosure of private information through trading may partly explain these volatility patterns, we conclude that the increased volatility is more likely driven by macroeconomic news announcements. An analysis of inter- and intraday data also reveals that volatility increases at times that coincide with the release of U.S. macroeconomic news.

## 8. The Summary Informativeness of Stock Trades: An Econometric Analysis
### Date

### Abstract
In a security market with asymmetrically informed participants, trades are signals of private information. In this article, new measures of trade informativeness are proposed based on a decomposition of the variance of changes in the efficient price into trade-correlated and -uncorrelated components. The trade-correlated component has a natural interpretation as an absolute measure of trade informativeness. The ratio of this component to the total variance is a relative measure (i.e., a proportion normalized with respect to the total public information). For a sample of NYSE-listed companies, trades are found to be more informative for small firms in both absolute and relative senses. From an analysis of intraday patterns, it appears that trades are in absolute terms more informative at the beginning of trading, but slightly less informative in relative terms.
