            "abstract": "For the last two decades, firms with higher debt have reduced their employment more often, used more part time and seasonal employees, paid lower wages, and funded pension plans less generously. These effects are economically significant and cannot be explained by variation in performance. Thus debt seems to discipline the employment relationship. However, this result reflects a clear historical reversal, during the years 1967\u201373, of the opposite effect that prevailed in the 1950s. Apparently some of the disciplinary effects of debt are driven by forces that emerged during the period now colloquially referred to as the Sixties.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the motivations for and consequences of including a broad group of employees in leveraged buyouts by comparing employee buyouts (EBOs) to transactions where only top level managers participate, or management buyouts (MBOs). We examine the implications of including employees in a buyout from a labor contracting, financing, and management control point of view. A major finding is that employee participation helps to finance the buyout. The EBO allows firms to gain access to excess pension assets by converting employees' defined benefit pension capital into equity claims, thus freeing the excess assets in the pension plan to help fund the buyout. Also, employee participation substitutes equity claims for cash labor compensation costs and therefore allows the firm to borrow more than otherwise would be possible. There is also evidence consistent with managers including employees to maintain or enhance incumbent management's control.",

            "abstract": "We present evidence that insured deposit financing shields banks from the full costs of market discipline. Moody's downgrades, indicators of increasing risk, are associated with negative abnormal equity returns that are increasing in the bank's reliance on insured deposits. Moreover, banks raise their use of insured deposits following increases in risk. These findings cast doubt on the ability of capital market participants to effectively discipline bank behavior within the current regulatory environment. More generally, our findings highlight the potential for regulation to undermine market discipline in regulated industries.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the degree of portfolio inefficiency subject to various constraints on portfolio weights. When portfolio weights are unconstrained, the posterior loss in expected return on the NYSE-AMEX market portfolio is over 20% (annualized). In contrast, when portfolio weights are constrained to be nonnegative, the posterior loss in expected return is only about 4% (annualized). In addition, short-sale constraints greatly reduce uncertainty in inferences about portfolio efficiency.",
