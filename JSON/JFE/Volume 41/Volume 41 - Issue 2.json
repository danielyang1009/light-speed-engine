            "abstract": "This paper studies the relation between the premiums in takeover bids involving exchange-listed target firms from 1975-91 and the pre-announcement stock price runups. The evidence shows that the pre-bid runup and the post-announcement increase in the target's stock price (the \u2018markup\u2019) are generally uncorrelated. With little substitution between the runup and the markup, the runup is an added cost to the bidder. This finding has important implications for assessing the costs of insider trading. It also raises interesting questions about the role of information from public capital markets in private takeover negotiations.",

            "abstract": "We study industry-level patterns in takeover and restructuring activity during the 1982\u20131989 period. Across 51 industries, we find significant differences in both the rate and time-series clustering of these activities. The interindustry patterns in the rate of takeovers and restructurings are directly related to the economic shocks borne by the sample industries. These results support the argument that much of the takeover activity during the 1980s was driven by broad fundamental factors and have general implications for the stock price spillover effects of takeover announcements, corporate performance following takeovers, and the timing of takeover waves.",

            "abstract": "We present the first empirical evidence on the pricing of convertible debt offerings. Using a sample of 91 convertible debt offerings from the period 1988\u20131992, we show a significant mean initial excess return of 1.11%. Our underpricing result is invariant to zero/nonzero coupons, maturity, issue size, or bond ratings. Further analysis reveals that various types of risk inherent in the new convertible issues are useful in explaining the cross-sectional variation in the initial excess returns. We offer an explanation for our results based on the arguments of the differential information model.",

            "abstract": "This paper re-examines the efficiency of foreign currency futures markets by evaluating the role of time-varying risk premia and volatility in explaining technical trading rule profits. The results show that large parts of the technical rule profits can be explained by the time-varying risk premia estimated from a general model for the conditional CAPM; The bootstrap distributions for the profits under the null model average one-third to one-half of the actual profits and enclose the actual profits well within the 90% confidence intervals. Time-varying conditional volatility explains an additional 10% of the profits.",

            "abstract": "We develop an explanation for IPO underpricing in which the issuer's demand for ownership dispersion creates an incentive to underprice. Promoting oversubscription allows broad initial ownership, which in turn increases secondary-market liquidity. Increased liquidity reduces the required return to investors. Broad initial ownership, however, requires an increase in investor-borne information costs. These information costs are offset through initial underpricing. Empirical results are consistent with initial underpricing reflecting the level of ownership dispersion.",
