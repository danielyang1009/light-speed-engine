The evidence indicates that corporate takeovers generate positive gains, that target firm shareholders benefit, and that bidding firm shareholders do not lose. The gains created by corporate takeovers do not appear to come from the creation of market power. With the exception of actions that exclude potential bidders, it is difficult to find managerial actions related to corporate control that harm shareholders. Finally, we argue the market for corporate control is best viewed as an arena in which managerial teams compete for the rights to manage corporate resources.",

Abnormal stock returns are examined throughout the entire merger process for both successful and unsuccessful merger bids. The evidence shows that increases in the probability of merger benefit the stockholders of target firms, and that decreases in the probability of merger harm the stockholders of both target and bidding firms. There is also evidence that the stock market forecasts probable merger targets in advance of any merger announcement, and because of this, previous studies have underestimated the market's reaction to merger bids.",

Based on a sample of conglomerate acquirers, we find significantly positive abnormal performance associated with the announcement of acquisitions programs and significantly negative performance associated with certain institutional changes of 1967\u20131970 relating to acquisition activity (the Williams Amendments, the 1969 Tax Reform Act, and APB Opinions 16 and 17). Our results support the hypotheses that acquisitions activity had a favorable ex ante impact on the value of firms announcing an intention to engage in acquisitions, and that some of the institutional changes reduced the expected profitability of future acquisitions activity. The basic results of studies of mergers and tender offers are reviewed and their consistency with our findings highlighted.",

Bidding firms gain significantly during the twenty-one days leading to the announcement of each of their first four merger bids. These results fail to support the capitalization hypothesis that bidders' gains are captured at the beginning of merger programs. Bidders' abnormal returns are positively related to the relative size of the merger partners, and the gains during the announcement period are larger for mergers which are successful. Though the gains are larger prior to 1969, merger bids after 1969 also significantly increase the wealth of bidding firms' shareholders. The results suggest that the inconclusive findings of the earlier studies may be due to methodological deficiencies. The findings of this study are consistent with value-maximizing behavior by the management of bidding firms.",

            "abstract": "Several studies of mergers and tender offers examine the changes in the value of ownership claims associated with corporate acquisitions and use the observed value changes to address the degree of competition in the market for corporate acquisitions. These studies conclude that the takeover market is competitive on the basis of the abnormal stock price changes of bidding firms, the time series behavior of the market value of target firms, and the proportion of gains that accrue to target and bidding firms. Unfortunately, none of these tests are sufficient to conclude that the takeover market is competitive. A competitive acquisition market implies that the potential gain to unsuccessful bidders at the successful offer price is nonpositive. This implication is tested using data on tender offers in which there are multiple bidders. The results appear to be consistent with competition in the market for corporate acquisitions.",

The appropriate measure of the wealth effect is shown to be the abnormal dollar return cumulated over time. Using this measure, the long-run wealth effect of the event sequence culminating in merger is significantly negative for acquiring firms. For acquired firms, the effect is negative, but not significant. The immediate impact of merger per se is positive and highly significant for acquired firms but larger in absolute value, and negative for acquiring firms. The evidence also reveals that measured abnormal rates of return to acquiring firms are sensitive to a slight variation in model specification and dependent on firm size, with smaller firms earning significantly negative post-merger returns.",

Our results suggest that the permanent positive revaluation of the unsuccessful target shares [documented by Dodd and Ruback (1977) and Bradley (1980)] is due primarily to the emergence of and/or the anticipation of another bid that would ultimately result in the transfer of control of the target resources. We also find that the rejection of a tender offer has differential effects on the share prices of the unsuccessful bidding firms depending upon whether the tender offer process results in a change in the control of target resources. On the basis of these results we conclude that acquisitions via tender offers are attempts by bidding firms to exploit potential synergies, not simply superior information regarding the \u2018true\u2019 value of the target resources.",

Previous research on this subject suggests that defendants' case-related losses are due entirely to legal expenses and the disruption of productive activity. In this paper it is shown that two out of five portfolios of defendant firms earn abnormal losses when final decisions in antimerger cases are announced. These losses are consistent with the imposition of costly constraints on some defendants by government antitrust enforcers. The tests also show that when acquisitions are canceled following antimerger complaints, the losses to the target firms are substantial and completely offset the gains generated when the acquisitions are proposed.",

Higher product prices, however, imply increased profits for rivals to the merging firms. Therefore, if a horizontal merger is to reduce consumer welfare, rival firms must rise in value at the time of events increasing the probability of the merger and fall in value when the probability of the merger declines. this paper uses daily stock return data from a sample of rivals to 11 horizontal mergers attempted between 1964 and 1972 that were challenged by the antitrust enforcement agencies. The paper tests the hypothesis that, but for the government's action, these mergers would have resulted in higher product prices. On balance, the data favor the null hypothesis of no anticompetitive effect.",

            "abstract": "This paper tests the hypothesis that horizontal mergers generate positive abnormal returns to stockholders of the bidder and target firms because they increase the probability of successful collusion among rival producers. Under the collusion hypothesis, rivals of the merging firms benefit from the merger since successful collusion limits output and raises product prices and/or lower factor prices. This proposition is tested on a large sample of horizontal mergers in mining and manufacturing industries, including mergers challenged by the government with violating antitrust laws, and a \u2018control\u2019 sample of vertical mergers taking place in the same industries. While we find that the antitrust law enforcement agencies systematically select relatively profitable mergers for prosecution, there is little evidence indicating that the mergers would have had collusive, anticompetitive effects.",

Standstills and premium buybacks reduce competition for corporate control and provide differential treatment of large block stockholders. The analysis indicates a statistically significant negative average effect on non-participating stockholder wealth associated with standstill agreements. Negotiated premium repurchases are also associated with negative, but less significant, stockholder returns.

Repurchases at a premium from insiders and small shareholders increase the wealth of non-participating stockholders and are therefore consistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis. However, privately negotiated repurchases of single blocks from stockholders unaffiliated with the firm reduce the wealth of non-participating stockholders. In contrast to the evidence for general repurchases, no positive wealth effect offsets the significant repurchase premium paid to the selling stockholder. Indeed, the wealth loss to non-participating stockholders is significantly greater than the premium paid. This evidence is inconsistent with the shareholders' interest hypothesis and supports the hypothesis that managers in their self-interest use single block repurchases to eliminate threats to their control over the firm's resources.",

In one view, antitakeover provisions are adopted because incumbent management seeks job protection at stockholders' expense. The alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover provisions benefit stockholders, perhaps by extracting greater payment in exchange for corporate control. Although inconclusive, the evidence provides weak preliminary support for the hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are best explained as a device for managerial entrenchment.",

Dissident shareholders usually fail to obtain a majority of board seats. Nevertheless, they capture some seats, via mechanisms such as cumulative voting, in over half of the sample contests. Regardless of proxy contest outcome, positive and statistically significant share price performance is associated with the contest. That finding is predicted by the standard economic analysis of proxy contests, in which the challenges benefit shareholders by improving corporate performance. The finding runs counter to the claim of Berle (1962) that the economists' view of proxy contests is \u2018a wholly imaginary picture\u2019. A portion of the positive share price changes taking place in the early stages of some proxy contests is not permanent, however, and as suggested by Manne (1962) is at least partially attributable to temporary increases in the market value of the vote attached to corporate shares.",
