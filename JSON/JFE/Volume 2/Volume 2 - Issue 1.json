            "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on the benefits to investors, arising out of the integration of the capital markets of different countries. The notion that an expansion in the opportunity set of individual investors causes improvements in their welfare is analyzed to take account of the effects on their wealth. With the supplies of investments held constant, the effects of changes in the macroparameters of the risk-return pricing relationship, caused by the merger of capital markets, on the wealth of individuals in the new equilibrium, are determined. Using three specific utility functions \u2013 quadratic, exponential and logarithmic \u2013 it is shown that international capital market integration is Pareto-optimal, i.e., the welfare of individuals in the economies considered never declines, and will generally improve. The effect of expansion of the opportunity set, due to the integration of capital markets, nullifies the effect of a possible negative change in wealth.",

            "abstract": "Following a report of a possible seasonal in Australian share prices [Praetz (1973)], a study was made of the behaviour of share returns using different data and methodology to that of the original report. The test included forecasts of the seasonal using Box and Jenkins methods. Although the results indicate some evidence of a seasonal, it is shown that this is not prima facie evidence of market inefficiency. It is suggested that a more likely explanation is related to the structure of the economy, e.g., changing opportunity cost of money through the year.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of information and its effect on social welfare. Information is defined to be more accurate than the existing information if individuals are willing to revise their subjective, homogeneous beliefs based on the new information. In a pure exchange economy where individuals may differ in endowments and tastes, it is shown that, for all utility functions satisfying risk aversion and non-satiation, the receipt of more accurate information does not increase social welfare (in terms of ex-ante Pareto-optimality) even when such information production is costless. This represents a more rigorous analysis on several issues that are not clear in the Marshall (1974) paper. Using the HARA class of utility functions, this paper also addresses the relationship between information and borrowing and lending, and the effect of information on the risk-free rate of interest.",

Then, the impact of uncertainty on the spread is empirically tested. The hypothesis that the spread varies inversely with the number of bidders for an issue is also developed and tested, and several other hypothesized determinants of the spread are examined.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we obtain the optimal selection rule for ordering uncertain prospects for all individuals with decreasing absolute risk averse utility functions. The optimal selection rule minimizes the admissible set of alternatives by discarding, from among a given set of alternatives, those that are inferior (for each utility function in the restricted class) to a member of the given set. We show that the Third Order Stochastic Dominance (TSD) rule is the optimal rule when comparing uncertain prospects with equal means. We also show that in the general case of unequal means, no known selection rule uses both necessary and sufficient conditions for dominance, and the TSD rule may be used to obtain a reasonable approximation to the smallest admissible set. The TSD rule is complex and we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the TSD admissible set. For certain restrictive classes of the probability distributions (of returns on uncertain prospects) which cover most commonly used distributions in finance and economics, we obtain the optimal rule and show that it reduces to a simple form. We also study the relationship of the optimal selection rule to others previously advocated in the literature, including the more popular mean-variance rule as well as the semi-variance rule.",
