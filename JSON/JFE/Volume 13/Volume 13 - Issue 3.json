            "abstract": "Tax considerations governing bondholders' optimal trading include: capital loss realization; capital gain deferment; change of the long-term holding period status to short-term by sale of the bond and repurchase, to realize future losses short-term; raising the basis above par by sale of the bond and repurchase, to deduct the amortized premium from ordinary income. The optimal policy which incorporates transactions costs and conforms to the IRS code substantially differs from the buy-and-hold and continuous-realization policies. Failure to account for optimal trading may seriously bias econometric estimation of the yield curve and the tax bracket of the marginal bondholders.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines one of the few cases of seemingly redundant securities: sets of three government bonds with the same maturity date. Within the bounds on relative bond prices established by tax-exempt investors in a market with proportional transaction costs, the taxation of capital gains on the basis of realization has a significant impact on relative prices. The empirical evidence supports the tax option effect discussed by Constantinides and Ingersoll, but does not generally support the segmented tax-clientele equilibrium discussed by Schaefer.",

            "abstract": "The quality option implicit in futures contracts allows the short position to satisfy the contract by delivering one of a variety of specified assets. If, at the time the contract is purchased, knowledge of which of the allowed assets will be cheapest at maturity is uncertain, then the quality option will have value. The greater the value of this option, the lower will be the futures price. This paper presents, and tests, a futures pricing model that incorporates the quality option aspect of commodity futures contracts. Our research shows that the quality option has a significant impact on futures prices.",

            "abstract": "We develop a theory of warrants held by competitive warrantholders not constrained to exercise their warrants as one block; the theory also applies to convertible bonds held by competitive bondholders not constrained to convert their bonds as one block. We prove that the warrant (bond) price in each of the competitive equilibria is less than or equal to the price in an economy with the block constraint; and for at least one competitive equilibrium the warrant (bond) price equals the warrant (bond) price in the block-constrained economy. We illustrate the paths of competitive warrant exercise and bond conversion and conclude that under realistic assumptions they can be long.",

            "abstract": "Unlike most securities, the pricing of sinking fund bonds is influenced by the distribution of ownership, which summarizes the extent to which the market is cornered. The effect of the distribution of ownership on the pricing of sinking fund bonds is examined by an explicit game in which the price obtained for bonds sold can depend upon the size of the investor's position. This framework is used to contrast the valuation of sinking fund bonds with the valuation of amortizing bonds and straight debt. We show that it is generally incorrect to view sinking fund bonds as being equivalent to serial bonds.",

In deriving his results, Merton made restrictive assumptions about the way the market prices payoff distributions, and used the Rothschild-Stiglitz (1970) measure to compare the riskiness of securities. I show by means of an example that the Merton result will not in general be true. I then derive a sufficient condition for the option on one stock to have higher market value than the option on another stock, when both the stocks have the same price, and explain why the Merton result is valid in the Black-Scholes environment.",

There were no transactions on nearly 25% of the days for the smallest decile even at the turn of year which is an active trading period for small companies. As a result of low levels of trading and the regulations governing exchange specialists, transaction prices and quotations of small listed companies may require several days to fully reflect equilibrium price changes. The data confirm the existence of a year-end seasonal pattern in rates of return for small companies and suggest that there may be a seasonal pattern for large companies as well.",
