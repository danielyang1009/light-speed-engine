            "abstract": "We derive and test an alternative closed-form general equilibrium model of the term structure within the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross theoretical framework in which yields are nonlinear functions of the risk-free rate. We show that equilibrium bond prices and the risk-free rate are not always inversely related and that bond risk need not be strictly increasing in maturity. Using Hansen's generalized method of moments to obtain parameter estimates, this nonlinear model outperforms the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross square root model in describing actual Treasury bill yields for the 1964\u20131986 period.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of over 1,800 U.K. takeovers on shareholder wealth in the period 1955\u20131985. It shows that around the merger announcement date targets gain 25 to 30 percent and bidders earn zero or modest gains. The U.K. data allow independent tests of many issues addressed in studies of U.S. takeovers. Target gains are higher in the U.K. after 1968, suggesting that increases in U.S. target gains at the same time may not be attributable to the Williams Act. Postmerger share-price performance suggests that acquisitions follow favorable developments in bidder's equity prices.",

Our empirical results are consistent with the model. Specifically we find that the unseasoned new issues' anomaly disappears when the rationing associated with new issues is incorporated into the analysis. The winner's curse is evident in allocation patterns used in Singapore.",

Delaying the call benefits the firm if enough investors are expected to delay their voluntary conversions. Consistent with this theory, we document that a substantial number of investors do not voluntarily convert when the common dividend exceeds the convertible's dividend plus its premium over conversion value. We find that firms would not have increased common stock returns by switching to the strategy of calling to force conversion as soon as possible. Surprisingly, we find that convertible preferreds frequently sell below conversion value.",

This paper develops a model consistent with this observation, which assumes the firm itself best knows its prospects. In certain circumstances, firms with the most favorable prospects find it optimal to signal their type by underpricing their initial issue of shares, and investors know that only the best can recoup the cost of this signal from subsequent issues.",

            "abstract": "Latent variable tests of asset pricing models make assumptions about the joint distribution of observable returns and unobservable benchmark returns. These tests can falsely accept models when a mean-variance efficient portfolio other than the benchmark satisfies the distributional assumptions imposed on the benchmark portfolio. Also, because the assumptions are untestable, there is no way to discover whether a model is being rejected because the assumptions are false. Without these assumptions, however, latent variable tests can be viewed only as tests of distributional hypotheses about mean-variance efficient portfolios of unknown composition.",

We conclude that exercise behavior is generally rational, but document numerous failures to exercise as well as some exercises that should not have occured, both at and prior to expiration. The most frequent type of error is failing to exercise, suggesting that traders do not monitor their positions with sufficient care. Finally, we show that investors use information arriving after trading closes, but before exchange-imposed exercise deadlines, in forming their exercise decisions.",

Since the inception of trading in September 1986, the NSA futures contract has generally sold at a discount relative to its theoretical value. Trading restrictions and transaction costs may explain some of this mispricing, which has been declining over time, as in the U.S. markets.",
