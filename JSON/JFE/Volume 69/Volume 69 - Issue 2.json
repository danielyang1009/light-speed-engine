            "abstract": "Expected discounting in seasoned equity offers is a cost of uncertainty about firm value, marketing new shares, and acquiring information that raises the offer price. Stockholders incorporate predictable discounting in stock prices when equity offers are first announced. The surprise component of discounting, reflecting the lead bank's final adjustment to the offer price, releases information that often causes economically large price swings on the offer day. Disparities between the issuer's closing price and the price suggested in the lead bank's final order book are a primary source of information. The discount surprise appears to be used by lead banks to update capital suppliers with that eleventh-hour information before they commit their funds.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates whether dealer firms\u2019 trading and pricing decisions are governed by their equivalent inventories, based on Ho and Stoll (1983) or Froot and Stein (1998), or by their ordinary inventories. It finds that ordinary inventories best explain dealer firms\u2019 quote placement strategy, which dealer firm executes trades, and the quality of execution offered to the trades. This finding is consistent with decentralized nature of market-making where individual dealers focus on the position risk of stocks managed by them and not the position risks of stocks managed by other dealers in the firm.",

            "abstract": "This paper shows that the book-to-market (B/M) effect is greater for stocks with higher idiosyncratic return volatility, higher transaction costs, and lower investor sophistication, consistent with the market-mispricing explanation for the anomaly. The B/M effect for high volatility stocks exceeds that for the low volatility stocks in 20 of the 22 sample years. Also, volatility exhibits significant incremental power beyond transaction costs and investor sophistication measures in explaining cross-sectional variation in the B/M effect. These findings are consistent with the Shleifer and Vishny (1997) thesis that risk associated with the volatility of arbitrage returns deters arbitrage activity and is an important reason why the B/M effect exists.",

            "abstract": "Using proprietary audit trail transaction data compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we investigate at the individual trader level (1) the timing and (2) the determinants of dual traders\u2019 personal trades. Our analysis reveals an absence of any trade timing by dual traders in relation to the execution of their customers\u2019 orders. Further examination employing correlation statistics and time series regressions provides strong support for the proposition that dual traders supply liquidity and actively manage inventory. Even after simultaneously controlling for factors representing information, liquidity supply, and inventory control, within a multivariate regression framework, liquidity supply and inventory control remain as the determinants of dual traders\u2019 personal trades. Overall, the emergent profile of a dual trader is that of an uninformed trader performing complimentary tasks.",
