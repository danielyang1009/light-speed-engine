            "abstract": "Pacific Lumber was acquired in 1986 by MAXXAM, whose decision to double PL's harvest of old-growth redwoods precipitated 11 years of environmental protests. Intense media coverage blames the Drexel-financed takeover for threatening Headwaters Forest, the largest privately owned ancient redwood forest. This \u2018Wall Street greed\u2019 portrayal aroused such public outrage that the Clinton administration agreed to pay $380 million for Headwaters weeks before the 1996 election. We establish that the threat to Head-waters is not attributable to MAXXAM's junk bond-financed takeover. Government's response to dramatic crises encourages interest groups to use emotional appeals to influence resource allocation.",

            "abstract": "We develop a framework for analyzing the capital allocation and capital structure decisions facing financial institutions. Our model incorporates two key features: (i) value-maximizing banks have a well-founded concern with risk management; and (ii) not all the risks they face can be frictionlessly hedged in the capital market. This approach allows us to show how bank-level risk management considerations should factor into the pricing of those risks that cannot be easily hedged. We examine several applications, including: the evaluation of proprietary trading operations, and the pricing of unhedgeable derivatives positions. We also compare our approach to the RAROC methodology that has been adopted by a number of banks.",

            "abstract": "This paper contends that corporations use callable, convertible bonds to lower the issuance costs of sequential financing. Sequential financing increases issue costs but helps control overinvestment incentives that can arise if financing is provided prior to an investment option's maturity. A convertible bond's conversion option reduces issue costs while helping to control the overinvestment incentive. Evidence of important investment and financing activity around the time convertible bonds are called and converted supports the hypothesis. The evidence shows significant increases in capital expenditures and new long-term debt financing starting in the year of the call.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the relation among ownership structure, investment, and corporate value, focusing on whether ownership structure affects investment. Ordinary least squares regression results suggest that ownership structure affects investment and, therefore, corporate value. However, simultaneous regression results indicate that the endogeneity of ownership may affect these inferences, suggesting that investment affects corporate value which, in turn, affects ownership structure. The evidence shows that corporate value affects ownership structure, but not vice versa. These findings raise questions regarding the assumption that ownership structure is exogenously determined, and bring into question the results in studies that treat ownership structure as exogenous.",
