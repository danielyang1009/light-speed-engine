            "abstract": "This study does not support the view that a large number of shares can be sold at the prevailing market price and at a small cost. A significant stock price decrease is observed at the initial announcement of secondary distributions. The price declines are greater for offerings by officers and directors and for larger offerings, but are significant for all types of sellers and for large and small offerings. There is no significant price decline at the offering when secondaries are announced in advance. Underwriting and other selling costs are substantial and are positively related to relative offering size.",

            "abstract": "Financial economists are interested in whether alternative compensation plans are adopted primarily for tax, incentive or signaling reasons. As most compensation plans have tax implications, examining for other effects is difficult. In this paper we examine the stock market reaction to employee stock purchase plans which are \u2018non-tax advantageous\u2019 and adopted for incentive/signaling reasons. The results suggest that (1) equity-based compensation schemes have a positive effect on shareholder wealth for reasons other than tax reduction, (2) a motive for adopting these plans is to align managerial and shareholder interests, and (3) equity ownership motivates key executives more than subordinate employees.",

            "abstract": "When the assumption of constant risk premiums is relaxed, financial valuation models may be tested, and risk measures estimated without specifying a market index or state variables. This is accomplished by examining the behavior of conditional expected returns. The approach is developed using a single risk premium asset pricing model as an example and then extended to models with multiple risk premiums. The methodology is illustrated using daily return data on the common stocks of the Dow Jones 30. The tests indicate that these returns are consistent with a single, time-varying risk premium.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a model of stock price reactions to partially anticipated events. The model formalizes the intuition that stock price reactions reflect both the economic importance of events and the extent to which events are surprises. Unbiased estimates of the economic importance of partially anticipated events must combine stock price reactions to events with stock price movements in periods when no event occurs. The model is used to estimate the value of acquisition attempts made by frequently acquiring firms. For a sample of thirty active acquirers, the evidence indicates that acquisition attempts were profitable investment projects.",

The evidence demonstrates rather unambiguously that there is, on the average, an approximately 30% \u2018arbitrary\u2019 increase in the return standard deviations following the ex-date. The increase holds for both daily and weekly data, and it is not temporary. No explanatory confounding variables, such as institutional frictions affecting price observations, have been identified. We view the findings as being essentially inconsistent with the notion of \u2018rational pricing\u2019.",

Their hypothesis is dependent upon individuals utilizing existing provisions of the Code which serve to reduce the taxation of dividends. In this study, estimates of the marginal and effective rates of tax on dividend income for the year 1979 are presented using the Statistics of Income sample of returns. The average marginal rate of tax on dividend income is estimated to be 40%, while the average effective rate of tax is estimated to be 30%.",

Additional properties of the solution are derived numerically.",

However, the concept finds application in option pricing theory also. This article shows that if options are valued by the Black (1976) formula and a comparative-statics methodology is employed, then the interest rate sensitivity of a portfolio of European options is equal to its duration. If the options are instead valued through the Black-Scholes (1973) formula, then the interest rate sensitivity is equal to only the \u2018bond-equivalent duration\u2019 inherent in a dynamic replication strategy for the option portfolio.",
