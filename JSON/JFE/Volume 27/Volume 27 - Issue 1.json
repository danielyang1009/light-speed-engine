            "abstract": "Law and politics affect the financial structure of the public corporation, perhaps as much as economics. Law restricts financial institutions from holding large equity blocks and from networking the small blocks they do own. Impetus for these restrictions came from several sources: a public-spirited belief that financial stability would be fostered by financial fragmentation, American federalism (each state created its own insular set of financial institutions), rivalries between groups of financial institutions, and popular mistrust of powerful private financial institutions. The stability of many of these rules also derives from the political resistance that one would expect corporate managers and benefited financial institutions to offer to any change.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the agency problem between shareholders and debtholders of Japanese and U.S. firms. Whereas U.S. institutional investors are restricted from doing so, Japanese financial institutions take large equity positions in firms to which they lend, particularly in firms more susceptible to the agency problem. Debt ratios of U.S. firms are negatively related to the firm's potential to engage in risky, suboptimal investments, whereas Japanese debt ratios show no such relation. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the agency problem is mitigated to a greater degree in Japan than in the U.S.",

We present evidence that Japanese firms with financial structures in which these problems are likely to be small perform better than other firms after the onset of distress. In particular, we show that firms in industrial groups \u2014 those with close financial relationships to their banks, suppliers, and customers \u2014 invest more and sell more after the onset of distress than nongroup firms. We find similar results for nongroup firms that nevertheless have strong ties to a main bank.",

            "abstract": "To economists, agency problems present challenges that can be resolved through optimal contracting or incentive mechanisms. To politicians, agency problems represent entitlements to be allocated among favored constituencies. Corporate management constitutes a powerful constituency independent of the interests of workers, local communities, and other corporate stakeholders. The political process has, for politically rational but economically dabatable reasons, systematically subordinated investors' desire to resolve agency problems to managers' desire to be protected from capital-market discipline. Politically explicit modes of analysis thus complement traditional tools of finance theory and improve our ability to explain capital-market structure and behavior.",

During the 1980s the company reversed the extensive diversification of the two preceding decades by returning to its traditional core of packaged foods and food-related services. Drawing extensively on field interviews with the parties directly involved in the decision process, the paper explains the rationale behind both the structuring and the restructuring process. It highlights the role of the internal corporate governance process, the internal and external forces for change, and the consequences for financial performance and shareholder value.",

Operating returns increase significantly from the year before to the year after buyouts as measured by operating cash flows (before interest and taxes) per employee and per dollar of operating assets. Subsequent changes in operating returns suggest that this increase is sustained. Adjustments in the management of working capital contribute to the increase in operating returns. The increase is not, however, the result of layoffs or reductions in expenditures for advertising, maintenance and repairs, research and development, or property, plant, and equipment.",

LBOs (particularly MBOs) that occured during 1983\u20131986 had a strong positive effect on TFP in the first three post-buyout years: plant productivity increased from 2.0% above industry mean in the three pre-buyout years to 8.3% above industry mean in the three post-buyout years. However, 1981 and 1982 buyouts had no significant productivity effect. The employment and compensation of white-collar workers decline following buyouts, but those of blue-collar workers are unchanged.",

Bonds with strong covenant protection, however, gain value, while those with no protection lose value. The disposition of bonds after buyouts, e.g., remained outstanding, called, tendered, defeased, is also strongly linked to type of covenant protection. We also document that covenant use declines for bonds issued after 1980. Finally, the losses to bondholders are small compared with the gains accruing to shareholders.",

We calculate this risk as a function of the difference in systematic equity risk before and after the recapitalization. The increase in equity risk is surprisingly small after a recapitalization, ranging from 37% to 57%, depending on the estimation method. If total company risk is unchanged, the implied systematic risk of the post-recapitalization debt in twelve transactions averages 0.65. Alternatively, if the entire market-adjusted premium in the leveraged recapitalization represents a reduction in fixed costs, the implied systematic risk of this debt averages 0.40.",

There is little evidence that buyouts lead to widespread employee layoffs, wage reductions, or wealth transfers from bondholders. LBOs continue to be controversial, however. Future research should focus on the effect of buyouts on firms' strategic investments, buyout firms' performance under difficult economic conditions, and the frequency and costs of financial distress associated with buyouts. Research can also focus on improving the performance of public corporations by examining the individual contributions of debt, management ownership, and corporate governance changes to podt-buyout performance.",

Point estimates imply that union wealth changes in the six years following the acquisition account for 1% to 2% of shareholder premiums. This figure rises to 5% over 18 years. For hostile takeovers, union wealth increases by roughly 3% and 10% of shareholder gains over 6- and 18-year periods. The 95% confidence interval for wage changes implies that unions may lose up to a quarter, or gain up to a fifth, of what target shareholders gain.",
