            "abstract": "This paper investigates trading volume around ex-dividend days. For taxable distributions (cash dividends), it is found that trading volume increases significantly around the ex-dividend day. This increase is more pronounced for high yield, actively traded stocks and after brokerage commissions became negotiable. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that short-term traders have an impact on ex-day price behavior, at least for taxable distributions. For non-taxable distributions (stock splits and stock dividends) we find negative abnormal volume around ex-day.",

            "abstract": "A two-factor model using the instantaneous rate of interest and the return on a consol bond to describe the term structure of interest rates \u2014 the Brennan-Schwartz model \u2014 is used to derive theoretical prices for American call and put options on US government bonds and treasury bills. These model prices are then compared with market prices. The theoretical model used to value the dept options also provides hedge ratios which may be used to construct zero-investment portfolios which, in theory, are perfectly riskless. Several trading strategies based on these \u2018riskless\u2019 portfolios are examined.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes how access to deposit insurance affects the common stock returns of financial institutions during periods of financial distress. During periods of distress the definition of insolvency used by insuring agencies may be modified to avoid a substantial number of bank failures. These modifications can increase the value of future deposit guarantees and affect the behavior of stock returns of banks and S&Ls. This hypothesis is examined using S&L data for the 1976 through 1983 period. Modification of insolvency rules applied to S&Ls appears to have reduced significantly the co-movement of S&L stock returns with S&L portfolio holdings.",

            "abstract": "This paper contains a test of a new aspect of the informational content of dividend; namely, is there information in the timing of the announcements? The empirical evidence indicates that the market expects \u2018bad news\u2019 to be delivered late and that these expectations are confirmed. Mean excess returns of stock prices around late announcements are, depending on the assumed returns generating process, either significantly negative or insignificant while significantly positive around the entire population of announcements. Moreover, the proportion and magnitude of dividend reductions associated with late announcements are significantly larger than in the complete universe of announcements.",

When production functions are concave, markets are complete, and future production possibilities are the same irrespective of which state of the world occurs, the term structure premium will be positive. In incomplete markets, constant or increasing absolute risk aversion is sufficient to guarantee a positive term structure premium, although in the (more likely) case of decreasing absolute risk aversion a negative premium cannot be ruled out.",
