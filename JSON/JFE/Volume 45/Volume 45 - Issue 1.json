            "abstract": "This special issue of the Journal of Financial Economics includes six articles that analyze the market microstructure of Nasdaq in various ways. The question of the costs of trading on Nasdaq has become contentious in both the academic and legal/regulatory arenas since the Christie and Schultz (1994) article first noted that many actively traded Nasdaq stocks were almost never quoted on odd eights. The articles in this symposium bring new and interesting insights to this debate.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates relations between trade execution costs and price-rounding practices for NYSE- and Nasdaq-listed firms. Execution costs on each exchange vary positively with the proportion of transaction prices and quotations rounded to eveneights of a dollar, both cross-sectionally and intertemporally. After allowing for variation in market-making costs attributable to the private information content of trades, there is a strong positive relation between execution costs and price-rounding frequencies for Nasdaq issues but not for NYSE issues. These findings are consistent with the assertion that price-rounding conventions effectively increase trade execution costs on Nasdaq.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines 472 securities that were listed on Nasdaq and moved to the NYSE or Amex. When Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighth quotes, bid-ask spreads are large and decline dramatically with exchange listing. When market makers use both odd and even eighths, spreads are smaller and decline only slightly with exchange listing. The large spreads observed when Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighths cannot be explained by security-specific characteristics. Instead, the results support the conclusion that the avoidance of odd-eighth quotes is used as a coordination device among Nasdaq market makers to maintain supra-competitive bid-ask spreads.",

            "abstract": "Because of its institutional features, the Nasdaq market does not fit the standard competitive model. We construct a model that reflects the distinguishing characteristics of the Nasdaq market. This model implies that in dealer markets with a minimum price increment, competition among market-makers does not necessarily drive spreads down to the level of marginal cost. Using this result, we provide an explanation for the odd-eighth avoidance documented in Christie and Schultz (1994). We show that market-makers can use odd-tick avoidance as a coordination device to increase spreads. Evidence from Nasdaq supports our hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Different methods are used by the NYSE/Amex and the Nasdaq to accomodate limit orders received from investors. This accounts for at least part of the excess of Nasdaq spreads over NYSE spreads, adjusted for trading volume, and is a factor in determining this excess that is independent of collusion on the Nasdaq. The spread-comparison evidence given by others to support their belief that there is collusion among market makers on the Nasdaq therefore overstates the probability of collusion and its significance if it exists.",

Several studies have attempted to measure these differences by comparing bid-ask spreads. This paper uses an alternative approach to compare liquidity. We analyze three issues: (1) the frequencies of the sizes and types of block trades found in the two markets, (2) the immediate price effects of the block transactions, and (3) the temporary and permanent price effects of the blocks. We find evidence that the NYSE system provides more liquidity for block transactions.",

We examine trading in the 20 largest Nasdaq stocks around the time of a rule change that reduced the largest SOES trades from 1000 to 500 shares. We show that SOES trades contain information about short-term price movements and that SOES trading declined dramatically with the rule change. However, quoted and effective spreads were unaffected by the rule change.",
