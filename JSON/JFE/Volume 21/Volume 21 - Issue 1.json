We also provide a theoretical analysis of the process of competition for control of the target and empirical evidence that competition among bidding firms increases the returns to targets and decreases the returns to acquirers, that the supply of target shares is positively sloped, and that changes in the legal/institutional environment of tender offers have had no impact on the total (percentage) synergistic gains created but have significantly affected their division between the stockholders of the target and acquiring firms.",

            "abstract": "Term-structure models from Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) imply that conditional expected discrete-period returns on discount instruments are linear functions of forward rates. Tests reject a single-latent-variable model of expected returns on U.S. Treasury bills, but two or three latent variables appear to describe expected returns on bills of all maturities. Expected returns estimated using two-latent-variables exhibit variation with business cycles similar to what Fama (1986) observes for forward rates. Inverted term structures precede recessions and upward-sloping structures precede recoveries.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the intraday market response to announcements of new equity issues. For fifteen minutes following the announcement, there is abnormally high volume and a -1.3% average return. There is also a small, but significant, negative average return in the hour before the announcement. Issue size, intended use of proceeds, and estimated profitability of new investment are uncorrelated with the announcement effect. After the issuance of new shares, there is a significant price recovery of 1.5%. This evidence is inconsistent with many theoretical rationales for the negative market reaction to new equity issue announcements.",

            "abstract": "We document a seasonal pattern in stock returns around quarterly earnings announcement dates: small firms show large positive abnormal returns and a sizable increase in the variability of returns around these dates. Only part of the large abnormal returns can be accounted for by the tendency of firms with good news to announce early. Large firms show no abnormal returns around announcement dates and a much smaller increase in variability.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops and implements a technique for estimating a model of the bid/ask spread. The spread is decomposed into two components, one due to asymmetric information and one due to inventory costs, specialist monopoly power, and clearing costs. The model is estimated using NYSE common stock transaction prices in the period 1981\u20131983. Cross-sectional regression analysis is then used to relate time-series estimated spread components to other stock characteristics. The results cannot reject the hypothesis that significant amounts of NYSE common stock spreads are due to asymmetric information.",
