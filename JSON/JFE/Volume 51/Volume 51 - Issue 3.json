            "abstract": "The stated justification for the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) was to eliminate manipulation. The primary evidence of manipulation was the existence of `stock pools,' through which groups of traders jointly traded in a particular stock. The conclusion of Congress that the pools were manipulative is inconsistent with the evidence produced by the Senate's own investigation. The returns on a sample of pool stocks are also inconsistent with manipulation. These findings suggest that congressional and presidential desires to increase political control over the New York Stock Exchange was a more important motivation for the Exchange Act.",

            "abstract": "We find that measures of board and ownership structure explain a significant amount of cross-sectional variation in CEO compensation, after controlling for standard economic determinants of pay. Moreover, the signs of the coefficients on the board and ownership structure variables suggest that CEOs earn greater compensation when governance structures are less effective. We also find that the predicted component of compensation arising from these characteristics of board and ownership structure has a statistically significant negative relation with subsequent firm operating and stock return performance. Overall, our results suggest that firms with weaker governance structures have greater agency problems; that CEOs at firms with greater agency problems receive greater compensation; and that firms with greater agency problems perform worse.",

            "abstract": "We empirically examine the impact of flotation costs, agency conflicts, regulation, and information asymmetries on a firm's mix between public and private debt. Results indicate that firms with larger issue sizes exploit the scale economies in flotation costs of public debt. Firms with higher contracting costs due to moral hazard have higher proportions of private debt. There is only limited support for the adverse selection hypothesis. We find little evidence that firms with favorable private information about future profitability choose more private debt. However, those firms with favorable information about future profitability that also operate under greater information asymmetry rely more on private debt.",

Using a sample of first public straight debt offers, we test the cross-monitoring effect of bank debt and Diamond's (1991, Journal of Political Economy, 99, 689\u2013721) reputation-building argument. We find that the existence of bank debt lowers the at-issue yield spreads for first public straight bond offers by about 68 basis points, on average. Consistent with Diamond's reputation-building argument, we document that firm reputation is negatively related to the at-issue yield spread for initial public debt offers.",

A sample based on the experience of a single issuer allows us to minimize the influence of agency considerations and differential riskiness of the issuers. We find no systematic ex post cost difference, and we also find that negotiation was chosen during comparatively unsettled times.",
