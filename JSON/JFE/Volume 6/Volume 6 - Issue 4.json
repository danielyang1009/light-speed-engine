            "abstract": "We present sufficient conditions for taxable investors to be indifferent to dividends despite tax differentials in favor of capital gains (Strong Invariance Proposition). The conditions include two \u2018seemingly unrelated\u2019 provisions of the Internal Revenue Code: (1) the limitation of interest deductions to investment income received and (2) the tax-free accumulation of wealth at the before-tax interest rate on investments in life insurance. Although we use insurance for simplicity in the proof, many tax-equivalent investment vehicles now exist, notably pension funds. Our analysis suggests that the personal income tax is approaching a consumption tax with further drift likely.",

            "abstract": "This article re-examines the magnitude of stockholder gains from merger. To measure stockholder gains we employ four alternative two-factor market-industry models in combination with a matched non-merging control group. The four two-factor models are based on either the capital asset pricing model or Black's (1972) zero-beta model combined with two alternative industry factors. The four models are shown to produce generally consistent results. However, the results from a two-factor model are sometimes different from the results of a simpler one-factor model. Also, the introduction of a third factor, the non-merging control group, is shown to have a substantial impact on performance measurement.",

The equal weight proxy outperforms the others when the criterion is squared error of conditional prediction of returns. The ex post efficient proxies use maximum likelihood estimates of return. Stein estimates of return will generally be different from the maximum likelihood estimates and they necessarily correspond to market proxies which are not efficient ex post. In other words, there generally exists a better, inefficient, proxy than an ex post efficient proxy when the criterion is squared error of conditional prediction of return.",

The conditions under which an investor holds the market portfolio are explored. In addition the extent to which securities are held in proportions which differ from market weights are shown to be functions of tax rates, dividend policies, and the variance covariance structure between all securities.",
