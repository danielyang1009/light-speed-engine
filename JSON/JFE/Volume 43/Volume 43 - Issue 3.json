            "abstract": "Our simulation results show that tests for long-horizon (i.e.. multi-year) abnormal security returns around firm-specific events are severely misspecified. The rejection frequencies using parametric tests sometimes exceed 30% when the significance level of the test is 5%. Our results are robust to many different abnormal-return models. Conclusions from long-horizon studies require extreme caution. Nonparametric and bootstrap tests are likely to reduce misspecification.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the empirical power and specification of test statistics in event studies designed to detect long-run (one- to five-year) abnormal stock returns. We document that test statistics based on abnormal returns calculated using a reference portfolio, such as a market index, are misspecified (empirical rejection rates exceed theoretical rejection rates) and identify three reasons for this misspecification. We correct for the three identified sources of misspecification by matching sample firms to control firms of similar sizes and book-to-market ratios. This control firm approach yields well-specified test statistics in virtually all sampling situations considered.",

We propose a new empirical to the determination of manager \u2018style\u2019. This approach is simple to apply, yet it captures nonlinear patterns of returns that result from virtually all active portfolio management styles. Our classifications are superior to common industry classifications in predicting cross-sectional future performance, as well as past performance, and they also outperform classifications based on risk measures and analogue portfolios. Interestingly, \u2018growth\u2019 funds typically break down into several categories that differ in composition and strategy.",

            "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of vulture investors in the governance and reorganization of a sample of 288 firms that default on their public debt. The improvement in post-restructuring operating performance relative to the pre-default level is greater when the vulture investor becomes CEO or chairman or gains control of the target firm. We also find positive abnormal returns for the target's common stock and bonds in the two days surrounding the announcement of a vulture purchase of public debt or equity. Our evidence suggests that vulture investors add value by disciplining managers of distressed firms.",

In contrast. equity REIT IPOs in the 1990s have been underpriced. on average by 3.6%. and have moderately outperformed seasoned equity REITs in the 100 trading days after issuance. We attribute the initial-day underpricing of recent REIT IPOs to greater valuation uncertainty and greater institutional involvement in the recent REIT IPO market. Both of these factors make these issues more susceptible to the \u2018winner's curse\u2019.",
