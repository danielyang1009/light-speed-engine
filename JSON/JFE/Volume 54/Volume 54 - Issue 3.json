            "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the value of the right to choose the method of sale of corporate assets. We show that this right is valuable, and that its value comes from recognizing conflicting incentives of claimants at the time of sale. As with risky projects, senior and junior claimants are shown to have distinct preferences on a set of common auction procedures. They also differ on the issue of allocation of resources towards attracting bidders for the auction. As a consequence, the optimal allocation of the design right must depend on circumstances prevailing at the time of the sale. While, in general, selling the firm by auction does not guarantee the use of optimal selling arrangements, a suitable allocation of design rights may help mitigate inefficiency problems significantly.",

            "abstract": "We examine firm debt maturity in 30 countries during the period 1980\u20131991. In countries with active stock markets, large firms have more long-term debt. Stock market activity is not correlated with debt levels of small firms. By contrast, in countries with a large banking sector, small firms have less short-term debt and their debt is of longer maturity. Variation in the size of the banking sector is uncorrelated with the capital structures of large firms. Government subsidies to industry are positively related and inflation is negatively related to the use of long-term debt. We also find evidence of maturity matching.",

            "abstract": "We simulate standard tests of performance persistence using alternative return-generating processes, survival criteria, and test methodologies. When survival depends on performance over several periods, survivorship bias induces spurious reversals, despite the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity in performance. Look-ahead biased methodologies and missing final returns typical of U.S. mutual fund datasets can also materially affect persistence measures. Our results reinforce previous findings that U.S. mutual fund performance is truly persistent. When fund performance is truly persistent, fund attrition affects persistence measures, even when the sample includes all nonsurvivor returns. We also examine the specification and power of the various persistence tests.",

            "abstract": "When a rate of return is regressed on a lagged stochastic regressor, such as a dividend yield, the regression disturbance is correlated with the regressor's innovation. The OLS estimator's finite-sample properties, derived here, can depart substantially from the standard regression setting. Bayesian posterior distributions for the regression parameters are obtained under specifications that differ with respect to (i) prior beliefs about the autocorrelation of the regressor and (ii) whether the initial observation of the regressor is specified as fixed or stochastic. The posteriors differ across such specifications, and asset allocations in the presence of estimation risk exhibit sensitivity to those differences.",

            "abstract": "We show that higher cash flow volatility is associated with lower average levels of investment in capital expenditures, R&D, and advertising. This association suggests that firms do not use external capital markets to fully cover cash flow shortfalls but rather permanently forgo investment. Cash flow volatility also is associated with higher costs of accessing external capital. Moreover, these higher costs, as measured by some proxies, imply a greater sensitivity of investment to cash flow volatility. Thus, cash flow volatility not only increases the likelihood that a firm will need to access capital markets, it also increases the costs of doing so.",
