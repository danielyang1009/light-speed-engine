            "abstract": "When the price process for a long-lived asset is of a mixed jump\u2013diffusion type, pricing of options on that asset by arbitrage is not possible if trading is allowed only in the underlying asset and a riskless bond. Using a general equilibrium framework, we derive and analyze option prices when the underlying asset is the market portfolio with discontinuous returns. The premium for the risk of jumps and the diffusion risk forms a significant part of the prices of the options. In this economy, an attempted replication of call and put options by the Black\u2013Scholes type of trading strategies may require substantial infusion of funds when jumps occur. We study the cost and risk implications of such dynamic hedging plans.",

            "abstract": "This article generalizes the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial option-pricing model, and establishes a convergence from discrete-time multivariate multinomial models to continuous-time multidimensional diffusion models for contingent claims prices. The key to the approach is to approximate the |$N$|-dimensional diffusion price process by a sequence of |$N$|-variate, |$(N+1)$|-nomial processes. It is shown that contingent claims prices and dynamic replicating portfolio strategies derived from the discrete time models converge to their corresponding continuous-time limits.",

This article formulates the American option valuation problem in economically and mathematically meaningful ways. This enables us to derive valuation formulas for American options. The properties associated with the optimal exercise boundary are examined, and a numerical technique to implement the valuation formulas is presented.",

The extended Vasicek model is shown to be very tractable analytically. The article compares option prices obtained using the extended Vasicek model with those obtained using a number of other models.",

We examine the interday variations in volume, variance, and adverse selection costs, and find that on monday the trading costs and the variance of price changes are highest, and the volume is lower than on Tuesday. These effects are stronger for firms with better public reporting and for firms with more discretionary liquidity trading.",

We document changes in bank holdings of municipal bonds in response to changes in tax rules relating to deductibility of interest expense. We also document an association between banks\u2019 marginal tax rates and their investment and financing decisions, which is consistent with the existence of tax clienteles. However, banks do not sort themselves perfectly into investment and financing clienteles because of adjustment costs. We posit specific types of transaction-cost impediments to tax planning, and document that banks apparently trade off these costs against tax-planning benefits.",

            "abstract": "In a model of takeovers under asymmetric information, we identify a separating equilibrium in which the value of the bidder firm is revealed by the mix of cash and securities used as payment for the target. The model predicts that the revealed bidder value is monotonically increasing and convex in the fraction of the total offer that consists of cash. We examine the model restrictions using data from Canada, where mixed offers are both relatively frequent and free of the confounding tax-related options characterizing mixed offers in the United States. We find that the average announcement-month bidder abnormal return in mixed offers is large and significant. However, maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in both linear and nonlinear cross-sectional regressions fail to support the model predictions.",

New funds also show significant negative after-market returns unlike other new issues.
