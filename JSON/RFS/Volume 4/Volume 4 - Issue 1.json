            "abstract": "An economy is analyzed in which agents first choose whether to acquire costly information about the return to a risky asset, and then choose demand functions that determine the allocation of assets. It is a well-known paradox that if agents are price-takers and prices are fully revealing, then an equilibrium with costly information acquisition does not exist. It is shown that if the price formation process is modeled explicitly and agents are not price-takers, then it is possible to have an equilibrium with fully revealing prices and costly information acquisition.",

            "abstract": "It is demonstrated that markets in stock index futures or, more generally, in baskets of securities, provide a preferred trading medium for uninformed liquidity traders who wish to trade portfolios, because adverse selection costs are typically lower in these markets than in markets for individual securities. Thus, an explanation is provided for the immense liquidity and popularity of markets in stock index futures. Implications are also developed for the effect of the introduction of a basket on market liquidity and the informativeness and variability of component security prices, and for the price relationship between the basket and its underlying portfolio.",

            "abstract": "In the context of an equilibrium asset-pricing model, the dynamics of the instantaneous real interest rate and the instantaneous rate of expected inflation are estimated. Unlike previous models, we allow real interest rates and inflation to be mutually dependent processes. The model is estimated as a state-space system that includes observations on various maturity Treasury bills and NBER\u2013ASA survey forecasts of inflation. Over the period 1968\u20131988, we find evidence that instantaneous real interest rates and expected inflation are significantly negatively correlated. Real interest rates also display greater volatility and weaker mean reversion than expected inflation.",

            "abstract": "An attempt is made to explain how enforceability is achieved in international debt contracts. Each bank announces the policy of denying credit to borrowers who default and chooses to adhere to it to maintain its reputation of being a tough bank to discipline its other borrowers. Loans are made by syndicates of banks in order to make the penalty for default severe enough so borrowers would choose not to default voluntarily. The model predicts that the interest rate charged on loans is smaller for the larger borrowers. Also, for any given borrower, the interest rate may fall after each successive default.",

            "abstract": "We develop a model of the acquisition market in which the acquirer has a choice between two takeover mechanisms: mergers and tender offers. A merger is modeled as a bargaining game between the acquiring and target firms; whereas a tender offer is modeled as an auction in which bidders arrive sequentially and compete for the target. At any stage of the bargaining game the acquiring firm can stop negotiating and make a tender offer. In equilibrium, there is a unique level of synergy gains below which the acquiring firm makes only a merger attempt as it expects to lose in the competition resulting from a tender offer. For synergy gains above this level, tender offers can occur. However, to get tender offers, target shareholders must give their managers golden parachutes that give higher payoffs in tender offers than in mergers.",

It is demonstrated that in certain situations debt will reduce a firm\u2019s ability to credibly offer high-quality products and, as a consequence, will reduce its value. However, for firms with assets that have high salvage values in liquidation, debt may increase their ability to credibly offer high-quality products and, therefore, increase their values.",

The main assumption is that managerial compensation is chosen optimally. This differs from most of the recent articles on this topic, which impose by fiat a suboptimal contract. Even when imperfections internal to the firm preclude optimal investment, there is a separation between incentives and financing. We conclude that corporations should move toward contracts with better incentives, and that new models should be built that recognize the limitations to optimal contracting.",
