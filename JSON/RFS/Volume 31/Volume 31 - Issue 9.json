            "abstract": "I document large and persistent errors in investors\u2019 expectations about the short-term interest rate over the business cycle. The largest errors arise in economic downturns and during Fed easings when investors overestimate future short rates and, thus, underestimate future bond returns. At a one-year horizon, errors about the path of the real rate (as opposed to inflation) account for 80% of short-rate forecast error variance, with more than half of that number attributed to the Fed easing more aggressively than the public expected. Short-rate forecast errors induce ex post predictability of excess returns on Treasury bonds that is not due to time-varying risk premium.",

            "abstract": "We develop a model in which capital moves quickly within an asset class but slowly between asset classes. While most investors specialize in a single asset class, a handful of generalists gradually reallocate capital across markets. Upon the arrival of a large supply shock, prices of risk in the directly affected asset class become disconnected from those in others. Over the long run, capital flows cause prices of risk to become more closely aligned. While prices in the directly affected market initially overreact, prices in related markets may underreact. We use the model to reassess event-study evidence on quantitative easing.",

I show that a government pursuing a nonpublic, partially informative price target in a model of strategic market-order trading and segmented dealership generates equilibrium price differentials among fundamentally identical assets by clouding dealers\u2019 inference about the targeted asset\u2019s payoff from its order flow, to an extent complexly dependent on existing price formation. I find supportive evidence using a sample of American Depositary Receipts and other cross-listings traded in the major U.S. exchanges, along with currency interventions by developed and emerging countries between 1980 and 2009.",

The manager can complete the project faster by reducing quality. To preempt this behavior, the prin cipal makes payments contingent on long-term outcomes. I analyze the dynamics of the optimal contract and its implications for the level of managerial turnover. I show that optimal contracts might be stationary and entail no termination. In general, I show that the principal reduces the manager\u2019s temptation to behave myopically by reducing the likelihood of termination and deferring compensation. The model predicts a negative relation between the rate of managerial turnover and the use of deferred compensation that is consistent with evidence of managerial compensation contracts.",

Higher capacity, ceteris paribus, increases operating leverage and default probability, but lowers ex post adjustment costs and generates larger tax shields. A key insight is that financial leverage and capacity are substitutes in the debt market equilibrium. We develop novel predictions about the effects of capital adjustment costs, operating costs, and uncertainty on optimal financial leverage and capacity that may potentially help explain ambiguous empirical results in the literature regarding the determinants of capital structure and investment.",

We find that, regardless of the reason for the turnover, CDS, loan, and bond yield spreads increase at the time of management turnover, when management risk is highest, and decline over the first three years of the new CEO\u2019s tenure. The effects increase with prior investor uncertainty about the new management. These results are consistent with the view that management risk affects firms\u2019 default risk. An understanding of management risk yields a number of implications for corporate finance.",

We compare two groups of observationally equivalent borrowers who took identical unsecured 36-month loans; for only one of the groups, a 60-month loan was also available. When a long-maturity option is available, fewer borrowers take the short-term loan, and those who do default less. Additional findings suggest borrowers self-select on private information about their future ability to repay.",

These findings suggest that borrowing can exacerbate distress, leading borrowers to use transfer programs and to prioritize payday loan payments over other liabilities like child support. In that way, payday lending produces negative externalities\u2014costs imposed on taxpayers that fund transfer programs and nonresident family members that fail to receive child support.",

We apply the model to the network of U.S. mortgage intermediaries from 2005 to 2007, using a data set containing all private-label, fixed-rate mortgages, with loan flows defining links. Default risk was closely related to network position, evolving predictably among linked nodes, and loan quality estimated from the model was related to independent quality measures, altogether pointing to the vital importance of network effects in this market.",

Using exogenous variation in the parameters of the ONRRP, we show that private repo activity is crowded out when money funds invest in the ONRRP. Additionally, we find that the ONRRP increases lenders\u2019 bargaining power, thereby raising borrower funding costs. Lastly, we show that repo borrowers reallocate to repo backed by riskier collateral and borrow more from ONRRP-ineligible asset managers, both of which could increase financial vulnerability due to instability in dealer funding.",
