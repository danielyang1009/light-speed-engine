We test the model\u2019s predictions using unique data for 5,625 equity trades during the period 1985 to 1992 that are known to be upstairs transactions and are identified as either buyer or seller initiated. We find that price movements prior to the trade date are significantly positively related to trade size, consistent with information leakage as the block is \u201cshopped\u201d upstairs. Further, the temporary price impact or liquidity effect is a concave function of order size, which may result from upstairs intermediation.",

The parameters implicit in deutsche mark (DM) options of the model and various submodels are estimated over the period 1984 to 1991 via nonlinear generalized least squares, and are tested for consistency with $/DM futures prices and the implicit volatility sample path. The stochastic volatility submodel cannot explain the \u201cvolatility smile\u201d evidence of implicit excess kurtosis, except under parameters implausible given the time series properties of implicit volatilities. Jump fears can explain the smile, and are consistent with one 8 percent DM appreciation \u201coutlier\u201d observed over the period 1984 to 1991.",

The announcement of convertible debt issues has a significant positive abnormal return of 1.05 percent. There is an abnormal return of 0.45 percent at the announcement of equity issues that is off-set by an abnormal return of 1.01 percent on the issue day. Abnormal returns are negatively related to firm size, so that large Japanese firms have abnormal returns less different from those of U.S. firms than small Japanese firms. Our evidence is consistent with the view that Japanese managers decide to issue shares based on different considerations than American managers.",

Conditions are found for when the investor holds more or less than the myopic amount of the risky asset; hedges against or speculates the risk-premium uncertainty; is long or short on the risky asset; and holds more or less of the risky asset at longer horizons. The analytical solutions derived take multiple mathematical forms and include extreme cases in which investors with long but finite horizons can attain nirvana.",

With multiple trading sessions, uninformed investors behave as rational trend followers, while more informed investors follow a contrarian strategy. As trading becomes continuous, Pareto efficiency is achieved. With trading in an appropriate derivative security, Pareto efficiency may be achieved in only a single round of trading. All derivative claims are then priced on Black and Scholes (1973) principles and, in the absence of further supply shocks, no trading will take place in subsequent trading rounds.",

We pose the question, When is control allocated only to shareholders and when is it allocated to other stakeholders, such as debtholders, or the management team? We show that shareholders (debtholders) get control when the firm\u2019s cash flow is relatively sensitive (insensitive) to managerial effort. Our theory implies that the signs of the correlations between endogenous variables when shareholders have absolute control are reversed when debtholders have veto power. In particular, debt level and firm value are negatively (positively) correlated when debtholders have veto power (shareholders have absolute control).",

In monetary economies, the price level, inflation, asset prices, and the real and nominal interest rates have to be determined simultaneously and in relation to each other. This link allows us to relate in closed form each of the dependent entities to the underlying real and monetary variables. Among other features of such economies, inflation can be partially nonmonetary and the real and nominal term structures can depend on fundamentally different risk factors. In one extreme, the process followed by the real term structure is independent of that followed by its nominal counterpart.",

We also suggest how the method can be applied to the case of any American option for which a closed-form solution exists for the corresponding European option.",

Discontinuous arbitrage suggests that a threshold error correction mechanism may characterize many aspects of the relationship between the futures and cash indexes. We use minute-by-minute data on the S&P 500 futures and cash indexes. The results indicate that nonlinear dynamics are important and related to arbitrage, and suggest that arbitrage is associated with more rapid convergence of the basis to the cost of carry than would be indicated by a linear model.",
