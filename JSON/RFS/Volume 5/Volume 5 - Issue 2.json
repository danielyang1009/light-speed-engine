            "abstract": "Two homogeneous stocks of physical capital are located in two different countries, separated by an \u201cocean.\u201d They are consumed by local residents, invested in a random production process yielding real returns, or transferred abroad. Under proportional transfer costs, trade, consumption, and capital imbalances are shown to be persistent. The heteroskedastic process for the relative price of capital in the two countries has a nonlinear, mean-reverting drift. Nevertheless, the conditional probability of the price moving from the parity value of unity is greater than the probability of it moving toward parity. The real interest-rate differential incorporates a simple risk premium.",

            "abstract": "I analyze optimal capital and ownership structures as resulting from anticipated future control contests. I focus on leverage as a device that enables the incumbent management to extract the maximum value from the rival. I show that firm value depends on both capital and ownership structures. The analysis leads to the following predictions: (i) more efficient managers use less debt, (ii) firms facing better rivals for control issue more debt, and (iii) firms with supermajority rules issue less debt. Several predictions are consistent with known empirical regularities.",

We adjust the data to take into account well-known calendar effects and long-run trends. To describe the process, we use a seminonparametric estimate of the joint density of current price change and volume conditional on past price changes and volume. Four empirical regularities are found: (i) positive correlation between conditional volatility and volume; (ii) large price movements are followed by high volume; (iii) conditioning on lagged volume substantially attenuates the \u201cleverage\u201d effect; and (iv) after conditioning on lagged volume, there is a positive risk-return relation.",

The specification is not restrictive. The test statistics do not require construction of ex post present values; instead, they are restrictions on means, variances, and covariances of price\u2013dividend ratios, dividend growth, and discount rates. I consider implications for the mean price\u2013dividend ratio, and I evaluate whether a low mean discount rate can rationalize the mean and variance of price\u2013dividend ratios. The results do not indicate any striking rejections of present-value models. However, the bulk of the variance of price\u2013dividend ratios must be accounted for by changingforecasts of discount rates and discount rates must possess some unusual characteristics.",

Replacing the price inelastic \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201cliquidity\u201d traders with strategic, utility-maximizing hedgers permits an explicit analysis of the uninformed traders\u2019 welfare, and demonstrates that several comparative statics obtained from the standard paradigm of Kyle (1984, 1985) are altered significantly upon endogenizing the trading motives of these agents. In contrast to extant models, market liquidity and price efficiency are both nonmonotonic in the number of uninformed hedgers in the market. Also, the welfare of hedgers monotonically decreases with the number of informed traders, despite greater competition between the informed.",

            "abstract": "While the theoretical relation between taxes and capital structure has been extensively analyzed, the empirical evidence on this issue has thus far been inconclusive. One of the main difficulties confronting previous empirical studies of the cross-sectional relationship between taxes and leverage was the control of intervening variables. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA), which drastically changed the tax regime, provides a unique opportunity to assess the interaction between taxes and leverage decisions in a controlled environment. We test the relationship between leverage and certain tax-related variables for a large sample of companies in the years surrounding the enactment of the TRA. The results support the tax-based theories of capital structure. The findings indicate that there exists a substitution effect between debt and nondebt tax shields, and that both corporate and personal tax rates affect leverage decisions.",
