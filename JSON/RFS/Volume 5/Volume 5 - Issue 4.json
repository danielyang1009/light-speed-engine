Unlike the one-state-variable version of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) model, this model\u2014even in its one-state-variable version\u2014allows the term premium to change sign as a function of the state and the term to maturity, and also allows for shapes of the yield curve that are observed in the U.S. data but that are disallowed in the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model",

We analyze the relationship between volatility and returns in a sample that is truncated by survivorship and show that this relationship gives rise to the appearance of predictability. We present some numerical examples to show that this effect can be strong enough to account for the strength of the evidence favoring return predictability.",

            "abstract": "I provide a general equilibrium theory of the term structure of real interest rates in a discrete-time economy. I derive the prices for one-period and two-period real bonds and a simple recursive formula for general |$k$|-period bonds, and prove that the price formula with appropriately specified parameters converges to that of the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model (1985). In addition, I consider the behavior of nominal bond prices in a partial equilibrium setting in which an exogenous price level process is correlated with the real economy. Finally, I provide an illustrative empirical investigation of the model. The results indicate a significant correlation between the price level and the growth rate of consumption, which does not support the \u201cmoney neutrality\u201d assumption underlying Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross\u2019s nominal bond prices and related empirical studies, such as Gibbons and Ramaswamy (1992), Heston (1991), and Pearson and Sun (1991).",

Specific solutions are developed for caps on floating interest rates and for European options on discount bonds, coupon bonds, coupon bond futures, and Euro-dollar futures. The solutions for the options are expressed as multivariate integrals, and we show how to reduce the calculations to univariate numerical integrations, which can be calculated very quickly. The two-factor model provides more flexibility in fitting observed term structures, and the fixed parameters of the model can be set to capture the variability of the term structure over time.",

As predicted, estimates of the \u201czero-beta\u201d rate for futures are close to zero, and premiums for systematic risk do not differ significantly across assets and futures. There is, however, evidence consistent with a specific alternative model presented by Hirshleifer (1988). Returns in foreign currency and agricultural futures vary with the net holdings of hedgers, after controlling for systematic risk. These results imply a degree of market segmentation and support hedging pressure as a determinant of futures premiums.",

Such a reputation increases the likelihood that future targets will accept low premium bids. Bidders develop reputation by using low take-it-or-leave-it offers. Consequently, tender premiums, bid revision rates, and success rates are lower for continuing bidders than for those considering only a single target. Success rates vary within a series, and reputation building is more likely with highly correlated target valuations. I provide an exploratory empirical analysis consistent with lower premiums from continuing bidders and discuss some resulting implications regarding \u201craiders,\u201d conglomerates, and resistance strategies.",

            "abstract": "We formally examine the role of litigation risk in initial public offering (IPO) pricing. The underwriter\u2019s pricing decision trades off current revenue against expected future litigation costs, both of which are increasing in the IPO price. Given a time-consistency constraint and rational expectations on the part of investors, however, the \u201cstandard\u201d litigation risk argument does not lead to equilibrium underpricing. We develop a richer model that provides sufficient conditions under which there is equilibrium underpricing. The issuer\u2019s choice of employing an underwriter versus floating the IPO on its own is examined, and various testable implications of the model are developed.",
