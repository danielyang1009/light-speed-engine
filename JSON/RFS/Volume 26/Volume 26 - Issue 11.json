            "abstract": "Feedback from stock prices to cash flows occurs because information revealed by firms' stock prices influences the actions of competitors. We explore the implications of feedback within a noisy rational expectations setting with incumbent publicly traded firms and privately held new entrants. In this setting the equilibrium relation among stock prices and both future dividends and aggregate output depends on the strategic environment in which these firms operate. In general, under reasonable conditions, the relations between prices, dividends, and economic output in our framework are consistent with empirical evidence in the macroliterature. We also generate new, potentially testable, implications.",

            "abstract": "Average return differences among firms sorted on valuation ratios, past investment, profitability, market beta, or idiosyncratic volatility are largely driven by differences in exposures of firms to the same systematic factor related to embodied technology shocks. Using a calibrated structural model, we show that these firm characteristics are correlated with the ratio of growth opportunities to firm value, which affects firms' exposures to capital-embodied productivity shocks and risk premia. We thus provide a unified explanation for several apparent anomalies in the cross-section of stock returns\u2014namely, predictability of returns by these firm characteristics and return comovement among firms with similar characteristics.",

            "abstract": "We study the relations between management contract terms and performance in private equity using new data for 837 funds from 1984\u20132010. We find no evidence that higher fees or lower managerial ownership are associated with lower net-of-fee performance. Nevertheless, compensation rises and shifts to performance-insensitive components during fundraising booms. Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund managers. Our evidence suggests that managers with higher fees deliver higher gross performance, and highlights that agency costs are an inevitable consequence of the information frictions endemic to agency relationships.",

I use a rational-expectations-based panel estimator of covenant prices, which does not require quasi-experimental variation, to circumvent the problem of endogenous covenant choices. I find that firms' surpluses exceed the spread paid on a loan. Leverage and interest-rate covenants produce the largest benefits, lending quantitative credence to several standard theories of covenants. Once covenants are chosen, the benefits from fine-tuning them are small, thus rationalizing \u201cboilerplate\u201d covenants. I conclude by discussing the extensions and limitations of my method.",

During economic downturns, the asset betas and leverage of value firms increase, contributing to a sharp rise in equity betas. Asset betas of growth firms are much less sensitive to economic conditions, and, consistent with the tradeoff theory of capital structure, growth firms are also less levered, contributing to the relative stability of their equity betas. By incorporating instruments that better capture beta dynamics, I show that the interactions of conditional betas with the market risk premium and volatility explain approximately 40% of the unconditional value premium.",

            "abstract": "We propose a decomposition for time series in components classified by levels of persistence. Employing this decomposition, we provide empirical evidence that consumption growth contains predictable components highly correlated with well-known proxies of consumption variability. These components generate a term-structure of sizable risk premia. At low frequencies we identify a component correlated with long-run productivity growth and commanding a yearly premium of approximately 2%. At high frequencies we identify a component with yearly half-life, which contributes to the equity premium for another 2%. Accounting for persistence heterogeneity, we obtain an estimate of the IES strictly above one and robust across subsamples.",

Assuming one state variable and CRRA agents, we solve for prices in closed form, calibrate the model using labor market data, and show that this simple setting captures the high, countercyclical volatility and equity premium observed in the United States. Moreover, returns in our model are conditionally predicted by dividend yields. Finally, as in the data, in our setting the disasters are larger when the capital's share of income is higher.",

            "abstract": "We analyze optimal financial contracts when the specificity of investments is endogenous. Specialization decreases the liquidation value of assets, but improves the asset's long-term productivity. While the former is known to make financing more difficult, we show that the latter can ease financing constraints and increase financing capacity by improving an entrepreneur's incentive to repay. The overall impact of specialization on the terms of financing depends on which effect is more important. Specialization decisions interact with the nature of investments, their timing, the need for outside financing, and an entrepreneur's ability to commit to a level of specialization.",
