            "abstract": "The underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) that has been widely documented appears to be a short\u2010run phenomenon. Issuing firms during 1975\u201384 substantially underperformed a sample of matching firms from the closing price on the first day of public trading to their three\u2010year anniversaries. There is substantial variation in the underperformance year\u2010to\u2010year and across industries, with companies that went public in high\u2010volume years faring the worst. The patterns are consistent with an IPO market in which (1) investors are periodically overoptimistic about the earnings potential of young growth companies, and (2) firms take advantage of these \u201cwindows of opportunity.\u201d",

The findings reveal that over the long run low\u2010grade bond fund returns are approximately equal to the returns provided by an index of high\u2010grade bonds. The relative risks of high and low\u2010grade bonds are more difficult to assess. Because of their shorter durations, low\u2010grade bonds are less sensitive to movements in interest rates than high\u2010grade bonds. On the other hand, low\u2010grade bonds are much more sensitive to changes in stock prices than high\u2010grade bonds. When adjusted for risk using a simple two\u2010factor model, the returns on low\u2010grade bond funds are not statistically different from the returns on high\u2010grade bonds.",

The evidence supports these predictions. In particular, we find that both closed\u2010end funds and small stocks tend to be held by individual investors, and that the discounts on closed\u2010end funds narrow when small stocks do well.",

Although the tests provide evidence on the conditional mean variance efficiency of the benchmark portfolio, the results show that countries' risk exposures help explain differences in performance. Evidence is also presented which indicates that these risk exposures change through time and that the world price of covariance risk is not constant.",

Estimates for a sample of NYSE issues suggest: a trade's full price impact arrives only with a protracted lag; the impact is a positive and concave function of the trade size; large trades cause the spread to widen; trades occurring in the face of wide spreads have larger price impacts; and, information asymmetries are more significant for smaller firms.",

The model ties stock returns to investment returns (marginal rates of transformation) which are inferred from investment data via a production function.

Annual real returns are shown to exhibit significant nonrandom walk behavior in the sense that low (high) returns tend to follow runs of high (low) returns in the postwar period.",

After the 1975 elimination of the tax advantage to stock\u2010dividend shares, we observe that investors convert virtually all stock\u2010dividend shares into cash\u2010dividend shares.",
