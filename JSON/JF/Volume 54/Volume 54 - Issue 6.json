The return on value is an estimate of the overall corporate cost of capital. The estimate of the real cost of capital for 1950\u201396 is 5.95 percent. The real return on cost is larger, 7.38 percent, so on average corporate investment seems to be profitable. A by\u2010product of calculating these returns is information about the history of corporate earnings, investment, and financing decisions that is perhaps more interesting than the returns.",

Cash\u2010rich firms are more likely to make diversifying acquisitions and their targets are less likely to attract other bidders. Consistent with the stock return evidence, mergers in which the bidder is cash\u2010rich are followed by abnormal declines in operating performance. Overall, the evidence supports the agency costs of free cash flow explanation for acquisitions by cash\u2010rich firms.",

We show that strategic interactions among firms can explain the lack of relative performance\u2010based incentives in which compensation decreases with rival firm performance. The need to soften product market competition generates an optimal compensation contract that places a positive weight on both own and rival performance. Firms in more competitive industries place greater weight on rival firm performance relative to own firm performance. We find empirical evidence of a positive sensitivity of compensation to rival firm performance that is increasing in the degree of competition in the industry.",

Specifically, U.S. investment managers exhibit a strong preference for locally headquartered firms, particularly small, highly levered firms that produce nontraded goods. These results suggest that asymmetric information between local and nonlocal investors may drive the preference for geographically proximate investments, and the relation between investment proximity and firm size and leverage may shed light on several well\u2010documented asset pricing anomalies.",

Finally, we show that the incremental gains from international diversification beyond home\u2010made diversification portfolios have diminished over time in a way consistent with changes in investment barriers.",

Applied to intraday quotes at 15\u2010minute intervals for Alcoa (a randomly chosen Dow stock), the results show that quote exposure costs contain stochastic components that are persistent and large relative to the deterministic intraday \u201cU\u201d components.

If information diffuses gradually across the population, prices underreact in the short run. The underreaction means that the momentum traders can profit by trend\u2010chasing. However, if they can only implement simple (i.e., univariate) strategies, their attempts at arbitrage must inevitably lead to overreaction at long horizons. In addition to providing a unified account of under\u2010 and overreactions, the model generates several other distinctive implications.",

However, explanations for security price clustering are incompatible with deposit rate clustering. A theory based on the limited recall of retail depositors is proposed. It predicts that banks tend to set rates at integers and that rates are \u201csticky\u201d at these levels. The propensity for integer rates increases with the level of wholesale interest rates and deposit market concentration. When banks set noninteger rates, rates are more likely to be just above, rather than just below, integers. The paper finds substantial empirical support for the theory's implications.",

We use simulation methods to investigate convexity induced by tax\u2010code provisions. On average, the tax function is convex (although in approximately 25 percent of cases it is concave). Carrybacks and carryforwards increase the range of income with incentives to hedge; other tax\u2010code provisions have minor impacts. Among firms facing convex tax functions, average tax savings from a five percent reduction in the volatility of taxable income are about 5.4 percent of expected tax liabilities; in extreme cases, these savings exceed 40 percent.",

Among instruments that are callable without penalty, longer instruments command a higher interest rate because the borrower possesses the option of repaying relatively more slowly. However, the rate on longer self\u2010amortizing loans cannot be substantially larger than for shorter ones because the payments decrease with contract length. Bounds on the trade\u2010off between points and rate for callable debt are characterized using the trade\u2010off for noncallable debt and the property that the value of the prepayment option increases with the loan's interest rate.",

In contrast to stock returns, interest rate volatility exhibits faster mean\u2010reverting behavior and innovations in interest rate volatility are negligibly correlated with innovations in interest rates. The less persistent behavior of interest rate volatility reflects the fact that interest rate dynamics are impacted by transient economic shocks such as central bank announcements and other macroeconomic news.",
