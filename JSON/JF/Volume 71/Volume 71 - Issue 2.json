Survey responses suggest that job seekers accurately perceive firms\u2019 financial condition, as measured by companies\u2019 credit default swap prices and accounting data. Analyzing responses to job postings by major financial firms during the Great Recession, we find that an increase in an employer's distress results in fewer and lower quality applicants. These effects are particularly evident when the social safety net provides workers with weak protection against unemployment and for positions requiring a college education.",

Realistic, high\u2010dimensional macroeconomic learning problems, which entail parameter, model, and state learning, generate substantially different subjective beliefs about consumption dynamics compared to the standard, full\u2010information rational expectations benchmark. Beliefs about long\u2010run dynamics are volatile, with counter\u2010cyclical conditional volatility, and drift over time. Embedding these beliefs in a standard asset pricing model significantly improves the model's ability to match the stylized facts, as well as the sample path of the market price\u2010dividend ratio.",

Using segment\u2010level capital allocation in multisegment firms (\u201cconglomerates\u201d) as a laboratory, we show that capital expenditure is increasing in the expected skewness of segment returns. Conglomerates invest more in high\u2010skewness segments than matched stand\u2010alone firms, and trade at a discount, which indicates overinvestment that is detrimental to shareholder wealth. Using geographical variation in gambling norms, we find that the skewness\u2010investment relation is particularly pronounced when CEOs are likely to find long shots attractive. Our findings suggest that CEOs allocate capital with a long\u2010shot bias.",

I introduce a simple approach that decomposes the price impact of trades into inventory risk and asymmetric information components. While both components are large for option trades, the inventory risk component is larger. Using the full panel of daily option returns, I find that option order imbalances attributable to inventory risk have five times larger impact on option prices than previously thought. Finally, I find that past order imbalances have greater predictive power than any other commonly used predictor of option returns.",

Uninformed investors access an asset pool that has been cream\u2010skimmed by informed investors. When the quality composition of assets for sale is fixed, there is too much information acquisition and the financial industry extracts excessive rents. In the presence of moral hazard in origination, the social value of information varies inversely with information acquisition. Low quality origination is associated with large rents in the financial sector. Equilibrium acquisition of information is generically inefficient.",

In our setting, directors affect their firms' governance, and governance in turn affects firms' demand for new directors. Whether the labor market rewards a shareholder\u2010friendly or management\u2010friendly reputation is determined in equilibrium and depends on aggregate governance. We show that directors' desire to be invited to other boards creates strategic complementarity of corporate governance across firms. Directors' reputational concerns amplify the governance system: strong systems become stronger and weak systems become weaker. We derive implications for multiple directorships, board size, transparency, and board independence.",

In \u201cnormal times,\u201d the market is fully liquid and gains from trade are realized immediately. However, the equilibrium also involves periods during which liquidity \u201cdries up,\u201d which leads to endogenous liquidation costs. Traders correctly anticipate such costs, which reduces their willingness to pay. This foresight leads to a novel feedback effect between prices and market liquidity, which are jointly determined in equilibrium. The model also predicts that contagious sell\u2010offs can occur after sufficiently bad news.",

Combining direct and indirect incentives,\u00a0manager wealth increases by at least $0.39 for a $1 increase in investor wealth.

In response to an exogenous shock to credit risk in the German economy, capital charges for loans under model\u2010based regulation increased by 0.5\u00a0percentage points. As a consequence, banks reduced the amount of these loans by 2.1 to 3.9\u00a0percentage points more than for loans under the traditional approach with fixed capital charges. We find an even stronger effect when we examine aggregate firm borrowing, suggesting that microprudential capital regulation can have sizeable real effects.",
