Portfolio returns are 26% lower out\u2010of\u2010sample and 58% lower post\u2010publication. The out\u2010of\u2010sample decline is an upper bound estimate of data mining effects. We estimate a 32% (58%\u201326%) lower return from publication\u2010informed trading. Post\u2010publication declines are greater for predictors with higher in\u2010sample returns, and returns are higher for portfolios concentrated in stocks with high idiosyncratic risk and low liquidity. Predictor portfolios exhibit post\u2010publication increases in correlations with other published\u2010predictor portfolios. Our findings suggest that investors learn about mispricing from academic publications.",

Rational investors with subjective beliefs about price behavior optimally learn from past price observations. This imparts momentum and mean reversion into stock prices. The model quantitatively accounts for the volatility of returns, the volatility and persistence of the price\u2010dividend ratio, and the predictability of long\u2010horizon returns. It passes a formal statistical test for the overall fit of a set of moments provided one excludes the equity premium.",

We propose a risk\u2010based explanation for this phenomenon, whereby investors use announcements to revise their expectations for nonannouncing firms, but can only do so imperfectly. Consequently, the covariance between firm\u2010specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns. Nonannouncers' response to announcements is consistent with our model, both over time and across firms. Finally, exposure to announcement risk is priced.",

A number of explanations for the delay rely on the size of the dividends that bondholders forgo so long as they do not convert. We investigate an important change in convertible security design, namely, dividend protection of convertible bond issues. Dividend protection means that the conversion value of the convertible bond is unaffected by dividend payments and thus dividend\u2010related rationales for call delay become moot. We document that call delay is near zero for dividend\u2010protected convertible bonds.",

This effect is more pronounced among stocks with higher short\u2010selling constraints. These findings support the view that unusually low trading volume signals negative information, since, under short\u2010selling constraints, informed agents with bad news stay by the sidelines. Changes in visibility or risk\u2010based explanations are insufficient to explain the results. This evidence provides insights into why unusually low trading volume predicts price declines.",

Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effect\u2014the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses\u2014applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse\u2010disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors' cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse\u2010disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse\u2010disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a unified explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation.",

We argue that temperature\u2010based financial markets generate additional scrutiny of the temperature data measured by the National Weather Service, which motivates the agency to minimize measurement errors. Our results have broader implications: the visibility and scrutiny generated by financial markets can potentially improve the efficiency of government agencies.",

Nevertheless, he realizes a large fraction of his profits from trading on long\u2010term price changes. The fast speculator's behavior matches evidence about high\u2010frequency traders.

Family performance has two effects on a member fund's estimated skill and inflows: a positive common\u2010skill effect, and a negative correlated\u2010noise effect. The overall spillover can be either positive or negative, depending on the weight of common skill and correlation of noise in returns. Its absolute value increases with family size, and declines over time. The sensitivity of flows to a fund's own performance is affected accordingly. Empirical estimates of fund flow sensitivities show patterns consistent with rational cross\u2010fund learning within families.",

Empirically, we find that anomalies are more pronounced for firms with high idiosyncratic cash flow volatility. More generally, our results imply that any economic variable correlated with the history of idiosyncratic shocks can help to explain expected stock returns.",

Using data on individual corporate debt issues between 1987 and 2009, we find that gap\u2010filling behavior is more prominent in the very long end of the maturity spectrum where the required risk capital makes arbitrage costly. In addition, changes in the supply of long\u2010term government bonds affect not just the choice of maturity but also the overall level of corporate borrowing.",
