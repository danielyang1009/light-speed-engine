The factors are the short\u2010term interest rate and the volatility of the short\u2010term interest rate. We derive closed\u2010form expressions for discount bonds and study the properties of the term structure implied by the model. The dependence of yields on volatility allows the model to capture many observed properties of the term structure. We also derive closed\u2010form expressions for discount bond options. We use Hansen's generalized method of moments framework to test the cross\u2010sectional restrictions imposed by the model. The tests support the two\u2010factor model.",

Examples include losing the use of short sale proceeds and lending funds at below market rates in reverse repurchase agreements. This paper analyzes the investment problem of a risk averse arbitrageur who faces holding costs. The model allows prices to deviate from \u201cfundamental\u201d values without allowing for riskless arbitrage opportunities. After characterizing an arbitrageur's optimal strategy, the model is examined in the context of the Treasury market. The analysis reveals that holding costs are an important friction in this market and that they can significantly affect arbitrageur behavior.",

When a firm in financial distress needs to sell assets, its industry peers are likely to be experiencing problems themselves, leading to asset sales at prices below value in best use. Such illiquidity makes assets cheap in bad times, and so ex ante is a significant private cost of leverage. We use this focus on asset buyers to explain variation in debt capacity across industries and over the business cycle, as well as the rise in U.S. corporate leverage in the 1980s.",

The firm's portfolio choice of borrowing source and the choice of priority for its debt claims attempt to optimally circumscribe the powers of banks.",

A key result is that only managers of targets with \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d asset specificity should consider the takeover threat credible.

I test this hypothesis by estimating the Euler equation of an optimizing model of investment. Including the effect of a debt constraint greatly improves the Euler equation's performance in comparison to the standard specification. When the sample is split on the basis of two measures of financial distress, the standard Euler equation fits well for the a priori unconstrained groups, but is rejected for the others.",

However, uninformed investors still earn positive expected profits by establishing a futures position and then trading in the spot market to manipulate the spot price used to compute the cash settlement at delivery. We also show that as the number of manipulators grows, profits from manipulation fall to zero. However, even in the limit, manipulation still has a nontrivial impact on market liquidity. More broadly, we interpret manipulation as a form of endogenous \u201cnoise trading\u201d which can arise in multiperiod security markets.",

The model shows that in the absence of a swap market, interest rate uncertainty can lead firms to substitute long\u2010term for short\u2010term financing. However, when swaps exist, there is a tendency for firms that expect their credit quality to improve to borrow short\u2010term and use swaps to hedge interest rate risk. The model suggests that, while the demand for fixed for floating swaps is enhanced, the demand for floating for fixed swaps is reduced by the presence of asymmetric information.",

While the text of \u201cThe Theory of Capital Structure\u201d (p. 334) correctly states that Long and Malitz find a negative relationship between leverage and profitability, in Tables IV, V, and VII, a positive, but insignificant, relationship is incorrectly reported. The authors apologize for this error and thank Professor Michael Long of Rutgers University for bringing it to their attention.",

Thus, in Table III, the column showing 10 cumulative publications indicates that 1 person had at least 10 publications through their third year after graduation, 2 had at least 10 publications showing on their vitae at\nt\n=\n4\n(4 years after graduation), and 9 had at least",
