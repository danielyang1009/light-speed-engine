Execution cost differences provide a measure of the relative performance of specialist firms. We find a substantial difference in effective spreads and order processing costs across specialist firms, controlling for stock characteristics. While economically significant, the differences in execution costs between specialist firms are much smaller than the cross\u2010market differences reported by Huang and Stoll (1996). Within a specialist firm, there is a positive relation between order processing costs and trading activity that is consistent with the hypothesis that active stocks subsidize inactive stocks.",

Voucher prices and following secondary market prices are shown to depend upon the resulting ownership structures. The more concentrated ownership is, the higher prices are. High absolute ownership by a single domestic investor is associated with even higher voucher prices. I find some evidence that initially prices are relatively lower when a bank\u2010sponsored investment fund has a relatively large stake in a firm. This suggests conflicts of interest.",

We provide additional evidence on the determinants of privatization initial returns. Our findings indicate that initial returns are significantly higher in relatively primitive capital markets and for privatized companies in regulated industries.",

The standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methodology is replaced by a probit model.

In\u2010sample tests indicate that probit\u2010based betting strategies generate statistically significant profits. Whereas the profitability of a number of these betting strategies is confirmed by out\u2010of\u2010sample testing, there is some inconsistency among the remaining out\u2010of\u2010sample predictions.

The time series analysis of spreads between zero\u2010coupon swap and treasury yields reveals that both credit and liquidity factors were important sources of variation in swap spreads over the past decade.",

Firms with extensive foreign exchange\u2010rate exposure and economies of scale in hedging activities are also more likely to use currency derivatives.

However, top executives' trading is reliably associated with the stock returns of secondary issuers, who sell mostly secondary shares previously held by existing shareholders.
