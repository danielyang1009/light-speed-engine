            "abstract": "This paper reports a new test of two competing theories of the relation between tax\u2010exempt and taxable interest rates. The Miller hypothesis predicts that the tax\u2010exempt rate is 52 percent of the taxable rate, while the institutional demand hypothesis predicts a volatile relationship. The tests in this paper employ a random intercept model to control for the risk of average interest rates. The results favor the Miller hypothesis. Marginal tax rates are found to be close to Miller's predicted 48 percent. The relationship is not influenced by relative demand or supply and the marginal tax rate appears stable over time.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the effects of loan commitments on bank lending behavior in both deposit\u2010funding and liability management environments. Assuming that the bank lends exclusively under commitments and that the number of commitments exercised is uncertain, the bank must choose its supply of commitments. Given this choice, the bank becomes a passive lender to commitment holders. Our focus on forward credit markets sheds new light on the private bankers' assertion that they do not directly determine their level of lending, but merely \u201caccommodate\u201d the credit needs of their customers. Similarly, the central banker's claimed inability to control monetary aggregates in the short\u2010run becomes understandable in a new context. It is shown that the advent of liability management will reduce the volume of loan commitments and the expected size of the bank and of the banking system. It is also shown that increased uncertainty regarding borrower takedown behavior diminishes the volume of commitments, expected bank and banking system size.",

The second aim is to identify those potential borrowers most likely to be rationed out of the market by the imposition of rate ceilings. Rate ceilings constrain the rates paid by successful loan applicants to be no greater than the applicable ceiling level. These constraints are dealt with by treating the interest rate paid as a variable truncated at the ceiling level. Assuming the dependent variable is truncated normal, consistent estimates are obtained by employing the maximum likelihood method of Hausman and Wise.",

The optimal contract under which the offer price decision is delegated to the better\u2010informed banker in order to deal with the adverse selection and moral hazard problems resulting from the informational asymmetry and the observability problem is characterized. The model demonstrates a positive demand for investment banking advising and distribution services and provides an explanation of the underpricing of new issues.",

Previous papers have focussed on the \u201csecurities effect,\u201d tending to essentially ignore the equally important \u201cendowment effect\u201d that arises when market structure changes are implemented. Two forms of endowment neutrality and market structure changes which either preserve, expand, or shift allocational feasibility differentiate the main theorems, which are based on arbitrary preferences and beliefs and substantially extend and modify extant results; in particular, earlier statements identified with value conservation are sharply moderated. Very roughly, the paper yields the following implications for some of the more common changes in the market: nonsynergistic corporate spinoffs and the opening of option markets have, on balance, strongly positive welfare effects; nonsynergistic mergers tend to have strong negative welfare effects, while the welfare effects of alternative risky debt structures tend to be ambiguous. All of the preceding, however, may under plausible conditions be redistributive.",

The conditions involve consumer endowments, the allocative efficiency of the financial market, and value maximizing behavior by firms. Cases exist where consumers will prefer disclosure of public information in a production and exchange economy, although they would be indifferent to such disclosure in an otherwise similar pure exchange economy. The difference in results is due purely to the fact that in production and exchange economies, information may be used to reallocate resources across time and firms, thus highlighting the fundamental difference between the role of information in pure exchange and in production and exchange economies.",

The competitive premium is shown to be proportional to the claim frequency and the price index for claim settlements at the time the policy is issued. The factor of proportionality varies directly with the claim settlement rate and the length of coverage, and inversely with the risk\u2010adjusted real interest rate on the dollar\u2010valued claim rate.",
