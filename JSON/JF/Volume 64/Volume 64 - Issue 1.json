            "abstract": "We study the portfolio choice of hedge fund managers who are compensated by high\u2010water mark contracts. We find that even risk\u2010neutral managers do not place unbounded weights on risky assets, despite option\u2010like contracts. Instead, they place a constant fraction of funds in a mean\u2010variance efficient portfolio and the rest in the riskless asset, acting as would constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investors. This result is a direct consequence of the in(de)finite horizon of the contract. We show that the risk\u2010seeking incentives of option\u2010like contracts rely on combining finite horizons and convex compensation schemes rather than on convexity alone.",

While short\u2010selling activity increases both for NYSE\u2010 and Nasdaq\u2010listed Pilot stocks, returns and volatility at the daily level are unaffected. NYSE\u2010listed Pilot stocks experience more symmetric trading patterns and a slight increase in spreads and intraday volatility after the suspension while there is a smaller effect on market quality for Nasdaq\u2010listed Pilot stocks. The results suggest that the effect of the price tests on market quality can largely be attributed to distortions in order flow created by the price tests themselves.",

Firm business lines remain remarkably stable while management turnover is substantial. Management turnover is positively related to alienable asset formation. We obtain similar results using all 2004 IPOs, suggesting that our main results are not specific to VC\u2010backed firms or the time period. The results suggest that, at the margin, investors in start\u2010ups should place more weight on the business (\u201cthe horse\u201d) than on the management team (\u201cthe jockey\u201d). The results also inform theories of the firm.",

Consistent with the model, I find that after repurchases, employees and managers receive fewer stock option and equity grants, and that the market reacts favorably to repurchase announcements when employees have many unvested stock options. Managers are more likely to initiate share repurchases when employees hold a large stake in the firm. Moreover, since employees are forced to bear more risk in firms that repurchase shares, they exercise their stock options earlier and receive higher compensation.",

U.S. firms finance R&D from volatile sources: cash flow and stock issues. We estimate dynamic R&D models for high\u2010tech firms and find significant effects of cash flow and external equity for young, but not mature, firms. The financial coefficients for young firms are large enough that finance supply shifts can explain most of the dramatic 1990s R&D boom, which implies a significant connection between finance, innovation, and growth.",

The main parallels between the groups are a significantly positive market reaction for the target firm around the initial Schedule 13D filing date, significantly positive returns over the subsequent year, and the activist's high success rate in achieving its original objective. Further, both activists frequently gain board representation through real or threatened proxy solicitations. Two major differences are that hedge funds target more profitable firms than other activists, and hedge funds address cash flow agency costs whereas other private investors change the target's investment strategies.",

We find a significant decrease in CEO compensation for firms that were more affected by these requirements, compared with firms that were less affected, taking into account unobservable firm effects, time\u2010varying industry effects, size, and performance. The decrease in compensation is particularly pronounced in the subset of affected firms with no outside blockholder on the board and in affected firms with low concentration of institutional investors. Our results suggest that the new board requirements affected CEO compensation decisions.",

I argue that these differences are due to private equity being more costly than public equity. I further examine the private firms subsample to show that private equity is more costly than its public counterpart due to information asymmetry and the desire to maintain control.",

CEOs with more control pay their workers more, but financial incentives through cash flow rights ownership mitigate such behavior. Entrenched CEOs pay more to employees closer to them in the corporate hierarchy, geographically closer to the headquarters, and associated with conflict\u2010inclined unions. The evidence is consistent with entrenched CEOs paying more to enjoy private benefits such as lower effort wage bargaining and improved social relations with employees. Our results show that managerial ownership and corporate governance can play an important role for employee compensation.",

We find that strong union laws protect not only workers but also underperforming managers. Weak investor protection combined with strong union laws are conducive to worker\u2013management alliances, wherein poorly performing firms sell assets to prevent large\u2010scale layoffs, garnering worker support to retain management. Asset sales in weak investor protection countries lead to further deteriorating performance, whereas in strong investor protection countries they improve performance and lead to more layoffs. Strong union laws are less effective in preventing layoffs when financial leverage is high.",

Consistent with asymmetric information, trading is more one\u2010sided before merger news. Consistent with belief heterogeneity, trading is more two\u2010sided before earnings and macro announcements with greater dispersion in analyst forecasts, and after news with larger announcement surprises.

Theory has proposed that when private benefits are high, controlling shareholders are less likely to choose to cross\u2010list in the United States because of constraints on the consumption of private benefits resulting from such listings. Using several proxies for private benefits related to the control and cash flow ownership rights of controlling shareholders, we find support for this hypothesis with a sample of more than 4,000 firms from 31 countries.",
