            "abstract": "We provide new evidence on the success of long\u2010run risks in asset pricing by focusing on the risks borne by stockholders. Exploiting microlevel household consumption data, we show that long\u2010run stockholder consumption risk better captures cross\u2010sectional variation in average asset returns than aggregate or nonstockholder consumption risk, and implies more plausible risk aversion estimates. We find that risk aversion around 10 can match observed risk premia for the wealthiest stockholders across sets of test assets that include the 25 Fama and French portfolios, the market portfolio, bond portfolios, and the entire cross\u2010section of stocks.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes how blockholders can exert governance even if they cannot intervene in a firm's operations. Blockholders have strong incentives to monitor the firm's fundamental value because they can sell their stakes upon negative information. By trading on private information (following the \u201cWall Street Rule\u201d), they cause prices to reflect fundamental value rather than current earnings. This in turn encourages managers to invest for long\u2010run growth rather than short\u2010term profits. Contrary to the view that the U.S.'s liquid markets and transient shareholders exacerbate myopia, I show that they can encourage investment by impounding its effects into prices.",

This finding is not driven by aggregate time\u2010series shocks, income effects, rational learning about investing skill, investor fixed effects, or time\u2010varying investor\u2010level heterogeneity that is correlated with portfolio allocations to stock, bond, and cash asset classes.

Consistent with the model, the results show that when informed traders do not observe prices, uninformed traders generate long\u2010term price reversals by engaging in momentum trade. However, when informed traders also observe prices, uninformed traders generate reversals by engaging in contrarian trading. The results suggest that a dominated information set is sufficient to account for the contrarian behavior observed among individual investors, and that uninformed traders may be responsible for long\u2010term price reversals but play little role in driving short\u2010term momentum.",

The theory predicts that when investors place higher valuations on low\u2010price firms, managers respond by supplying shares at lower price levels, and vice versa. We confirm these predictions in time\u2010series and firm\u2010level data using several measures of time\u2010varying catering incentives. More generally, the results provide unusually clean evidence that catering influences corporate decisions, because the process of targeting nominal share prices is not well explained by alternative theories.",

We then establish the following stylized facts regarding stock return comovements. First, there is no evidence for an upward trend in return correlations, except for the European stock markets. Second, the increasing importance of industry factors relative to country factors was a short\u2010lived phenomenon. Third, large growth stocks are more correlated across countries than are small value stocks, and the difference has increased over time.",

Stock price patterns suggest executives manipulate option exercises. They use private information to increase the profitability of all three strategies, and likely backdated some exercise dates in the pre\u2010Sarbanes\u2010Oxley period to enhance the profitability of the latter two strategies, where the executive's company is the only counterparty. Backdating is associated with reporting of internal control weaknesses.",

Based on macroeconomic data, we identify a Bayesian investor's belief evolution when facing a possible structural break in the economy. We show that such belief evolution plays a significant role in explaining both the stock market boom and crash during 1998 to 2001. We conclude that a rational investor's uncertainty about the future of the U.S. economy provides an alternative explanation for the late 1990s stock market \u201cbubble.\u201d",

When agents have KUJ preferences, in the presence of undiversifiable nonfinancial wealth, both world and domestic risk (the idiosyncratic component of domestic wealth) are priced, and the equilibrium price of risk of the domestic factor is negative. We use labor income as a proxy for domestic wealth and find empirical support for these predictions. In terms of explaining the cross\u2010section of stock returns and the size of the pricing errors, the model performs better than alternative international asset pricing models.",

For such an investor, the price level is more relevant than the short\u2010horizon expected return, and betas of cash flow fundamentals are more important than high\u2010frequency stock return betas. Our cross\u2010sectional tests suggest that there exist specifications in which differences in relative price levels of individual stocks can be largely explained by their fundamental betas.",

We show that exponential growth bias can explain two stylized facts in household finance: the tendency to underestimate an interest rate given other loan terms, and the tendency to underestimate a future value given other investment terms. Bias matters empirically: More\u2010biased households borrow more, save less, favor shorter maturities, and use and benefit more from financial advice, conditional on a rich set of household characteristics. There is little evidence that our measure of exponential growth bias merely proxies for broader financial sophistication.",
