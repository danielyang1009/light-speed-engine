            "abstract": "Liquidity suppliers lean against the wind. We analyze whether high\u2010frequency traders (HFTs) lean against large institutional orders that execute through a series of child orders. The alternative is HFTs trading with the wind, that is, in the same direction. We find that HFTs initially lean against these orders but eventually change direction and take positions in the same direction for the most informed institutional orders. Our empirical findings are consistent with investors trading strategically on their information. When deciding trade intensity, they seem to trade off higher speculative profits against higher risk of being detected and preyed on by\u00a0HFTs.",

            "abstract": "We develop a continuous\u2010time model of liquidity provision in which hedgers can trade multiple risky assets with arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs have constant relative risk\u2010aversion (CRRA) utility, while hedgers' asset demand is independent of wealth. An increase in hedgers' risk aversion can make arbitrageurs endogenously more risk\u2010averse. Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth or a reduction in their CRRA coefficient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios declining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs offer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiquidity, which declines in wealth, captures that\u00a0factor.",

We estimate exercise rates as functions of option, stock, and employee characteristics using all employee exercises at 88 public firms, 27 of them in the S&P 500. Increasing vesting frequency from annual to monthly reduces option value by 11% to 16%. Men exercise faster, reducing value by 2% to 4%, while top employees exercise slower, increasing value by 2% to 7%. Finally, we develop an analytic valuation approximation that is more accurate than methods used in practice.",

Using a novel convertible bond data set, I find that consumers often purchase dominated bonds\u2014cheap and expensive otherwise\u2010identical bonds coexist in the market. Brokers are incentivized to sell the dominated bonds, typically earning two times greater fees for selling them. I develop and estimate a broker\u2010intermediated search model that rationalizes this behavior. The estimates indicate that costly search is a key friction in financial markets, but the effects of search costs are compounded when brokers are incentivized to direct the search of consumers toward high\u2010fee inferior products.",

Because uninformed reputation\u2010motivated venture capitalists want to appear informed, they are biased against backing firms\u2014by not backing firms, they avoid taking low\u2010value firms to market, which would ultimately reveal their lack of information. In equilibrium, reputation\u2010motivated venture capitalists back relatively few bad firms, creating a certification effect that mitigates information frictions. However, they also back relatively few good firms, and thus, reputation motivation decreases welfare when good firms are abundant or\u00a0profitable.",

To explain these findings, I present a general\u00a0equilibrium model in which central countries' consumption growth is more exposed\u00a0to global consumption growth shocks. This causes the currencies\u00a0of central countries to appreciate in bad times, resulting in\u00a0lower interest rates and currency risk premia.

Compared with levered (stock) returns, unlevered market beta plays a more important role in explaining\u00a0the cross\u2010section of unlevered equity returns, even after controlling for size\u00a0and BTM. The size effect is weakened, while the value premium and the\u00a0volatility puzzle virtually disappear for unlevered returns. We show that\u00a0leverage induces heteroskedasticity in returns. Unlevering returns removes\u00a0this pattern, which is otherwise difficult to address by controlling for\u00a0leverage in\u00a0regressions.",

We find that households protected by limited liability suffer from a household\u2010debt\u2010overhang problem that leads them to require high wages to work. Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies. This vacancy posting effect implies that high household debt leads to high unemployment. Even though households borrow from banks via bilaterally optimal contracts, the equilibrium level of household debt is inefficiently high due to a household\u2010debt externality. We analyze the role that a financial regulator can play in mitigating this\u00a0externality.",

Yet, the model shows that unique stock price equilibria exist for a broader range of CC contractual terms than those required by SW.
