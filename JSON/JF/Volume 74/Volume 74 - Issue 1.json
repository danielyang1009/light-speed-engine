            "abstract": "This paper investigates the consequences of liquidation and reorganization on the allocation and subsequent utilization of assets in bankruptcy. Using the random assignment of judges to bankruptcy cases as a natural experiment that forces some firms into liquidation, we find that the long\u2010run utilization of assets of liquidated firms is lower relative to assets of reorganized firms. These effects are concentrated in thin markets with few potential users and in areas with low access to finance. These findings suggest that when search frictions are large, liquidation can lead to inefficient allocation of assets in bankruptcy.",

Results support an international risk\u2010taking channel and spillovers of core countries\u2019 monetary policies to emerging markets, both in the foreign monetary softening part (with higher credit and liquidity risk\u2010taking by foreign banks) and in the tightening part (with negative local firm\u2010level real effects).",

Regulatory data show that this network has a core\u2010periphery structure with 10 to 30 hubs and over 2,000 peripheral broker\u2010dealers in which bonds flow from periphery to core and partially back. Central dealers charge investors up to double the round\u2010trip markups compared to peripheral dealers. In turn, central dealers provide immediacy by matching buyers with sellers more directly and prearranging fewer trades, especially during stress times. Investors thus face a trade\u2010off between execution cost and speed, consistent with network models of decentralized trade.",

To maximize shareholder value, dealer quotations therefore adjust for FVAs. Our case studies include interest\u2010rate swap FVAs and violations of covered interest parity. Contrary to current valuation practice, FVAs are not themselves components of the market values of the positions being financed. Current dealer practice does, however, align incentives between trading desks and shareholders. We also establish a pecking order for preferred asset financing strategies and provide a new interpretation of the standard debit value adjustment.",

Intradaily jumps in futures prices are typically small; self\u2010exciting but short\u2010lived volatility spikes capture intradaily and daily returns better. Multifactor models of the evolution of diffusive variance and jump intensities improve fits substantially, including out\u2010of\u2010sample over 2009 to 2016. The models capture reasonably well the conditional distributions of daily returns and realized variance outliers, but underpredict realized variance inliers. I also examine option pricing implications.",

Basis\u2010momentum strongly outperforms benchmark characteristics in predicting commodity spot and term premiums in both the time series and the cross section. Exposure to basis\u2010momentum is priced among commodity\u2010sorted portfolios and individual commodities. We argue that basis\u2010momentum captures imbalances in the supply and demand of futures contracts that materialize when the market\u2010clearing ability of speculators and intermediaries is impaired, and that it represents compensation for priced risk. Our findings are inconsistent with alternative explanations based on storage, inventory, and hedging pressure.",

In the one\u2010factor production\u2010based asset pricing model, when the frictions to capital adjustment are shaped to respect the evidence on investment, the model\u2010generated cross\u2010sectional dispersion of returns is only a small fraction of that documented in the data.

Recovered conditional moments predict future realizations and give insight into the cyclicality of equity premia, variance risk premia, and the highest attainable Sharpe ratios under the minimum variance probability. The pricing kernel projections are often U\u2010shaped and give rise to optimal conditional portfolio strategies with plausible market timing properties, moderate countercyclical exposures to higher realized moments, and favorable out\u2010of\u2010sample Sharpe ratios.",

Markets comprising solely such \u201ccursed\u201d traders generate more trade than those comprising solely rationals. Because rationals arbitrage away distortions caused by cursed traders, mixed markets can generate even more trade. Per\u2010trader volume in cursed markets increases with market size; volume may instead disappear when traders infer others' information from prices, even when they dismiss it as noisier than their own. Making private information public raises rational and \u201cdismissive\u201d volume, but reduces cursed volume given moderate noninformational trading motives.",

The LASSO increases both out\u2010of\u2010sample fit and forecast\u2010implied Sharpe ratios.

However, exploiting price discrepancies has risk when returns have the same expected value but are uncorrelated, in which case the law of one price is violated. Discrepancies shrink in consecutive markets, but persist even with experienced traders. In markets where overall trader acuity is high, assets trade closer to parity.",
