            "abstract": "The no\u2010arbitrage martingale analysis is used to study the effect on asset prices of changes in the rate of information flow. The analysis is first used to develop some simple tools for asset pricing in a continuous\u2010time setting. These tools are then applied to determine the effect of information on prices and price volatility, to extend Samuelson's theorem on prices fluctuating randomly, and to study the impact on prices of the resolution of uncertainty. The conditions under which uncertainty resolution is irrelevant for asset pricing are shown to be similar to those which support the MM irrelevance theorems.",

The theory provides the optimal dynamic recapitalization policy as a function of firm\u2010specific characteristics. We find that even small recapitalization costs lead to wide swings in a firm's debt ratio over time. Rather than static leverage measures, we use the observed debt ratio range of a firm as an empirical measure of capital structure relevance. The results of empirical tests relating firms' debt ratio ranges to firm\u2010specific features strongly support the theoretical model of relevant capital structure choice in a dynamic setting.",

Cash has the advantage of serving, in equilibrium, to \u201cpreempt\u201d competition by signaling a high valuation for the target. Implications concerning the medium of exchange of an offer, the probability of acceptance, the probability of competing bids, expected profits, and the costs of bidders are derived.",

We use predictions from auction theory to test whether acquirers of failed banks overpay (the \u201cwinner's curse\u201d) when bidding in FDIC sealed\u2010bid purchase and assumption (P&A) transactions (auctions). The empirical results indicate that winning bids tend to increase as the number of competitors increases, as predicted by theory. We also find that bid levels of all bidders increase with increased competition, which is consistent with bidders' failing to adjust for the winner's curse in a common value auction setting. However, additional tests using winning bids only are consistent with both a common value and a private values model, so this result should be interpreted with caution.",

Nonsynchronous trading explains part of the large absolute futures\u2010cash basis observed during the crash. The remainder may be due to disintegration of the two markets. Even after adjustment for nonsynchronous trading, the index displays more autocorrelation than does the futures and the futures leads the index.",

We explore the implications of the quality option on the futures price. We develop a method for pricing the quality option for the general case of n deliverable assets and provide numerical illustrations of its significance. Even when the asset prices are very highly correlated, this option can have nontrivial value, especially when there is a large number of deliverable assets. We analyze the impact of the timing option and its interaction with the quality option. A procedure is developed for valuing the timing option in the presence of the quality option, and some numerical estimates are obtained.",

The findings differ from those of other studies due to the use of value\u2010weighted, rather than equally weighted, portfolios. Inferences are sensitive to the weighting procedure because of the small\u2010firm return patterns in January. In particular, even in those Januaries for which the market return is negative, small\u2010firm returns are positive, and they are more positive the higher is beta. This is consistent with the portfolio rebalancing explanation of the turn\u2010of\u2010the\u2010year effect.",

This is consistent with the hypothesis that the seven exchange rates possess one long\u2010run relationship and that the disequilibrium error around that relationship partly accounts for subsequent movements in the exchange rates.",

The testable restrictions imposed by the model are consistent with both cross\u2010country and cross\u2010maturity forward contracts except at the short end of the maturity spectrum for cross\u2010country forward exchange rates.
