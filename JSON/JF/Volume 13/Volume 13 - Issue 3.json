Their conclusions, reached on the basis of data for major metropolitan areas, were essentially as follows:\n1.\nLending institutions usually operate in a set pattern with respect to FHA and VA lending. That is, life insurance companies and commercial banks are stronger supporters of federal housing finance programs than savings and loan associations.\n2.\nTherefore, the impact of FHA and VA programs on specific markets is predictable. That is, in those markets where savings and loan associations are the predominant lenders the proportion of insured lending will be lower than in areas where life insurance companies and/or commercial banks predominate.\nThe object of this note is to test the applicability of these conclusions to the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, a non\u2010metropolitan mortgage market.",

            "abstract": "Sometime ago A critical issue of contemporary monetary theory and policy was discussed by Alvin Hansen in the Journal of Political Economy.1\n1 A. H. Hansen, \u201cThe Pigouvian Effect,\u201d Journal of Political Economy, LIX (December, 1951), 535\u201336.\n\nIn his article Hansen raised the question of whether the Pigou effect itself could do more than stop a deflation involving a decline in output, employment, income, and the price level. In answering this question in the negative, Hansen concluded:\nAs soon as the increased real value of assets raises the consumption function sufficiently to start employment and output up again, prices and wages will cease falling, and the real value of assets will cease rising.\u2026 Thus the deflation of prices (which \u00e0 la Pigou is supposed to continue to cause an ever increasing real value of liquid assets until full employment is reached) stops at the lower turning point. The force that is supposed to drive the economy into full employment already peters out once the lower turning point is reached.2\n2 Ibid., p. 535.\n\nHansen derived his criticism from the well\u2010known article on the Pigou effect by Don Patinkin, \u201cPrice Flexibility and Full Employment.\u201d3\n3 Don Patinkin, \u201cPrice Flexibility and Full Employment,\u201d American Economic Review, XXXVIII (1948), 543\u201364; reprinted with addendum in Readings in Monetary Theory, ed. F. Lutz and L. Mints (Philadelphia: Blakiston Co., 1951). Page references will be to this latter source.\n\nAssuming a fixed stock of money, no adverse liquidity effects, and a flexible price level, Patinkin's argument runs, a falling price level will augment the real value of the stock of money and lead to a shifting of the consumption function to the left (less will be saved out of given alternative incomes). In effect, Hansen questions whether this shift will be large enough to re\u2010establish a full\u2010employment level of spending and, therefore, income.\nIn concentrating his attention on the behavior of the consumption function, Hansen seems to have overlooked another facet of Patinkin's (Pigou's) argument, namely, the real balance effect on savings. Patinkin states it thus:\nThe extent to which an individual wishes to save out of current income for reasons other than the desire for future income is inversely related to the real value of his cash balances. If this is sufficiently large, all his secondary desires for saving will be fully satisfied. At this point the only reason he will continue to save out of current income is the primary one of anticipated future interest payments. In other words, if the real value of cash balances is sufficiently large, the savings function becomes zero at a positive rate of interest, regardless of the income level.4\n4 Patinkin, op. cit., p. 259.\n\nFig. 1\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nProbably a diagram of the relevant functions at this point would clarify the arguments. In order to keep the ideas clear, let us assume straight\u2010line functions. We start from a full\u2010employment income,\nY\na\n, a result of consumption spending and investment spending from the functions\nC\n1\nand\nI\n1\n. The savings and investment functions are simply \u201crolled\u201d 180\u00b0 from their normal position and made integral with the consumption function. Thus the vertical axis in Figure 1 is either +C or \u2014S above the x\u0201axis and is +S or +I below the x\u0201axis. All values are in \u201creal\u201d terms.\nThe consumption function is drawn for a given real stock of money,\nM\n0\n/\nP\n1\nand the savings function is drawn for a given real stock of money and a given interest rate,\nr\na\n. Thus both savings and consumption are functions of three variables: income, the rate of interest, and the real stock of money. The relationship of savings to the rate of interest is presented in Figure 2, in which savings are graphed as a function of the rate of interest, given income, and the real stock of money. The real stock of money itself is simply a given nominal stock of money with respect to some given price level. If the price level rises (falls), the real stock of money would then fall (rise).\nFig. 2\nOpen in figure viewerPowerPoint\nLet us start by assuming that the economy is operating at a full\u2010employment income,\nY\na\nwith an exogenous investment function,\nI\n1\n, intersecting the savings function,\nS\n1\n, at this income. Now let investment fall to\nI\n2\n\u2014the normal Keynesian shift that is supposed to give us an equilibrium income of less\u2010than\u2010full employment.\nWe should note at this point that we do not \u201cneed\u201d the real balances effect to get an upward turning point. That is, even the pure Keynesian model will stabilize at income level\nY\nb\n. Therefore, Hansen's argument uses up the real balance effect before it is even needed.\nNow let us assume that the price level falls to\nP\n2\n. With a fixed nominal stock of money,5\n5 The nominal stock of money is, of course, subject to much variation; and much of the variation is positively elastic with respect to income variations, as a result of the expansion and contraction of credit by the fractional reserve banking system. I have discussed this point in another paper, \u201cPatinkin and the Pigou Effect,\u201d Review of Economics and Statistics, August, 1957.\n\nM\n0\n, the real stock of money will increase to\nM\n0\n/\nP\n2\n, shifting the consumption function up or to the left, simply indicating that more will be consumed at various levels of income. The rationale of this position is that the increased real stock of money is quasi\u2010capital gains income and will thus result in greater consumption. Since a lower turning point had already been reached, may we not presume that we are now headed back toward full employment? At least we shall be at some intermediate position between\nY\nb\nand\nY\na\n.\nFinally, we have the effect of cash\u2010balance changes on savings. As the real stock of money increases with the falling price level, the public's \u201csecondary\u201d desires for savings will be satisfied by the greater stock of money it is holding. Therefore, there will be less savings at various possible interest rates, implying that the savings function in Figure 2 will shift from\nS\n1\nto\nS\n2\n.6\n6 For an extended discussion of this point see Vera Lutz, \u201cReal and Monetary Factors in the Determination of Employment Levels,\u201d Quarterly Journal of Economics, LXVI (May, 1952), 263.\n\nBut a shift in the savings function must also be shown in Figure 1. Such is shown by a shift in the savings function in Figure 1 from\nS\n2\nto\nS\n3\n. Of course, the consumption must also shift up to\nC\n3\n. And income is now in equilibrium at\nY\na\n\u2032\n, a position which appears on the diagram to be \u201cover\u201d full employment but which is not necessarily any specific level of income until we know the magnitudes of the variables involved. That is, we must know the actual flexibility of prices and the reactions of consumption and savings to them.\nIf we allow ourselves to introduce an accelerator, that is, if we presume that investment is some function of consumption, we have cause for a shift in the investment function back toward its original position. But we are not limited to relying on this accelerator for an upward push after the turning point. Both the consumption and the savings functions will provide a stimulus; and it is this that Hansen failed to take account of. In brief, there are many combinations of investment (= savings) and consumption spending which could give us a full\u2010employment level of national income. And even though we cannot say that full employment is necessarily reached, we have forces in reserve which do not \u201cpeter out once the lower turning point is reached.\u201d7\n7 Both the accelerator action through the consumption function from increased real balances and the shifting of the savings function make\nY\nb\non the diagram an equilibrium income which is unstable.\n\nWith respect to monetary policy, the real\u2010value\u2010of\u2010balances theory in effect says that we can get any price level and any level of business activity we want by manipulating the stock of money. (A priori, it would seem that if we could get a real stock of money and corresponding level of activity by altering the nominal stock of money, we should be able to get the same effect by letting the price level fluctuate around a given stock of money.)\nPractically, we should note, first, that we do not have a fixed stock of money and, second, that we do not have a fixed stock of \u201cliquidity,\u201d primarily because of the operations of the fractional reserve banking system.8\n8 Cf. n. 5.\n\nFurther, our economy is not static but shows year\u2010to\u2010year increases in both total productivity per capita and the total number of people sharing this greater productivity. Therefore, in order that economic stability may be maintained at full employment with a reasonably stable price level, some part of the stock of liquid assets must be increased at a fairly constant rate.9\n9 Velocity, of course, can vary independently of the changes in the stock of money. However, velocity has been surprisingly constant during full\u2010employment periods. That is, the value of velocity for 1956 is very close to that for 1929. In fact, the secular trend for velocity from the 1890's to the present shows only a slight downward tilt, although there was an appreciable dip during the 1930's and 1940's.\n\nSince an increase in the real value of liquid balances may take place either by an increase in M or a decrease in P, or a combination of changes in both, we have no good reason for following the austere alternative which calls for P to do all the \u201cwork.\u201d In fact, the analysis of the Pigou effect is simply an exercise for getting the relevant variables delineated and does not imply recourse to any particular policy. It shows only what may be expected under the most simplified conditions.\nAt present, Federal Reserve System purchases of government securities in the open market is the principal means that our economy has for augmenting the stock of money. The alchemy, \u201cpainlessly\u201d exercised by the Federal Reserve banks, of purchasing assets of a lower order of liquidity\u2014i.e., government securities\u2014and emitting liquid liabilities of a higher order\u2014i.e., Federal Reserve Notes or member\u2014bank reserves\u2010is certainly capable of giving the economy in the long run, as well as in the short run, the liquidity impulses it needs to satisfy the cash\u2010balance demands of the public without recourse to falling prices, even if other minor factors in the balance sheet behave contrariwise.10\n10 In the unlikely event that all the outstanding public debt was finally \u201cmonetized\u201d by the purchases of the Federal Reserve banks, additional debt would have to be made available by yearly fiscal deficits.\n\nOne common charge against the effectiveness of monetary policy on the banking system is that greater reserves in the hands of the banks will result only in \u201cbank hoarding.\u201d We should note, however, that, although the behavior of banks is less predictable than that of people\u2014since banks have to hold only fractional reserves against liquid liabilities\u2014they are not likely to build up an infinite stock of liquidity either. They, too, will be faced with an inducement to disinvest cash balances for more attractive, income\u2010earning assets.\nHansen, in his discussion of policy, surprisingly seems to regard the banking system as dynamically \u201cneutral.\u201d He says: \u201cBank created money involves both assets and liabilities which balance each other off.\u201d11\n11 Op. cit., p. 535. My italics.\n\nAnd on the next page he implies the same kind of error when he says: \u201cA mere monetization of publicly owned securities will, however, not increase total liquid asset holdings.\u201c12\n12 Op. cit., p. 536.\n\nAlthough Hansen is perfectly correct in holding that a Pigou effect would not be involved as the banking system expands and contracts, dramatic positive shifts in the coefficients of liquidity of the total asset structure of the economy would certainly take place. The same would hold for monetization of the public debt. These qualitative shifts in liquidity may be even more important, under some conditions, than the quantitative changes subsumed under the Pigou analysis.",
