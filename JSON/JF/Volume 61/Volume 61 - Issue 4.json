            "abstract": "The study of household finance is challenging because household behavior is difficult to measure, and households face constraints not captured by textbook models. Evidence on participation, diversification, and mortgage refinancing suggests that many households invest effectively, but a minority make significant mistakes. This minority appears to be poorer and less well educated than the majority of more successful investors. There is some evidence that households understand their own limitations and avoid financial strategies for which they feel unqualified. Some financial products involve a cross\u2010subsidy from naive to sophisticated households, and this can inhibit welfare\u2010improving financial innovation.",

            "abstract": "The book\u2010to\u2010market effect is often interpreted as evidence of high expected returns on stocks of \u201cdistressed\u201d firms with poor past performance. We dispute this interpretation. We find that while a stock's future return is unrelated to the firm's past accounting\u2010based performance, it is strongly negatively related to the \u201cintangible\u201d return, the component of its past return that is orthogonal to the firm's past performance. Indeed, the book\u2010to\u2010market ratio forecasts returns because it is a good proxy for the intangible return. Also, a composite equity issuance measure, which is related to intangible returns, independently forecasts returns.",

We predict that a wave of investor sentiment has larger effects on securities whose valuations are highly subjective and difficult to arbitrage. Consistent with this prediction, we find that when beginning\u2010of\u2010period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent returns are relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non\u2010dividend\u2010paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines the capital structure implications of market timing. I isolate timing attempts in a single major financing event, the initial public offering, by identifying market timers as firms that go public in hot issue markets. I find that hot\u2010market IPO firms issue substantially more equity, and lower their leverage ratios by more, than cold\u2010market firms do. However, immediately after going public, hot\u2010market firms increase their leverage ratios by issuing more debt and less equity relative to cold\u2010market firms. At the end of the second year following the IPO, the impact of market timing on leverage completely vanishes.",

Using standard simulation techniques, we find that the bias is much too small to account for the observed predictive power of the equity share in new issues, corporate investment plans, insider trading, dividend initiations, or the maturity of corporate debt issues.",

We show that a structural break in excess bond returns during the early 1980s generates a spurious correlation between the fraction of long\u2010term debt in total debt issues and future excess bond returns. Contrary to Baker, Taliaferro, and Wurgler (2006), we show that the presence of structural breaks can lead to nonsense regressions, whether or not there is any small sample bias. Tests using firm\u2010level data further confirm that managers are unable to time the debt market successfully.",

Using a sample of 714 acquisitions during 1990 to 1998, we find that 47% of CEOs of acquiring firms are replaced within 5 years, including 27% by internal governance, 16% by takeovers, and 4% by bankruptcy. A significant inverse relation exists between bidder returns and the likelihood of CEO turnover. This relation is not associated with governance structure. It also is not significantly different in stock versus cash acquisitions, which appears to be inconsistent with Shleifer and Vishny's theory of \u201cstock market driven\u201d acquisitions.",

Oyer (2004, Journal of Finance 59, 1619\u20131649) posits that an absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO's reservation wages from outside employment opportunities vary with the economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer's (2004) theory. We argue that the CEO's outside opportunities depend on his talent, as proxied by the CEO's financial press visibility and his firm's industry\u2010adjusted ROA. Our results are robust to alternate explanations such as managerial skimming, oligopoly, and asymmetric benchmarking.",

However, the precision of the board's screening information is controlled by the CEO. Moreover, both the CEO and the board have career concerns that interact. The board's career concerns cause it to distort its investment recommendation procyclically, whereas the CEO's career concerns cause her to sometimes reduce the precision of the board's information. Moreover, the CEO sometimes prefers a less able board, and this happens only during economic upturns, suggesting that corporate governance will be weaker during economic upturns.",

            "abstract": "In theory, better access to bank credit can reduce or increase output volatility depending on whether firms are more financially constrained during contractions or expansions. This paper finds that the volatility of industrial output is lower in countries with more bank credit. Most of the reduction in volatility is idiosyncratic, which follows from the ability of banks to pool and diversify shocks. Systematic volatility is reduced less strongly. Volatility dampening is achieved via countercyclical borrowing: At the firm level, short\u2010term borrowing is less (or more negatively) correlated with sales and inventories in countries with high levels of bank credit.",

Explanations based on chance, measurement error, capital structure, and persistent in\u2010sample cash flow shocks do not explain this finding. Drawing on work in industrial organization, we posit that either barriers to entry in highly concentrated industries insulate firms from undiversifiable distress risk, or firms in highly concentrated industries are less risky because they engage in less innovation, and thereby command lower expected returns. Additional time\u2010series tests support these risk\u2010based interpretations.",

By examining the variation in excess stock returns over the fiscal year, we find that the marginal value of cash declines with larger cash holdings, higher leverage, better access to capital markets, and as firms choose greater cash distribution via dividends rather than repurchases.",

The local comovement of stock returns is not explained by economic fundamentals and is stronger for smaller firms with more individual investors and in regions with less financially sophisticated residents.

I use data on mutual fund holdings to construct a new measure of reference purchasing prices for individual stocks, and I show that post\u2010announcement price drift is most severe whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The magnitude of the drift depends on the capital gains (losses) experienced by the stock holders on the event date. An event\u2010driven strategy based on this effect yields monthly alphas of over 200 basis points.",
