            "abstract": "Due to their low trading costs, exchange\u2010traded funds (ETFs) are a potential catalyst for short\u2010horizon liquidity traders. The liquidity shocks can propagate to the underlying securities through the arbitrage channel, and ETFs may increase the nonfundamental volatility of the securities in their baskets. We exploit exogenous changes in index membership and find that stocks with higher ETF ownership display significantly higher volatility. ETF ownership increases the negative autocorrelation in stock prices. The increase in volatility appears to introduce undiversifiable risk in prices because stocks with high ETF ownership earn a significant risk premium of up to 56 basis points monthly.",

            "abstract": "When unscheduled news arrives, investors react with a stochastic delay yet still may exploit new information. In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book. News therefore arrives at random times. Following news, order flows become unbalanced and market depth is consumed, leading to positive covariance between price variability, trading volume, and order book unbalances. Holding the unconditional price variability constant, news frequency has a negative effect on both market depth and the variability\u2010volume covariance.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the role of disagreement in amplifying housing cycles. Speculation is easier in the land market than in the housing market due to frictions that make renting less efficient than owner\u2010occupancy. As a result, undeveloped land facilitates construction and intensifies the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices. This observation challenges the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller. It can also explain why the largest house price booms in the United States between 2000 and 2006 occurred in areas with elastic housing supply.",

Activists target deals with low premiums and those susceptible to managerial conflicts of interest, including going\u2010private deals and deals in which CEOs receive outsized payments. Activist arbitrageurs are associated with a significant decrease in the probability that targets will be sold to the announced bidders, and an increase in the premium paid, both ex post among surviving deals and ex ante among all deals. Activist arbitrage serves as a governance mechanism in M&A and earns higher returns than passive arbitrage.",

We show that, during this period, foreclosure starts on delinquent mortgages were delayed in the districts of committee members although there was no difference in delinquency rates between committee and noncommittee districts. In these areas, banks delayed the foreclosure starts by 0.5 months (relative to the 12\u2010month average). The estimated cost of delay to lenders is an order of magnitude greater than the campaign contributions by the political action committees of the largest mortgage servicing banks to the committee members in that period.",

We incorporate this empirical fact in a frictionless risk\u2010sharing model with recursive preferences, multiple countries, and multiple consumption goods whose supply features both global and local short\u2010 and long\u2010run shocks. Since news shocks are priced, heterogeneous exposure to long\u2010lasting global growth shocks results in a relevant reallocation of international resources and currency adjustments. Our unified framework replicates the properties of the HML\u2010FX and HML\u2010NFA carry\u2010trade strategies studied by Lustig, Roussanov, and Verdelhan and Della Corte, Riddiough, and Sarno.",

To this purpose, we develop a general equilibrium model with collateral constraints amenable to laboratory implementation and gather experimental data. In the laboratory, assets that can be leveraged fetch higher prices than assets that cannot, even though assets' payoffs are identical in all states of the world. Collateral value, therefore, creates deviations from the Law of One Price. The spread between collateralizeable and noncollateralizeable assets is significant and quantitatively close to theoretical predictions.",

Using financial data for a broad range of firms, our analysis suggests that this effect is driven by a shift in the composition of local bank credit supply toward more productive firms. We estimate that this effect translates into economically important gains in aggregate industry productivity and that changes in the allocation of labor play a central role in driving these gains.",

Individuals with high self\u2010efficacy are more likely to take precautions that mitigate adverse financial shocks. They are subsequently less likely to default on their debt and bill payments, especially after experiencing negative shocks such as job loss or illness. Thus, noncognitive abilities are an important determinant of financial fragility and subjective expectations are an important factor in household financial decisions.",

Moreover, sensation\u2010seeking managers trade more frequently, actively, and unconventionally, and prefer lottery\u2010like stocks. We show further that some investors are themselves susceptible to sensation seeking and that sensation\u2010seeking investors fuel the demand for sensation\u2010seeking managers. While investors perceive sensation seekers to be less competent, they do not fully appreciate the superior investment skills of sensation\u2010avoiding fund managers.",
