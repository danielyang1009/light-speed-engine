We show theoretically, numerically, and empirically that range\u2010based volatility proxies are not only highly efficient, but also approximately Gaussian and robust to microstructure noise. Hence range\u2010based Gaussian quasi\u2010maximum likelihood estimation produces highly efficient estimates of stochastic volatility models and extractions of latent volatility. We use our method to examine the dynamics of daily exchange rate volatility and find the evidence points strongly toward two\u2010factor models with one highly persistent factor and one quickly mean\u2010reverting factor.",

For a sample of large bank holding companies, we evaluate the performance of banks trading risk models by examining the statistical accuracy of the VaR forecasts. Although a substantial literature has examined the statistical and economic meaning of Value\u2010at\u2010Risk models, this article is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the performance of models actually in use.",

We show that, when investors must learn about expected cash flows, empirical tests can find patterns in the data that differ from those perceived by rational investors. Returns might appear predictable to an econometrician, or appear to deviate from the Capital Asset Pricing Model, but investors can neither perceive nor exploit this predictability. Returns may also appear excessively volatile even though prices react efficiently to cash\u2010flow news. We conclude that parameter uncertainty can be important for characterizing and testing market efficiency.",

The investor's optimal investment strategy and indirect utility are given in simple closed form. Hedge demands depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion and on the maturities of the bonds included in the portfolio. When short positions are precluded, the optimal strategy consists of investments in cash, equity, and a single nominal bond with optimally chosen maturity. Both the optimal stock\u2010bond mix and the optimal bond maturity depend on the investor's horizon and risk aversion.",

We find that any reasonably descriptive continuous\u2010time model for equity\u2010index returns must allow for discrete jumps as well as stochastic volatility with a pronounced negative relationship between return and volatility innovations. We also find that the dominant empirical characteristics of the return process appear to be priced by the option market. Our analysis indicates a general correspondence between the evidence extracted from daily equity\u2010index returns and the stylized features of the corresponding options market prices.",

An analysis of the most active Nasdaq stocks shows that ECNs not only post informative quotes, but also, compared to market makers, ECNs post quotes rapidly and are more often at the inside. Additionally, ECN quoted spreads are smaller than dealer quoted spreads. The evidence suggests that the proliferation of alternative trading venues, such as ECNs, may promote quote quality rather than fragmenting markets. Moreover, the results suggest that a more open book contributes to quote quality.",

The reform was structured in such a way that the immediate impact fell almost entirely on the largest investor class in the United Kingdom, namely pension funds. We find significant changes in the valuation of dividend income after the reform, in particular for high\u2010yielding companies. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that taxation affects the valuation of companies, and that pension funds were the effective marginal investors for high\u2010yielding companies.",

This paper presents an equilibrium model implying that the forward power price is a downward biased predictor of the future spot price if expected power demand is low and demand risk is moderate. However, the equilibrium forward premium increases when either expected demand or demand variance is high, because of positive skewness in the spot power price distribution. Preliminary empirical evidence indicates that the premium in forward power prices is greatest during the summer months.",

Using a sample of 500 firms over the 1980 to 1993 time period, we find that firms are relatively more likely to choose bank loans when variables that measure asymmetric information problems are elevated. The sensitivity of the likelihood of choosing bank debt to information problems is greater for firms with no public debt outstanding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that banks help alleviate asymmetric information problems and that firms weigh these information benefits against a wide range of contracting costs when choosing bank financing.",

We document a positive relationship between institutional allocation and day one IPO returns. This is partly explained by the practice of giving institutions more shares in IPOs with strong premarket demand, consistent with book\u2010building theories. However, institutional allocation also contains private information about first\u2010day IPO returns not reflected in premarket demand and other public information. Our evidence supports book\u2010building theories of IPO underpricing, but suggests that institutional allocation in underpriced issues is in excess of that explained by book\u2010building alone.",

In contrast, halts that reopen the following day with a longer 90\u2010minute quotation period are associated with insignificant spread effects and significantly dampened volatility effects. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased information transmission during the halt results in reduced posthalt uncertainty.",

We examine the extent to which the cross\u2010sectional data (five different instruments) provide information about the model. We find that the time\u2010series restrictions of the two\u2010factor model are generally consistent with the data. However, the model's cross\u2010sectional restrictions are not. We show that adding a third factor produces a significant statistical improvement, but causes the average time\u2010series fit to the yields themselves to deteriorate.",

The net asset flows continue to remain negative for the combined fund in the year following the merger. The likelihood of a fund merger is inversely related to fund size for both within\u2010and across\u2010family mutual fund mergers.
