            "abstract": "It is well known that firms are more likely to issue equity when their market values are high, relative to book and past market values, and to repurchase equity when their market values are low. We document that the resulting effects on capital structure are very persistent. As a consequence, current capital structure is strongly related to historical market values. The results suggest the theory that capital structure is the cumulative outcome of past attempts to time the equity market.",

We argue that since banks often lend via commitments, their lending and deposit\u2010taking may be two manifestations of one primitive function: the provision of liquidity on demand. There will be synergies between the two activities to the extent that both require banks to hold large balances of liquid assets: If deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can share the costs of the liquid\u2010asset stockpile. We develop this idea with a simple model, and use a variety of data to test the model empirically.",

A study of the 103 countries that have stock markets reveals that insider trading laws exist in 87 of them, but enforcement\u2014as evidenced by prosecutions\u2014has taken place in only 38 of them. Before 1990, the respective numbers were 34 and 9. We find that the cost of equity in a country, after controlling for a number of other variables, does not change after the introduction of insider trading laws, but decreases significantly after the first prosecution.",

Equity and foreign fund advisors receive higher marginal compensation than debt and domestic fund advisors. Advisors of funds with greater turnover receive higher marginal compensation. Also, closedend fund advisors receive higher marginal compensation than open\u2010end fund advisors. Finally, we find that marginal compensation is lower for advisors of large funds and members of large fund families. We argue that these differences in marginal compensation reflect differences in advisor marginal product, differences in the difficulty of monitoring performance, differences in control environments, and scale economies.",

The existing literature interprets these findings as inefficiencies arising from coordination problems among many creditors or an inefficient design of bankruptcy law. In contrast, this paper emphasizes that creditors lack the information that is needed to make quick and correct liquidation decisions. It can explain the long\u2010term nature of financial distress solely as the result of dynamic learning strategies of creditors and suggests that it may be an unavoidable byproduct of an efficient resolution of financial distress.",

Using a hand\u2010collected data set on Silicon Valley start\u2010ups, we find that venture capital is related to a variety of professionalization measures, such as human resource policies, the adoption of stock option plans, and the hiring of a marketing VP. Venture\u2010capital\u2010backed companies are also more likely and faster to replace the founder with an outside CEO, both in situations that appear adversarial and those mutually agreed to. The evidence suggests that venture capitalists play roles over and beyond those of traditional financial intermediaries.",

The VAR yields three main results. First, firm\u2010level stock returns are mainly driven by cash\u2010flow news. For a typical stock, the variance of cash\u2010flow news is more than twice that of expected\u2010return news. Second, shocks to expected returns and cash flows are positively correlated for a typical small stock. Third, expected\u2010return\u2010news series are highly correlated across firms, while cash\u2010flow news can largely be diversified away in aggregate portfolios.",

Higher government ownership of banks in 1970 is associated with slower subsequent financial development and lower growth of per capita income and productivity.

In addition, using data from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that households that are saving to invest in their own businesses or in their own homes indeed have significantly safer financial portfolios.",

Using information on individual loan contracts between banks and companies, I analyze the effect of banking consolidation on banks' credit policies. I find that inmarket mergers benefit borrowers if these mergers involve the acquisition of banks with small market shares. Interest rates charged by the consolidated banks decrease, but as the local market share of the acquired bank increases, the efficiency effect is offset by market power. Mergers have different distributional effects across borrowers. When banks become larger, they reduce the supply of loans to small borrowers.",

Our test results indicate that preference\u2010restricted nonlinear pricing kernels are both admissible for the cross section of returns and are able to significantly improve upon linear single\u2010 and multifactor kernels. Further, the nonlinearities in the pricing kernel drive out the importance of the factors in the linear multi\u2010factor model.",

The failure of these models is driven by one of their key features: Compensation for risk is a multiple of the variance of the risk. Thus risk compensation cannot vary independently of interest rate volatility. I also describe a broader class of models. These aessentially affine\u2010 models retain the tractability of standard models, but allow compensation for interest rate risk to vary independently of interest rate volatility. This additional flexibility proves useful in forecasting future yields.",

CEO turnover increased following issuance of the Code; the negative relationship between CEO turnover and performance became stronger following the Code's issuance; and the increase in sensitivity of turnover to performance was concentrated among firms that adopted the Code.",
