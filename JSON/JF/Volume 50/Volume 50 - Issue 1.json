            "abstract": "This article examines the performance of 197 public companies that emerged from Chapter 11. Over 40 percent of the sample firms continue to experience operating losses in the three years following bankruptcy; 32 percent reenter bankruptcy or privately restructure their debt. The continued involvement of prebankruptcy management in the restructuring process is strongly associated with poor post\u2010bankruptcy performance. The substantial number of firms emerging from Chapter 11 that are not viable or need further restructuring provides little evidence that the process effectively rehabilitates distressed firms and is consistent with the view that there are economically important biases toward continuation of unprofitable firms.",

During the five years after the issue, investors have received average returns of only 5 percent per year for companies going public and only 7 percent per year for companies conducting a seasoned equity offer. Book\u2010to\u2010market effects account for only a modest portion of the low returns. An investor would have had to invest 44 percent more money in the issuers than in nonissuers of the same size to have the same wealth five years after the offering date.",

The first is where the asset underlying the derivative security may default. The second is where the writer of the derivative security may default. We apply the foreign currency analogy of Jarrow and Turnbull (1991) to decompose the dollar payoff from a risky security into a certain payoff and a \u201cspot exchange rate.\u201d Arbitrage\u2010free valuation techniques are then employed. This methodology can be applied to corporate debt and over the counter derivatives, such as swaps and caps.",

For discretely\u2010sampled data, predictability is linked to the parameters that do enter the option pricing formula. We construct an adjustment for predictability to the Black\u2010Scholes formula and show that this adjustment can be important even for small levels of predictability, especially for longer maturity options. We propose several continuous\u2010time linear diffusion processes that can capture broader forms of predictability, and provide numerical examples that illustrate their importance for pricing options.",

Consistent with rational pricing, high BE/ME signals persistent poor earnings and low BE/ME signals strong earnings. Moreover, stock prices forecast the reversion of earnings growth observed after firms are ranked on size and BE/ME. Finally, there are market, size, and BE/ME factors in earnings like those in returns. The market and size factors in earnings help explain those in returns, but we find no link between BE/ME factors in earnings and returns.",

Many do not view these implications as separate, since either implies the other, but we demonstrate that either can hold nearly perfectly while the other fails grossly. If the index portfolio is inefficient, then the coefficients and\nR\n2\nfrom an ordinary least squares regression of expected returns on betas can equal essentially any values and bear no relation to the index portfolio's mean\u2010variance location. That location does determine the outcome of a mean\u2010beta regression fitted by generalized least squares.",

The relation between book\u2010to\u2010market equity and returns is weaker and less consistent than that in Fama and French (1992).

This article shows that these results can be deceptive when the process followed by inflation shifts infrequently. We characterize the shifts in inflation by a Markov switching model. Based upon this model's forecasts, we reexamine the long\u2010run relationship between nominal interest rates and inflation. Interestingly, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that in the long run nominal interest rates reflect expected inflation one\u2010for\u2010one.",

We find that the unconditional positive excess returns, first documented by Kalay and Loewenstein (1985), are higher for small\u2010firm and low\u2010priced stocks. Price volatility and trading volume also increase during this period. Examination of trade prices relative to the bid\u2010ask spread and volume of trades at bid and asked prices shows that the excess returns cannot be attributed to measurement errors or to spillover effects of tax\u2010related ex\u2010day trading. Rather, the price behavior is related to the absorption of dividend information.",

If venture capitalists are intensive monitors of managers, their involvement as directors should be more intense when the need for oversight is greater. I show that venture capitalists' representation on the board increases around the time of chief executive officer turnover, while the number of other outsiders remains constant. I also show that distance to the firm is an important determinant of the board membership of venture capitalists, as might be anticipated if the oversight of local firms is less costly than more distant businesses.",

We show that large institutions who can time their entry into the market will trade either at the open, or during periods of unusual demand pressures. We show that if these institutions do enter later in the day, they trade in the same direction as institutions which provide liquidity continuously; institutions therefore appear to exhibit \u201cherding\u201d behavior. We also explore how changing the uncertainty of demand pressures late in the day affects trading costs throughout the day.",

For metals, the degree of mean reversion is substantially less, but still statistically significant. We detect only weak evidence of mean reversion in financial asset prices.",
