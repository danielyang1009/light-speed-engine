This paper shows that underperformance is very likely to be observed ex\u2010post in an efficient market. The premise is that more firms issue equity at higher stock prices even though they cannot predict future returns. Ex\u2010post, issuers seem to time the market because offerings cluster at market peaks. Simulations based on 1973 through 1997 data reveal that when ex\u2010ante expected abnormal returns are zero, median ex\u2010post underperformance for equity issuers will be significantly negative in event\u2010time. Using calendar\u2010time returns solves the problem.",

Such policy depends on the presence and the size of severance pay in the CEO's compensation package and on the CEO's influence on the board of directors regarding his own replacement (i.e., entrenchment). We explain when and why the combination of some degree of entrenchment and a sizeable severance package is desirable. The analysis offers predictions about the correlation between entrenchment, severance pay, and incentive compensation.",

The remaining dispersion can be explained by expected 15\u2010year profitability and persistence of valuation levels. Furthermore, this fraction appears stable across time and across types of stocks. We also show that the expected return on value\u2010minus\u2010growth strategies is atypically high at times when their spread in book\u2010to\u2010market ratios is wide.",

We analyze historical long\u2010term growth rates across a broad cross section of stocks using several indicators of operating performance. We test for persistence and predictability in growth. While some firms have grown at high rates historically, they are relatively rare instances. There is no persistence in long\u2010term earnings growth beyond chance, and there is low predictability even with a wide variety of predictor variables. Specifically, IBES growth forecasts are overly optimistic and add little predictive power. Valuation ratios also have limited ability to predict future growth.",

We find evidence in support of this hypothesis based on a comparison of high short\u2010interest stocks and low short\u2010interest stocks, stocks with and without actively traded options, IPOs, zero short\u2010interest stocks, and highly volatile stocks.",

In particular, the sensitivity is higher for firms with high growth rates and low dividend payout ratios.

We show that the regime shift in initial returns and other elements of pricing behavior can be at least partially accounted for by marked changes in pre\u2010IPO ownership structure and insider selling behavior over the period, which reduced key decision makers' incentives to control underpricing. After controlling for these changes, the difference in underpricing between 1999 and 2000 and the preceding three years is much reduced. Our results suggest that it was firm characteristics that were unique during the \u201cdot\u2010com bubble\u201d and that pricing behavior followed from incentives created by these characteristics.",

When implied volatilities are graphed against a standard measure of moneyness, the implied volatility smirk does not flatten out as maturity increases up to the observable horizon of two years. This behavior contrasts sharply with the implications of many pricing models and with the asymptotic behavior implied by the central limit theorem (CLT). We develop a parsimonious model which deliberately violates the CLT assumptions and thus captures the observed behavior of the volatility smirk over the maturity horizon. Calibration exercises demonstrate its superior performance against several widely used alternatives.",

Funds with incentive fees exhibit positive stock selection ability, but a beta less than one results in funds not earning positive fees. From an investor's perspective, positive alphas plus lower expense ratios make incentive\u2010fee funds attractive. However, incentive\u2010fee funds take on more risk than non\u2010incentive\u2010fee funds, and they increase risk after a period of poor performance. Incentive fees are useful marketing tools, since more new cash flows go into incentive\u2010fee funds than into non\u2010incentive\u2010fee funds, ceteris paribus.",

Market prices of risky assets are significantly higher if feedback frequency and decision flexibility are reduced. This result supports the findings from individual decision making, and shows that market interactions do not eliminate such behavior or its consequences for prices.",
