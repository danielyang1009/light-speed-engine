            "abstract": "The repo market has been viewed as a potential source of financial instability since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, based in part on findings that margins increased sharply in a segment of this market. This paper provides evidence suggesting that there was no system\u2010wide run on repo. Using confidential data on tri\u2010party repo, a major segment of this market, we show that, the level of margins and the amount of funding were surprisingly stable for most borrowers during the crisis. However, we also document a sharp decline in the tri\u2010party repo funding of Lehman in September 2008.",

Consistent with a run, repo volume backed by private asset\u2010backed securities falls to near zero in the crisis. However, the reduction is only $182 billion, which is small relative to the stock of private asset\u2010backed securities as well as the contraction in asset\u2010backed commercial paper. While the repo contraction is small in aggregate, it disproportionately affected a few dealer banks.",

Consistent with theory, we find that firms' stock returns increase with credit risk premia estimated from CDS spreads. Credit risk premia contain information not captured by physical or risk\u2010neutral default probabilities alone. This sheds new light on the \u201cdistress puzzle\u201d\u2014the lack of a positive relation between equity returns and default probabilities\u2014reported in previous studies.",

We find that an increase in macroeconomic volatility is associated with an increase in discount rates and a decline in consumption. We develop a framework in which cash flow, discount rate, and volatility risks determine risk premia and show that volatility plays a significant role in explaining the joint dynamics of returns to human capital and equity. Volatility risk carries a sizable positive risk premium and helps account for the cross section of expected returns. Our evidence demonstrates that volatility is important for understanding expected returns and macroeconomic fluctuations.",

We find that a typical target is valued higher by strategic bidders. However, 22.4% of targets in our sample are valued higher by financial bidders. These are mature, poorly performing companies. We also find that (i) valuations of different strategic bidders are more dispersed and (ii) valuations of financial bidders are correlated with aggregate economic conditions. Our results suggest that different targets appeal to different types of bidders, rather than that strategic bidders always value targets more because of synergies.",

We use a factor model to predict crisis returns, defining unexplained increases in factor loadings and residual correlations as indicative of contagion. While we find evidence of contagion from the United States and the global financial sector, the effects are small. By contrast, there has been substantial contagion from domestic markets to individual domestic portfolios, with its severity inversely related to the quality of countries\u2019 economic fundamentals. This confirms the \u201cwake\u2010up call\u201d hypothesis, with markets focusing more on country\u2010specific characteristics during the crisis.",

When two competitors in a product market merge, their products converge in quality, and prices fall relative to the competition. These effects take two to three years to be fully realized and are stronger in mature industries. Prices do not fall, however, when the acquirer is diversifying into a new product market. This direct evidence of real changes induced by merger activity is consistent with consolidation by related merging firms to achieve operational efficiencies and lower costs.",

Increased sovereign credit risk in turn weakens the financial sector by eroding the value of its government guarantees and bond holdings. Using credit default swap (CDS) rates on European sovereigns and banks, we show that bailouts triggered the rise of sovereign credit risk in 2008. We document that post\u2010bailout changes in sovereign CDS explain changes in bank CDS even after controlling for aggregate and bank\u2010level determinants of credit spreads, confirming the sovereign\u2010bank loop.",

In this paper, we examine the importance of accounting for investment options in models of credit risk. In the presence of financing and investment frictions, firm\u2010level variables that proxy for asset composition are significant determinants of credit spreads beyond leverage and asset volatility, because they capture the systematic risk of firms' assets. Cross\u2010sectional studies of credit spreads that fail to control for the interdependence of leverage and investment decisions are unlikely to be very informative. Such frictions also give rise to a realistic term structure of credit spreads in a production economy.",

We calculate pay duration in various industries and document its correlation with firm characteristics. Pay duration is longer in firms with more growth opportunities, more long\u2010term assets, greater R&D intensity, lower risk, and better recent stock performance. Longer CEO pay duration is negatively related to the extent of earnings\u2010increasing accruals.",
