            "abstract": "This paper describes an empirical study of over 4000 specific share return forecasts made by 35 UK stockbrokers and by the internal analysts of a large UK investment institution. A comparison of forecast and realised returns reveals a small but potentially useful degree of forecasting ability. A large part of the information content of the forecasts, however, appears to be discounted in the market place within the first month. Nevertheless, an analysis of some 3000 transactions motivated by, and executed at the time of, the forecasts shows that the apparent predictive ability of the recommendations could be translated into superior performance by the fund's investment managers. Differences in forecasting ability between brokers do not appear to persist over time, but predictive accuracy can be improved by pooling simultaneous forecasts from different sources.",

In the course of this analysis and as a secondary purpose, the paper discusses general considerations involving the use of expectations proxies and makes recommendations for econometric techniques. The main empirical findings are: (1) Hypothesized relationships between expected economic activity and expected inflation do not in practice appear to be important in explaining the negative relationship between expected inflation and stock returns. (2) Nevertheless, the survey data do lend some support to the hypothesis of a quantity theory relationship between expected inflation and expected economic activity, holding constant monetary growth. (3) The cross\u2010forecaster dispersion of economic activity forecasts, a proxy for real uncertainty, appears to be a significant determinant of stock returns. Inclusion of this variable eliminates the negative impact of expected inflation.",

However, virtually no empirical documentation exists concerning the best method for estimating the correlation structure of international share prices. In this paper, 12 models for estimating the international correlation matrix are presented and empirically tested relative to full historical extrapolation. The major evaluation criteria are the mean squared error and stochastic dominance based on the frequency distribution of the squared forecast errors. The results indicate that the National Mean Model strictly dominates all the others in terms of forecasting accuracy.",

The results fail to support the hypothesis that the beta is a convex function of the degree of international involvement. Finally, the paper provides some preliminary evidence on the effect of corporate international diversification on shareholders' returns. It is found that abnormal returns rise by some 18 percent during the 14 months preceding the initial foreign diversification.",

British data offer great potential to illuminate the dividends and taxes question, since there have been two radical changes and several minor reforms in British dividend tax policy during the last 30 years. Studying the relationship between dividends and stock price movements during different tax regimes offers an ideal controlled experiment for assessing the effects of taxes on investors' valuation of dividends. Using daily data on a small sample of firms, and monthly data on a much broader sample, we find clear evidence that taxes affect the equilibrium relationship between dividend yields and market returns. These findings suggest that taxes are important determinants of security market equilibrium and deepen the puzzle of why firms pay dividends.",

The price structure of interest revolves around a \u201cpricing\u2010hypothesis\u201d: the prices in an economy with less information are unbiased estimators of the prices that would obtain in a more informative economy. Two basic results are developed. First, if the incremental information is useless then the pricing\u2010hypothesis applies. Second, if the pricing hypothesis is assumed valid, then the information is valuable in a weak sense. The results are also considered in the context of empirical research.

The proposed method has the simplicity of a mean\u2010variance model and the main features of stochastic dominance efficiency. Since mean\u2010Gini is consistent with investor behavior under uncertainty for a wide class of probability distributions, Gini's mean difference is shown to be more adequate than the variance for evaluating the variability of a prospect. The MG approach is then applied to capital markets and the security valuation theorem is derived as a general relationship between average return and risk. This is further extended to include a degree of risk aversion that can be estimated from capital market data. The analysis is concluded with the concentration ratio to allow for the classification of different securities with respect to their relative riskiness.",

This raises some concerns on the acceptability of their conclusions. For our study, we employ inter\u2010battery factor analysis which enables us to estimate factor loadings by constraining the factors to be the same between two different groups. Our results show that there seem to be five or six inter\u2010group common factors that generate daily returns for two industry groups of securities, and these inter\u2010group common factors do not seem to depend on the size of groups. Also, based on our cross\u2010sectional tests on the risk premia, we conclude that the APT should not be rejected.",
