We use transactions data of a representative scalper to identify the source of scalper earnings. We find that scalpers provide liquidity services to incoming market orders, thereby facilitating commercial hedging. Scalper earnings are positively related to the bid\u2010asked spread and negatively related to the length of time a position is held.",

With replication of market conditions, the predictions of a rational expectations equilibrium model are relatively accurate whether or not futures markets are present. However, the presence of futures markets increases the speed with which an efficient equilibrium is achieved. While this more rapid adjustment can increase the variance of spot market prices as they move to equilibrium, this increased variance reflects efficiency gains due to better information.",

The possibility of arbitrage between securities priced at market value and amortized MMFs is investigated. It is found that significant dilution has taken place as a result of this valuation technique. Losses per share have been about 10 basis points per year. Evidence that arbitrageurs will take advantage of a misvaluation of the MMF and cause losses to other shareholders may suggest that some investors should reconsider the desirability of amortized MMFs for their investments.",

It must characterize any infinite asset economy in which no arbitrage opportunities are present whether or not the factor model has uncorrelated residuals. This result provides the intuition for the role of residual risk in the pricing model and eliminates some classes of arbitrage opportunities still present under Huberman's bound. Some applications to empirical tests and performance measurement are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Prevailing theories in finance and economics suggest that leases and debt are substitutes; an increase in one should led to a compensating decrease in the other. In particular, there are three views on the magnitude of the substitution coefficient. Standard finance theory treats cash flows from lease obligations as equivalent to debt cash flows, thus describing the tradeoff between debt and leases as one\u2010to\u2010one. Others are willing to use a tradeoff of leases for debt which is less than, but close to, one. The rationale for a dollar of leases using less of debt capacity than a dollar of debt obligation is based upon the differences in the terms and nature of lease and debt contracts. Finally, there are some who argue that since leased assets may be firm\u2010specific, the risk of moral hazard may be great, resulting in a tradeoff of greater than one\u2010to\u2010one; that is, a dollar of a lease obligation uses more of debt capacity than a dollar of a debt obligation.\nA series of empirical tests are performed in this study on samples of approximately 600 firms, covering the years 1976 through 1981, with none of the three views supported by the results. Instead, the results indicate that leases and debt are complements; greater use of debt is associated with a greater use of leasing. This finding reappears consistently for each year, each definition of leverage ratios, and each approach to analysis. This complementary relationship persists even after refinements are made to the estimation technique.",

First, there is a need to provide further evidence as to the size of bankruptcy costs. Second, for the first time a proxy methodology for measuring indirect costs of bankruptcy is presented and actually measured. Third, a simple format for measuring the present value of expected bankruptcy costs is compared with the present value of expected tax benefits from interest payments on leverage. This comparison has important implications for the continuing debate as to whether or not an optimum capital structure exists for corporations.",

The results indicate that the unanticipated components of the announced changes in the Producers Price Index and in the money supply have an immediate positive effect on short\u2010term interest rates. The Consumer Price Index announcement has no apparent effect. There is no evidence of a delayed announcement effect.
