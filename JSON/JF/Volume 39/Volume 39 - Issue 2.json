There is a general nonequivalence of factor analyzing small groups of securities and factor analyzing a group of securities sufficiently large for the APT model to hold. It is found that as one increases the number of securities, the number of \u201cfactors\u201d determined increases. This increase in the number of \u201cfactors\u201d with larger groups of securities cannot readily be explained by a distinction between \u201cpriced\u201d and \u201cnonpriced\u201d risk factors as it is impermissible to carry out tests on whether a given \u201crisk factor is priced\u201d using factor analytic procedures.",

The producer makes his production decisions at the beginning of the period and realizes his return at the end of the time interval. During the period, he faces both price and output uncertainties. In applying stochastic dynamic programming methods, this paper shows the effect of these risks on his consumption behavior. Further, the paper investigates his optimal hedging positions in the futures market over time and his optimal production decisions. Finally, implications of these results on the futures markets are discussed.",

While the studies recognized the potential impacts of nontrading and price\u2010adjustment delays in general, no formal analyses of such impacts were presented; in this paper analytic results are presented for the articulation between these phenomena. The implications of the analysis are discussed and shown to be consistent with a sample of U.K. index data. A modified form of the negative weekend effect is found to be present in the U.K. data analyzed.",

The derived demand function was found to correspond to behavior appropriate to the unknown switchpoint switching regression problem. When estimated, parameters generally conformed to theoretical expectations. The model was also tested for existence of switching regression behavior against a model similar to Goldfeld and Kane [12]. Significance exceeded 99% in all cases. With the advent of reserve intermediate targeting, it appears especially necessary to reinvestigate the behavior determining this important source of reserves.",

The future investment opportunity set may be uncertain, provided that in every period a specific market portfolio variable depending on preferences is known as of the preceding date. This variable need not be completely deterministic.\nSecond, conditions for a serially independent market excess return are derived. These conditions render serial independence very unlikely. Hence estimation methods assuming serial independence are likely to yield biased results.",

Such \u201cbiases\u201d have been found related to the exercise price, the time to maturity, and the variance. We argue here that the American option variant of the Black\u2010Scholes formula has the potential to explain the first two biases and may partly explain the third. It can also be used to understand the empirical finding that the striking price bias reverses itself in different sample periods. The expected form of the striking price bias is explained in detail and is shown to be closely related to past empirical findings.",

A model is developed in which the decision to use multiple managers is explicitly treated, and conditions are studied such that an increase or decrease in the number of managers would be desirable. Under some conditions, a multiple manager solution is preferred over a single manager solution.",

The observed relation between real ex post stock returns and inflation is shown to be consistent with equilibrium in an economy with rational investors. The relation between expected real returns and expected inflation is shown to depend on the form of the economy's production function and on the form of investor preferences. When the production function exhibits stochastic constant returns to scale, the model explains the negative relation between expected real returns and expected inflation which has frequently been observed in empirical studies.",

Specifically, demand premiums created by banks may stabilize bond yields in some maturity ranges but not in others; for example, short\u2010term municipals may be stabilized but not long\u2010term. This research implies that bank demand behavior may create demand premiums that stabilize prices of short\u2010term municipal bonds relative to those of Treasury bonds of like maturity.
