We show that overconfidence implies negative long\u2010lag autocorrelations, excess volatility, and, when managerial actions are correlated with stock mispricing, public\u2010event\u2010based return predictability. Biased self\u2010attribution adds positive short\u2010lag autocorrelations (\u201cmomentum\u201d), short\u2010run earnings \u201cdrift,\u201d but negative correlation between future returns and long\u2010term past stock market and accounting performance. The theory also offers several untested implications and implications for corporate financial policy.",

This paper examines markets in which price\u2010taking traders, a strategic\u2010trading insider, and risk\u2010averse marketmakers are overconfident. Overconfidence increases expected trading volume, increases market depth, and decreases the expected utility of overconfident traders. Its effect on volatility and price quality depend on who is overconfident. Overconfident traders can cause markets to underreact to the information of rational traders. Markets also underreact to abstract, statistical, and highly relevant information, and they overreact to salient, anecdotal, and less relevant information.",

The impact of cross\u2010listing is complex\u2014balancing the costs of order flow migration against the benefits of increased intermarket competition. These effects are exacerbated by equity investment barriers that induce segmentation of the domestic equity market.

The magnitude of the yield effect is too large to be explained by a \u201ctax penalty\u201d on dividend income and is not explained by previously documented anomalies.

Using S&P 500 options from June 1988 through December 1993, we examine the predictive and hedging performance of the DVF option valuation model and find it is no better than an ad hoc procedure that merely smooths Black\u2013Scholes (1973) implied volatilities across exercise prices and times to expiration.",

We show that in countries whose legal systems score high on an efficiency index, a greater proportion of firms use long\u2010term external financing. An active, though not necessarily large, stock market and a large banking sector are also associated with externally financed firm growth. The increased reliance on external financing occurs in part because established firms in countries with well\u2010functioning institutions have lower profit rates. Government subsidies to industry do not increase the proportion of firms relying on external financing.",

Banks that issue common stock involuntarily experience values for these measures that are not significantly different from those of the benchmark firm(s).",

In the months after distribution, returns apparently continue to be negative. When the short\u2010 and long\u2010run reactions are decomposed, they are consistent with the view that venture capitalists use inside information to time stock distributions: Distributions of firms brought public by lower quality underwriters and of less seasoned firms have more negative price reactions.",

We find large and significant abnormal returns around the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 which imply it created $85 billion of value in the banking industry. Consistent with an active market for corporate control allowing beneficial consolidation and providing needed discipline, there is a strong negative relationship between banks' abnormal returns and their prior performance. Consistent with managerial entrenchment limiting takeover discipline, banks with higher insider ownership, lower outside block ownership, and/or less independent boards have lower abnormal returns.",

Short sales executed near the end of the financial year and those related to arbitrage and hedging activities are associated with a smaller price reaction; trades near information events precipitate larger price reactions.

Although yield spreads on both callable and noncallable corporate bonds fall when Treasury yields rise, this relation is much stronger for callable bonds.

The theory of investment under uncertainty implies that political uncertainty may simultaneously increase volatility and reduce output. Though cause and effect are typically hard to separate, the transition from Imperial to Weimar Germany offers a natural experiment because major political events left clear traces on stock prices. Current and past increases in volatility are associated with output declines, consistent with U.S. experience. However, political events are more clearly the source of volatility, and the results support the view that the relationship between volatility and output reflects the joint effects of political factors.",
