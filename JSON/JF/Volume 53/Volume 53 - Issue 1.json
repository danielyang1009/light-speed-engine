Companies appear to go public not to finance future investments and growth, but to rebalance their accounts after high investment and growth.

We investigate the hypothesis that a liquid stock market reduces large shareholders' incentives to monitor because it allows them to sell their stocks more easily. Even though this is true, a liquid market also makes it less costly to hold larger stakes and easier to purchase additional shares. We show that this fact is important if monitoring is costly: market liquidity mitigates the problem that small shareholders free ride on the effort of the large shareholder. We find that liquid stock markets are beneficial because they make corporate governance more effective.",

Intervention increases the value of the institution's existing shareholdings, but intervention only increases the institution's trading profits if it enhances the precision of the institution's information relative to that of uninformed traders. Thus, the ability to speculate can increase or decrease institutional intervention. We examine key factors that affect the intervention decision, the usefulness of \u201cshort\u2010swing\u201d provisions and restricted shares in encouraging institutional intervention, and implications for ownership structure across different firms.",

Consistent with this hypothesis, firms that carve out subsidiaries exhibit poor operating performance and high leverage prior to carve\u2010outs. Also consistent with this hypothesis, in carve\u2010outs wherein funds raised are used to pay down debt, the average excess stock return of + 6.63 percent is significantly greater than the average excess stock return of \u22120.01 percent for carve\u2010outs wherein funds are retained for investment purposes.",

Return continuation is present in all twelve sample countries and lasts on average for about one year. Return continuation is negatively related to firm size, but is not limited to small firms. The international momentum returns are correlated with those of the United States which suggests that exposure to a common factor may drive the profitability of momentum strategies.",
