            "abstract": "We present evidence that reassigning tasks among agents can alleviate moral hazard in communication. A rotation policy that routinely reassigns loan officers to borrowers of a commercial bank affects the officers' reporting behavior. When an officer anticipates rotation, reports are more accurate and contain more bad news about the borrower's repayment prospects. As a result, the rotation policy makes bank lending decisions more sensitive to officer reports. The threat of rotation improves communication because self\u2010reporting bad news has a smaller negative effect on an officer's career prospects than bad news exposed by a successor.",

More densely networked markets experience less entry, with a one\u2010standard deviation increase in network ties among incumbents reducing entry by approximately one\u2010third. Entrants with established ties to target\u2010market incumbents appear able to overcome this barrier to entry; in turn, incumbents react strategically to an increased threat of entry by freezing out any incumbents who facilitate entry into their market. Incumbents appear to benefit from reduced entry by paying lower prices for their deals.",

These differences in states' branching restrictions affect credit supply. In states more open to branching, small firms borrow at interest rates 80 to 100 basis points lower than firms operating in less open states. Firms in open states also are more likely to borrow from banks. Despite this evidence that interstate branch openness expands credit supply, we find no effect of variation in state restrictions on branching on the amount that small firms borrow.",

Employees become entrenched under this contract and so face large human costs of bankruptcy. The firm's optimal capital structure therefore depends on the trade\u2010off between these human costs and the tax benefits of debt. Optimal debt levels consistent with those observed in practice emerge without relying on frictions such as moral hazard or asymmetric information. Consistent with empirical evidence, persistent idiosyncratic differences in leverage across firms also result. In addition, wages should have explanatory power for firm leverage.",

Whoever wins the bidding contest has the option (not the obligation) to accept this loan commitment. We show that stapled finance increases bidding competition by subsidizing weak bidders, who raise their bids and thereby the price that strong bidders (who are more likely to win) must pay. The lender expects not to break even and must be compensated for offering the loan. This reduces but does not eliminate the seller's benefit. It also implies that stapled finance loans will show poorer performance than other buyout loans.",

            "abstract": "This paper studies the relation between corporate liquidity and diversification. The key finding is that multidivision firms hold significantly less cash than stand\u2010alone firms because they are diversified in their investment opportunities. Lower cross\u2010divisional correlations in investment opportunity and higher correlations between investment opportunity and cash flow correspond to lower cash holdings, even after controlling for cash flow volatility. The effects are strongest in financially constrained firms and in well\u2010governed firms, and correspond to efficient fund transfers from low\u2010 to high\u2010productivity divisions. Taken together, these results bring forth an efficient link between diversification and corporate liquidity.",

            "abstract": "We argue that time variation in the maturity of corporate debt arises because firms behave as macro liquidity providers, absorbing the supply shocks associated with changes in the maturity structure of government debt. We document that when the government funds itself with more short\u2010term debt, firms fill the resulting gap by issuing more long\u2010term debt, and vice versa. This type of liquidity provision is undertaken more aggressively: (1) when the ratio of government debt to total debt is higher and (2) by firms with stronger balance sheets. Our theory sheds new light on market timing phenomena in corporate finance more generally.",

            "abstract": "Financial regulation was as hotly debated a political issue in the 19th century as it is today. We study the political economy of state usury laws in 19th century America. Exploiting the wide variation in regulation, enforcement, and economic conditions across states and time, we find that usury laws when binding reduce credit and economic activity, especially for smaller firms. We examine the motives of regulation and find that usury laws coincide with other economic and political policies favoring wealthy political incumbents, particularly when they have more voting power. The evidence suggests financial regulation is driven by private interests capturing rents from others rather than public interests protecting the underserved.",

            "abstract": "We identify different sources of risk as important determinants of banks' corporate structures when expanding into new markets. Subsidiary\u2010based corporate structures benefit from greater protection against economic risk because of affiliate\u2010level limited liability, but are more exposed to the risk of capital expropriation than are branches. Thus, branch\u2010based structures are preferred to subsidiary\u2010based structures when expropriation risk is high relative to economic risk, and vice versa. Greater cross\u2010country risk correlation and more accurate pricing of risk by investors reduce the differences between the two structures. Furthermore, a bank's corporate structure affects its risk taking and affiliate size.",

Using shifts in import tariffs to identify exogenous intensification of competition, difference\u2010in\u2010difference estimations support the causal impact of cash on product market performance. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the \u201ccompetitive\u201d effect of cash is markedly distinct from the strategic effect of debt on product market outcomes. This effect is stronger when rivals face tighter financing constraints and when the number of interactions between competitors is large. Overall, the results suggest that cash policy encompasses a substantial strategic dimension.",
