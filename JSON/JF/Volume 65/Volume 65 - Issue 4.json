            "abstract": "I describe asset price dynamics caused by the slow movement of investment capital to trading opportunities. The pattern of price responses to supply or demand shocks typically involves a sharp reaction to the shock and a subsequent and more extended reversal. The amplitude of the immediate price impact and the pattern of the subsequent recovery can reflect institutional impediments to immediate trade, such as search costs for trading counterparties or time to raise capital by intermediaries. I discuss special impediments to capital formation during the recent financial crisis that caused asset price distortions, which subsided afterward. After presenting examples of price reactions to supply shocks in normal market settings, I offer a simple illustrative model of price dynamics associated with slow\u2010moving capital due to the presence of inattentive investors.",

            "abstract": "The empirical evidence on investor disagreement and trading volume is difficult to reconcile in standard rational expectations models. We develop a dynamic model in which investors disagree about the interpretation of public information. We obtain a closed\u2010form linear equilibrium that allows us to study which restrictions on the disagreement process yield empirically observed volume and return dynamics. We show that when investors have infrequent but major disagreements, there is positive autocorrelation in volume and positive correlation between volume and volatility. We also derive novel empirical predictions that relate the degree and frequency of disagreement to volume and volatility dynamics.",

We show in an endowment economy that recursive utility with GDA risk preferences generates effective risk aversion that is countercyclical. This feature comes from endogenous variation in the probability of disappointment in the representative agent's intertemporal consumption\u2010saving problem that underlies the asset pricing model. The variation in effective risk aversion produces a large equity premium and a risk\u2010free rate that is procyclical and has low volatility in an economy with a simple autoregressive endowment\u2010growth process.",

            "abstract": "I study the asset pricing implications of the quality of public information about persistent productivity shocks in a general equilibrium model with Kreps\u2013Porteus preferences. Low information quality is associated with a high equity premium, a low volatility of consumption growth, and a low volatility of the risk\u2010free interest rate. The relationship between information quality and the equity premium differs from that in endowment economies. My calibration improves substantially upon the Bansal\u2013Yaron model in terms of the moments of the wealth\u2013consumption ratio and the return on aggregate wealth.",

We find a striking pattern of return continuation at half\u2010hour intervals that are exact multiples of a trading day, and this effect lasts for at least 40 trading days. Volume, order imbalance, volatility, and bid\u2010ask spreads exhibit similar patterns, but do not explain the return patterns. We also show that short\u2010term return reversal is driven by temporary liquidity imbalances lasting less than an hour and bid\u2010ask bounce. Timing trades can reduce execution costs by the equivalent of the effective spread.",

We find that returns and dividend growth rates are predictable with\nR\n2\nvalues ranging from 8.2% to 8.9% for returns and 13.9% to 31.6% for dividend growth rates. Both expected returns and expected dividend growth rates have a persistent component, but expected returns are more persistent than expected dividend growth rates.",

Using simulations and trading records of all individual investors in Finland, I find that these trading patterns can be explained in large part by investors' use of limit orders. These patterns arise mechanically because limit orders are price\u2010contingent and suffer from adverse selection. Reverse causality from behavioral biases to order choices does not appear to explain my findings. I propose a simple method for measuring a data set's susceptibility to this limit order effect.",

Foreign firms with more agency problems have worse stock\u2010price reactions to the adoption of Rule 12h\u20106 in 2007, which made deregistration easier, than those firms more adversely affected by the compliance costs of SOX. Stock\u2010price reactions to deregistration announcements are negative, but less so under Rule 12h\u20106, and more so for firms that raise fewer funds externally.",

Consistent with incubation being used by fund families to increase performance and attract flows, funds in incubation outperform nonincubated funds by 3.5% risk\u2010adjusted, and when they are opened to the public they attract higher flows. Postincubation, however, this outperformance disappears. This performance reversal imparts an upward bias to returns that is not removed by a fund size filter. Fund age and ticker creation date filters, however, eliminate the bias.",
