In this paper, the author develops and tests the hypothesis that underpricing serves as a form of insurance against legal liability and the associated damages to the reputations of investment bankers. The empirical results based on samples of IPOs that were brought to the market before and after the Securities Act of 1933 provide considerable support for the implicit insurance hypothesis. Specifically, gross underpricing and market segmentation between prestigious and fringe investment bankers in originating unseasoned new issues appear to be peculiar to the post\u20101933 era.",

The guaranty funds charge flat premium rates, usually a percentage of premiums. Flat premiums can induce insurers to adopt high\u2010risk strategies, a problem that can be avoided through the use of risk\u2010based premiums. This article develops risk\u2010based premium formulas for three cases: a) an ongoing insurer with stochastic assets and liabilities, b) an ongoing insurer also subject to jumps in liabilities (catastrophes), and c) a policy cohort, where claims eventually run off to zero. Premium estimates are provided and compared with actual guaranty fund assessment rates.",

This paper models the rounding mechanism and examines the probabilistic structure of the resultant rounded process. We provide accurate and simple estimates of the inflation in estimated variance and kurtosis induced by ignoring rounding. In particular, the maximum\u2010likelihood estimate of security price volatility using rounded prices is developed, and a simulation analysis is performed to examine the small\u2010sample properties of this estimator. For many practical applications, a simple correction for rounding becomes available.",

Using this representation and continuous trading, there exists a set of individuals who do not participate in the asset market and who consume at the rate of nonmarketable income derived from human capital. Because these individuals remain nonparticipants for a range of stochastic processes governing the NM income, consumption betas are not generally unique in value and the consumption\u2010based CAPM (CCAPM) does not obtain. However, the intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) of Merton remains valid.",

            "abstract": "This study shows that the competitive\u2010equilibrium version of the APT may be extended to develop an exact model if idiosyncratic risks obey the Ross separating distribution. The results indicate that one only need add the market portfolio as an extra factor to the factor model in order to obtain an exact asset\u2010pricing relation. Thus, this study presents an extension and integration of the CAPM and APT. The \u201cempirical\u201d APT is also generalized to allow for some factors to be omitted from the econometric model employed to test the theory. The developed model is extremely robust and may be reduced to the CAPM or expanded to approximate Ross's APT depending upon the number of omitted factors. Further, the importance of the market portfolio is shown to be a monotonic increasing function of the number of omitted factors. Finally, the study demonstrates that, in a finite economy, the pricing\u2010error bound of the Ross APT in a correlated\u2010residuals factor structure is an increasing function of the absolute value of market\u2010residual beta, rather than the weight of the asset in the market portfolio as is the case of uncorrelated factor residuals. However, under the normality assumption, the pricing error becomes an extra component related to the market\u2010portfolio factor, and the exact asset\u2010pricing relation is once again obtained.",

Its properties are derived from a certain no\u2010arbitrage condition via duality theory in convex programming. Transactions costs imply an infinite multiplicity of term structures. A simple example with realistic transactions costs shows that this multiplicity can induce a valuation range of over 277 basis points. Transactions costs also allow equilibrium without short sale restrictions. The authors find the minimum transactions costs that prevent arbitrage. In addition, the exact conditions for weak clientele, in which investors will not buy some bonds and may not sell any that they already hold, are established.",

The authors develop the idea of forward tax rates and compute forward tax rates for 1955 through 1984.

We consider both in\u2010sample and out\u2010of\u2010sample tests. One hypothesis that is consistent with our findings is that real disturbances (such as productivity shocks) may be a major source of exchange rate volatility.",

Second, a different specification is used to obtain more efficient estimates. Third, additional nominal contracts are considered.

Contrary to some recent studies, however, we find a positive stock price reaction to debt offerings, while the negative equity\u2010issuance effect is preserved. Further empirical evidence lends support to signalling as the explanation for the positive significant debt\u2010issuance effect.",
