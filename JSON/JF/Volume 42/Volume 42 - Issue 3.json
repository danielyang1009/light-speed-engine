We compare the behavior of open\u2010to\u2010open and close\u2010to\u2010close returns on NYSE stocks, given the differences in execution methods applied in the opening and closing transactions. Opening returns are found to exhibit greater dispersion, greater deviations from normality and a more negative and significant autocorrelation pattern than closing returns. We study the effects of the bid\u2010ask spread and the price\u2010adjustment process on the estimated return variances and covariances and discuss the associated biases. We conclude that the trading mechanism has a significant effect on stock price behavior.",

The seasonal pattern of returns is also examined. Excess returns in January are related to both short\u2010term and long\u2010term past performance, as well as to the previous year market return.",

It also develops inference procedures for zero and unit net investment portfolios of individual securities (instead of grouped portfolios) that have zero expected betas.

An agency problem, a signalling problem and an agency\u2010signalling problem arise as special cases. The associated informational equilibria and the optimal financing arrangements are characterized and compared. In the agency\u2010signalling equilibrium the private information of corporate insiders at the time of financing is signalled through capital structure choices which deviate optimally from agency\u2010cost minimizing financing arrangements, which in turn induce risk\u2010shifting incentives in the investment policy. In the pure signalling case the equilibrium is characterized by direct contractual precommitments to implement investment policies which are riskier than pareto\u2010optimal levels. Empirical implications for debt covenants and the announcement effect of investment policies and leverage increasing transactions on existing stock and bond prices are explicitly derived.",

The corporate credit granting process has not received as much attention in the literature. This paper examines the relative effectiveness of parametric, nonparametric and judgemental classification procedures on a sample of corporate credit data. The judgemental model is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Evidence indicates that (nonparametric) recursive partitioning methods provide greater information than simultaneous partitioning procedures. The judgemental model is found to perform as well as statistical models. A complementary relationship is proposed between the statistical and the judgemental models as an effective paradigm for granting credit.",

An equilibrium derived from a rational flower bond pricing model implies the existence of clienteles: individuals with the highest death probabilities hold the deepest discount flower bonds. The empirical implication, that bonds with the deepest discount should be redeemed at the fastest rate, is tested and the results support the proposition.",

This result is shown to arise partly from failure to correct for a selectivity bias in the choice of issuance procedures. Two stage analysis is used in a model that includes qualitative and limited dependent variables to re\u2010estimate the net interest cost difference between competitive and negotiated issues. Results support the hypothesis that the choice of issuance procedure is consistent with shareholder wealth maximization. Examination of debt issues subject to Rule 50 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act indicates that the regulation, as applied, is not effective.",

In this paper, these variables are observed in a controlled setting\u2014a computerized double auction market, similar to NASDAQ. Our laboratory allows experimental control of information arrival\u2014whether simultaneously or sequentially received, and whether homogeneous or heterogeneous. We compare the price, volume, and share allocations of three market equilibrium models: telepathic rational expectations, which assumes that traders can read each others minds (strong\u2010form market efficiency); ordinary rational expectations, which assumes traders can use (some) market price information, (a type of semi\u2010strong form efficiency); and private information, where traders use no market information. We conclude 1) that stronger\u2010form market models predict equilibrium prices better than weaker\u2010form models, 2) that there were fewer misallocation forecasts in simultaneous information arrival (SIM) environments, 3) that trading volume was significantly higher in SIM environments, 4) and that bid\u2010ask spreads widen significantly when traders are exposed to price uncertainty resulting from information heterogeneity.",
