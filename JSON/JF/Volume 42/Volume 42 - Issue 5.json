The resulting model uses the bond price as the single state variable and thus preserves much of the simplicity and robustness of the Black\u2010Scholes approach. The paper provides comparisons between option prices computed using this model and those using the Black\u2010Scholes and Brennan and Schwartz models.",

In the context of the Black\u2010Scholes economy, margin restrictions are shown to exclude continuous\u2010trading arbitrage opportunities and, with two additional hypotheses, still to allow the Black\u2010Scholes call model to apply. The Black\u2010Scholes economy consists of a continuously traded stock with a price process that follows a geometric Brownian motion and a continuously traded bond with a price process that is deterministic.",

Although there are separation theorems in the stock and forward markets literatures, this analysis shows that neither separation theorem survives in this integrated financial market economy. Next, the analysis shows that the separation results hold and are equivalent if the manager has an appropriate compensation package. Then the model is modified to allow for depreciation charges and tax credits. A positive theory of hedging is developed that shows that the corporation can preserve deductions and credits by hedging and so increase corporate value.",

The results show that there is a January effect and a small\u2010firm effect in stock returns. Correlation matrices are more stable than covariance matrices, but both types of matrices are not stable across months and across the sample groups. The number of return\u2010generating factors is rather stable most of the time and for most of the sample groups, but there is some significant instability that is related to the average correlation coefficients among stocks. The APT pricing relationship does not seem to be supported by the two\u2010stage process using the maximum\u2010likelihood factor analysis.",

The most important implication of the findings in this paper is that the APT model can explain the risk\u2010return relation mostly for January. Once the January returns are excluded from the data, there is no significant relation between the expected stock returns and the risk measures predicted by the APT model.",

Thus, using spread data to adjust for biases in return moments requires knowing not only the spread but the composition of the spread. Furthermore, any spread\u2010estimation procedure using transaction prices must estimate two spread components. On the other hand, the appropriateness of some previously suggested statistical corrections is independent of the spread composition.",

The market recognizes that, subsequent to the (reverse) split ex\u2010day, the daily number of transactions along with the raw volume of shares traded will increase (decrease). This increase in volume results in an increase in the noisiness of the security's return process. The increase in noise raises the tax\u2010option value of the stock, and it is this value that generates the announcement effect of stock splits. Empirical evidence using security returns, daily trading volume, and shareholder data strongly supports this theory. The evidence, in conjunction with this theory, also agrees with extant literature that splits result in decreased liquidity, but there is no evidence that this reduction in liquidity is priced.",
