These tests exploit the relation between expected excess returns and current market values. Using weekly data for 1963 through 1982 on ten common stock portfolios formed according to equity capitalization, a single\u2010risk\u2010premium model is not rejected if the expected premium is time varying and is not constrained to correspond to a market factor. Conditional mean\u2010variance efficiency of a value\u2010weighted stock index is rejected, and the rejection is insensitive to how much variability of expected risk premiums is assumed.",

An alternative estimator, based on a model of the price\u2010adjustment delay process, reveals roughly twice as much covariation in individual security returns. The number of factors identified also appears to increase when this estimator is employed. Since the linear space spanned by the estimated factor\u2010loading vectors is quite sensitive to the estimator used, it is important that the consistent estimator be considered in the usual two\u2010stage empirical investigations of the APT.",

They employ the standard CAPM benchmarks and a variety of APT benchmarks to investigate this question. They find little similarity between the absolute and relative mutual fund rankings obtained from these alternative benchmarks, which suggests the importance of knowing the appropriate model for risk and return in this context. In addition, the rankings are not insensitive to the method used to construct the APT benchmark. Finally, they find statistically significant measured abnormal performance using all the benchmarks. The economic explanation for this phenomenon appears to be an open question.",

Because corporate insiders can exploit multiple signals, the efficient mix must minimize dissipative costs. In equilibrium, many firms both distribute dividends and deviate from first\u2010best investment. Also, the impact of dividends on stock prices is positive. By contrast, the announcement effect of new stock is negative for firms with private information primarily about assets in place and positive for firms with inside information mainly about opportunities to invest.",

Both moral hazard and adverse selection are considered. The principal message is that how a competitive equilibrium is conceptualized significantly affects the characterization of equilibrium credit contracts. Specifically, some well\u2010known results in the rationing literature are shown to rest delicately on the adopted equilibrium concept. Two somewhat surprising results emerge. First, high\u2010quality borrowers with unlimited collateral may be priced out of the market despite the bank having idle deposits. Second, high\u2010quality borrowers may put up more collateral.",

Diagnostic tests indicate that these methods are quite successful in capturing the essence of the time\u2010series properties of premium terms. The estimated premium models indicate that premia show a certain degree of persistance over time and that more than half the variance in the forecast error that results from the use of current forward rates as predictors of future spot rates is accounted for by variation in premium terms. The methodology can be applied straightforwardly to the measurement of unobservables in other financial markets.",

The analysis is based on the response of the term structure of interest rates to the weekly Federal Reserve announcements of bank reserves during the post\u2010October 1979 period. It is shown that unanticipated changes in the mix between borrowed and nonborrowed reserves cause expected real interest rates to change after the announcement because they provide information about a future change in the supply of money. A precise model is developed and tested during subperiods of nonborrowed and borrowed reserves targeting by the Fed.",

Most studies of financial institutions have failed to take into account the multiproduct nature of these institutions.

A translogarithmic cost function is estimated using 1982 data on California savings and loans. Restrictive functional forms also estimated are rejected. Standard errors for the statistics calculated are estimated, and various statistical tests are conducted. Previous authors have not calculated standard errors for these statistics. No evidence of subadditivity in the industry is found.",
