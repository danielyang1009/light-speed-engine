            "abstract": "Algorithmic trading (AT) has increased sharply over the past decade. Does it improve market quality, and should it be encouraged? We provide the first analysis of this question. The New York Stock Exchange automated quote dissemination in 2003, and we use this change in market structure that increases AT as an exogenous instrument to measure the causal effect of AT on liquidity. For large stocks in particular, AT narrows spreads, reduces adverse selection, and reduces trade\u2010related price discovery. The findings indicate that AT improves liquidity and enhances the informativeness of quotes.",

In a large sample of 10\u2010Ks during 1994 to 2008, almost three\u2010fourths of the words identified as negative by the widely used Harvard Dictionary are words typically not considered negative in financial contexts. We develop an alternative negative word list, along with five other word lists, that better reflect tone in financial text. We link the word lists to 10\u2010K filing returns, trading volume, return volatility, fraud, material weakness, and unexpected earnings.",

            "abstract": "Disentangling the causal impact of media reporting from the impact of the events being reported is challenging. We solve this problem by comparing the behaviors of investors with access to different media coverage of the same information event. We use zip codes to identify 19 mutually exclusive trading regions corresponding with large U.S. cities. For all earnings announcements of S&P 500 Index firms, we find that local media coverage strongly predicts local trading, after controlling for earnings, investor, and newspaper characteristics. Moreover, local trading is strongly related to the timing of local reporting, a particular challenge to nonmedia explanations.",

Constrained firms de\u2010lever by selling assets to lower\u2010leverage firms. In turn, asset\u2013market liquidity depends on the system\u2010wide distribution of leverage, which is itself endogenous to future economic prospects. Good economic prospects yield cheaper short\u2010term debt, inducing entry of higher\u2010leverage firms. Consequently, adverse asset shocks in good times lead to greater de\u2010leveraging and sudden drying up of market and funding liquidity.",

We show that such effects are not new; in fact, we find a strong relation between stock market liquidity and the business cycle. We also show that investors' portfolio compositions change with the business cycle and that investor participation is related to market liquidity. This suggests that systematic liquidity variation is related to a \u201cflight to quality\u201d during economic downturns. Overall, our results provide a new explanation for the observed commonality in liquidity.",

We show that illiquid assets can have lower expected returns if the short\u2010sellers have more wealth, lower risk aversion, or shorter horizon. The pricing of liquidity risk is different for derivatives than for positive\u2010net\u2010supply assets, and depends on investors' net nontraded risk exposure. We estimate this model for the credit default swap market. We find strong evidence for an expected liquidity premium earned by the credit protection seller. The effect of liquidity risk is significant but economically small.",

The results show that profitable firms and firms with a lower wage bill are likely to be privatized early. We find that the government delays privatization in regions where the governing party faces more competition from opposition parties. The results also suggest that political patronage is important as no firm located in the home state of the minister in charge is ever privatized. Using political variables as an instrument for the privatization decision, we find that privatization has a positive impact on firm performance.",

We find substantial advisory compensation rate changes in both directions, with typical percentage fee shifts exceeding one\u2010fourth. Rate increases are associated with superior past market\u2010adjusted performance, whereas rate decreases reflect economies of scale associated with growth, and are not associated with extreme poor performance. There are within\u2010family spillover effects. Superior (e.g., star) performance for individual funds is associated with rate increases for a family's other funds. Rate reductions post\u20102004 by family funds involved in market timing scandals do not have large industry spillover effects.",

S&P/Barra follow a simple mechanical procedure to define their Value and Growth indices. In doing so, they reclassify some stocks from Value to Growth even after their book\u2010to\u2010market ratios have risen, and vice versa. Such stocks begin to covary more with the index they join and less with the index they leave. Backdated constituent data from Barra reveal no such label\u2010related shifts in comovement during the 10 years prior to the actual introduction of the indices in 1992.",
