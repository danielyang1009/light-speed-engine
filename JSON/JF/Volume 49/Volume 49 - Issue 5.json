            "abstract": "For many years, scholars and investment professionals have argued that value strategies outperform the market. These value strategies call for buying stocks that have low prices relative to earnings, dividends, book assets, or other measures of fundamental value. While there is some agreement that value strategies produce higher returns, the interpretation of why they do so is more controversial. This article provides evidence that value strategies yield higher returns because these strategies exploit the suboptimal behavior of the typical investor and not because these strategies are fundamentally riskier.",

Stock returns of noncyclical industries tend to covary positively with expected inflation, while the reverse holds for cyclical industries. From a theoretical perspective, we describe a model that captures both (i) the cross\u2010sectional variation in these relations across industries, and (ii) the negative and positive relation between stock returns and inflation at short and long horizons, respectively. The model is developed in an economic environment in which the spirit of the Fisher model is preserved.",

In addition, the model is consistent with empirical correlations that are suggestive of oft\u2010cited trading strategies such as profit taking (short\u2010term position reversal) and following the leader (mimicking earlier trades).",

Despite the direct costs of the tax, its announcement produced a positive revaluation of corporate equity, particularly among lower\u2010payout firms. We interpret this as evidence of a divergence between managerial and shareholder preferences regarding dividend payout policies, consistent with the presence of agency costs. We also find that despite the incentives created by the tax, the actual growth in dividends during 1936 was lower among firms judged more likely to be subject to higher agency costs after controlling for liquidity, debt, and the growth in earnings.",

Moreover, changes in ordinary least squares beta estimates are significantly related to contemporaneous changes in trading activity. Our results have implications for studies interested in the properties of security returns, particularly those examining periods in which trading activity changes.",

The lack of odd\u2010eighth quotes cannot be explained by the negotiation hypothesis of Harris (1991), trading activity, or other variables thought to impact spreads. This result implies that the inside spread for a large number of NASDAQ stocks is at least $0.25 and raises the question of whether NASDAQ dealers implicitly collude to maintain wide spreads.",

On May 27, dealers in Amgen, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft sharply increased their use of odd\u2010eighth quotes, and mean inside and effective spreads fell nearly 50 percent.

Any explanation of this phenomenon that is consistent with rational pricing must specify a source of seasonality in expected returns.

This model accounts for the seasonality in average returns, while the capital asset pricing model cannot.",
