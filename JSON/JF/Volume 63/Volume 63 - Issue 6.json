            "abstract": "We study the effect that a general lack of trust can have on stock market participation. In deciding whether to buy stocks, investors factor in the risk of being cheated. The perception of this risk is a function of the objective characteristics of the stocks and the subjective characteristics of the investor. Less trusting individuals are less likely to buy stock and, conditional on buying stock, they will buy less. In Dutch and Italian micro data, as well as in cross\u2010country data, we find evidence consistent with lack of trust being an important factor in explaining the limited participation puzzle.",

Stock market conditions while MBA students are in school have a large effect on whether they go directly to Wall Street upon graduation. Further, starting on Wall Street immediately upon graduation causes a person to be more likely to work there later and to earn, on average, substantially more money. The empirical results suggest that investment bankers are largely \u201cmade\u201d by circumstance rather than \u201cborn\u201d to work on Wall Street.",

Our results show that, contrary to anecdotal evidence, a significant portion of directors hold shares in the funds they oversee. Ownership patterns are broadly consistent with an optimal contracting equilibrium. That is, ownership is positively and significantly correlated with most variables that are predicted to indicate greater value from directors' monitoring. For example, directors' ownership is more prevalent in actively managed funds and in funds with lower institutional ownership. We also show considerable heterogeneity in ownership across fund families, suggesting family\u2010wide policies play an important role.",

Our setting allows us to trace this effect to the returns personally experienced by investors; the effect is not explained by patterns related to the IPO cycle, or wealth effects. This behavior is consistent with reinforcement learning, where personally experienced outcomes are overweighted compared to rational Bayesian learning. The results provide a microfoundation for the argument that investor sentiment drives IPO demand. The paper also contributes to understanding how popular investment styles develop, and has implications for the marketing of financial products.",

ICMs provide ex post resource flexibility, but come with ex ante commitment costs. Alternatively, stand\u2010alones possess commitment ability but lack flexibility. By creating flexibility, integration can sometimes deter a rival's entry, but commitment problems can also invite predatory capital raising. These forces drive different organizational equilibria depending on the integrator's relation to the product market. Hybrid organizational forms like strategic alliances can sometimes dominate integration by offering some of its benefits with fewer strategic costs.",

Moreover, a risk\u2010averse CEO's overconfidence enhances firm value up to a point, but the effect is nonmonotonic and differs from that of lower risk aversion. Overconfident CEOs also underinvest in information production. The board fires both excessively diffident and excessively overconfident CEOs.

We examine the value of disclosure through the controversial SEC requirement, since overturned, which required major hedge funds to register as investment advisors and file Form ADV disclosures. Leverage and ownership structures suggest that lenders and equity investors were already aware of operational risk. However, operational risk does not mediate flow\u2010performance relationships. Investors either lack this information or regard it as immaterial. These findings suggest that regulators should account for the endogenous production of information and the marginal benefit of disclosure to different investment clienteles.",

Moreover, the targets of these acquirers realize higher announcement returns and better post\u2010acquisition operating performance than do targets of other types of acquirers, particularly when they face greater information asymmetries.",

First, we show theoretically that ICC is perfectly correlated with the conditional expected stock return under plausible conditions. Second, our simulations show that ICC is helpful in detecting an intertemporal risk\u2013return relation, even when earnings forecasts are poor. Finally, in empirical analysis, we construct the time series of ICC for the G\u20137 countries. We find a positive relation between the conditional mean and variance of stock returns, at both the country level and the world market level.",

Since 1981, financially distressed stocks have delivered anomalously low returns. They have lower returns but much higher standard deviations, market betas, and loadings on value and small\u2010cap risk factors than stocks with low failure risk. These patterns are more pronounced for stocks with possible informational or arbitrage\u2010related frictions. They are inconsistent with the conjecture that the value and size effects are compensation for the risk of financial distress.",

Although asset growth has little effect on the behavior of the typical fund, we find that large funds and small\u2010cap funds diversify their portfolios in response to growth. Greater diversification, especially for small\u2010cap funds, is associated with better performance. Fund family growth is related to the introduction of new funds that hold different stocks from their existing siblings. Funds with many siblings diversify less rapidly as they grow, suggesting that the fund family may influence a fund's portfolio strategy.",

The short\u2010run component captures market skewness risk, which we interpret as a measure of the tightness of financial constraints. The long\u2010run component relates to business cycle risk. Furthermore, a three\u2010factor pricing model with the market return and the two volatility components compares favorably to benchmark models.",

Our results indicate that specialists allocate effort toward their most active stocks during periods of increased activity, resulting in less frequent price improvement and increased transaction costs for their remaining assigned stocks. Thus, the allocation of effort due to limited attention has a significant impact on liquidity provision in securities markets.",
