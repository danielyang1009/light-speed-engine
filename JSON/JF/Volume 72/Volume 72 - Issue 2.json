            "abstract": "This paper uses a randomized field experiment to identify which start\u2010up characteristics are most important to investors in early\u2010stage firms. The experiment randomizes investors\u2019 information sets of fund\u2010raising start\u2010ups. The average investor responds strongly to information about the founding team, but not to firm traction or existing lead investors. We provide evidence that the team is not merely a signal of quality, and that investing based on team information is a rational strategy. Together, our results indicate that information about human assets is causally important for the funding of early\u2010stage firms and hence for entrepreneurial success.",

We find evidence of higher job creation, on average, at the establishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity firms than at those operated by targets of nonconnected private equity firms. Consistent with an exchange of favors story, establishments operated by targets of politically connected private equity firms increase employment more during election years and in states with high levels of corruption. In additional analyses, we provide evidence of specific benefits experienced by target firms from their political connections. Our results are robust to tests designed to mitigate selection concerns.",

            "abstract": "Homeowners at risk of default face a debt overhang that reduces their incentive to invest in their property: in expectation, some value created by investments in the property will go to the lender. This agency conflict affects housing investments. Homeowners at risk of default cut back substantially on home improvements and mortgage principal payments, even when they appear financially unconstrained. Meanwhile, they do not reduce spending on assets that they may retain in default, including home appliances, furniture, and vehicles. These findings highlight an important financial friction that has stifled housing investment since the Great Recession.",

We use confidential data on banks\u2019 internal ratings on loans to businesses over the period 1997 to 2011 from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending. We find that ex ante risk\u2010taking by banks (measured by the risk rating of new loans) is negatively associated with increases in short\u2010term interest rates. This relationship is more pronounced in regions that are less in sync with the nationwide business cycle, and less pronounced for banks with relatively low capital or during periods of financial distress.",

A parsimonious model specification within the linear\u2010rational class has a very good fit to both interest rate swaps and swaptions since 1997 and captures many features of term structure, volatility, and risk premium dynamics\u2014including when interest rates are close to the zero lower bound.",

When structurally estimating an extended life\u2010cycle model, the parameter combination that best fits the data is one with a relatively large risk aversion, a small per\u2010period participation cost, and a yearly probability of a large stock market loss in line with the frequency of stock market crashes in Norway.",

Plausibly exogenous losses of analysts with related industry experience have real financial market implications\u2014changes in firms\u2019 information asymmetry and price reactions are significantly larger than those of other analysts.

Risky assets represent 40% of firms\u2019 financial portfolios, or 6% of total book assets. We present a formal model to assess the optimality of this behavior. Consistent with the model, risky assets are concentrated in financially unconstrained firms holding large financial portfolios, are held by poorly governed firms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets. We conclude that this activity represents an unregulated asset management industry of more than $1.5 trillion, questioning the traditional boundaries of nonfinancial firms.",

The average welfare gain from RMLs is $252 per homeowner, and $1,770 per RML borrower. Bequest motives, uncertainty about health and expenses, and loan costs account for low demand. According to the model, the Great Recession's impact differs across age, income, and wealth distributions, with a threefold increase in RML demand for lowest income and oldest households.",
