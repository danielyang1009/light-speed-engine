We show that, over the life cycle, households progressively shift from growth to value as they become older and their balance sheets improve. Furthermore, investors with high human capital and high exposure to macroeconomic risk tilt their portfolios away from value. While several behavioral biases seem evident in the data, the patterns we uncover are overall remarkably consistent with the portfolio implications of risk\u2010based theories of the value premium.",

I apply a simple model of the filtering process that allows one to undo the filtering inherent in NIPA consumption. \u201cUnfiltered NIPA consumption\u201d well explains the equity premium and is priced in the cross\u2010section of stock returns. I discuss the likely properties of true consumption (i.e., without measurement error and filtering) and quantify implications for habit and long\u2010run risk models.",

We control for local demand shocks by comparing treated homeowners to controls in the same region that do not experience collateral shocks: renters and homeowners with an outstanding mortgage, who (in France) cannot take out a second mortgage. In both comparisons, an increase in collateral value leads to a higher probability of becoming an entrepreneur. Conditional on entry, treated entrepreneurs use more debt, start larger firms, and remain larger in the long run.",

Plausibly exogenous variation in workers\u2019 exposure to a depression allows us to identify the effects and a new estimation approach makes addressing wealth and income effects possible. We find that adversely affected workers are less likely to invest in risky assets. This result is robust to a number of control variables and it holds for individuals whose income, employment, and wealth were unaffected. The effects travel through social networks: individuals whose neighbors and family members experienced adverse circumstances also avoid risky investments.",

CEOs who experience fatal disasters without extremely negative consequences lead firms that behave more aggressively, whereas CEOs who witness the extreme downside of disasters behave more conservatively.

Ultimately, the link between CEOs\u2019 disaster experience and corporate policies has real economic consequences on firm riskiness and cost of capital.",

Using the formation of World War II Japanese internment camps to isolate exogenous shocks to local ethnic populations, we identify a causal link between local networks and firm trade. Firms are also more likely to acquire target firms, and report increased segment sales, in connected countries. Our results point to a surprisingly large role of immigrants as economic conduits for firms.",

Specifically, we find that firms reduce their investment and reliance on credit markets due to a rising cost of debt capital following a sovereign rating downgrade. We identify these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in corporate ratings due to rating agencies' sovereign ceiling policies, which require that firms' ratings remain at or below the sovereign rating of their country of domicile.",

We exploit a regulation that restricted the maturity of the trade credit contracts that a large retailer could sign with some of its small suppliers. Using a within\u2010product difference\u2010in\u2010differences identification strategy, we find that the restriction reduces the likelihood of trade by 11%. The retailer also responds by internalizing procurement to its own subsidiaries and reducing overall purchases. Finally, we find that relational contracts can mitigate the inability to extend long trade credit terms.",

We document that the equity risk premium is the primary determinant of buyout activity rather than credit\u2010specific conditions. We articulate a simple explanation for this phenomenon: a low risk premium increases the present value of performance gains and decreases the cost of holding an illiquid investment. A panel of U.S. buyouts confirms this view. The risk premium shapes changes in buyout characteristics over the cycle, including their riskiness, leverage, and performance. Our results underscore the importance of the risk premium in corporate finance decisions.",

We construct a parsimonious model where heterogeneous households have recursive preferences. A single state variable drives the conditional cross\u2010sectional moments of household consumption growth. The estimated model fits well the unconditional cross\u2010sectional moments of household consumption growth and the moments of the risk\u2010free rate, equity premium, price\u2010dividend ratio, and aggregate dividend and consumption growth. The model\u2010implied risk\u2010free rate and price\u2010dividend ratio are procyclical, while the market return has countercyclical mean and variance. Finally, household consumption risk explains the cross section of excess returns.",

We find more procyclical factor prices such as wages and real estate prices in areas with more cyclical economies, namely, high \u201clocal beta\u201d areas. While procyclical wages provide a natural hedge against aggregate shocks and reduce firm risk, procyclical prices of real estate, which are part of firm assets, increase firm risk. We confirm that firms located in higher local beta areas have lower industry\u2010adjusted returns and conditional betas, and show that the effect is stronger among firms with low real estate holdings.

Dividend capture trades represent 6% of all institutional buy trades but contribute 15% of overall abnormal returns. Institutional dividend capture trading is persistent. Institutional ex\u2010day profitability is also strongly cross\u2010sectionally related to trade execution skill. The relation between execution skill and profits disappears around placebo non\u2010ex\u2010days.
