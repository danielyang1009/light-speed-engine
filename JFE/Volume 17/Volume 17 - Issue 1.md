## 4. Stock return variances
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Kenneth R. French
- Richard Roll
### Abstract
Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.

## 5. Modeling the term structure of interest rates under non-separable utility and durability of goods
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Kenneth B. Dunn
- Kenneth J. Singleton
### Abstract
The term structure relations implied by a model in which preferences are non-separable functions of the service flows from two goods are investigated. The parameters characterizing preferences are estimated and restrictions on the co-movements of consumptions and Treasury bill returns are examined. Both the durability of goods and the non-separability of preferences are important factors in explaining the time paths of individual returns, but there is substantial evidence against the cross-sectional restrictions implied by our model. Differences between sample mean returns are too large relative to the sample covariances of the return differences and the marginal utility of consumption.

## 6. The effect of bond rating changes on common stock prices
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Robert W. Holthausen
- Richard W. Leftwich
### Abstract
The evidence in this paper suggests that downgrades by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's are associated with negative abnormal stock returns in the two-day window beginning the day of the press release by the rating agency. Significant negative abnormal performance can still be detected after eliminating observations containing obvious concurrent (potentially contaminating) news releases. There is little evidence of abnormal performance on announcement of an upgrade. Significant abnormal returns are associated with announcements of additions to the Standard and Poor's Credit Watch List, if either a potential downgrade or a potential upgrade is indicated.

## 7. The valuation of American call options and the expected ex-dividend stock price decline
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Giovanni Barone-Adesi
- Robert E. Whaley
### Abstract
This study focuses on the ex-dividend stock price decline implicit within the valuation of American call options on dividend-paying stocks. The Roll (1977) American call option pricing formula and the observed structure of CBOE call option transaction prices are used to infer the expected ex-dividend stock price decline as a proportion of the amount of the dividend. The relative decline is shown to be not meaningfully different from one, confirming some recent evidence from studies which examined stock prices in the days surrounding ex-dividend.

## 8. Event study methodologies and the size effect
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Elroy Dimson
- Paul Marsh
### Abstract
This study of 862 press recommendations demonstrates that the size effect can distort longer-term performance measures, and hence event studies. Relative to similar sized companies, post-publication performance is neutral. However, market adjustments, the CAPM and Market Model, with equally or capitalization weighted indexes, all produce biased results. Event studies are most exposed to such bias when the measurement interval is long, event securities differ systematically in size or weighting from the index constituents, the size effect is large and/or volatile, and when CAPM-type methodologies are used. These distortions are avoided by explicitly controlling for size.

## 9. Statistical tests of contingent-claims asset-pricing models
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Andrew W. Lo
### Abstract
A new methodology for statistically testing contingent-claims asset-pricing models based on asymptotic statistical theory is proposed. It is introduced in the context of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, for which some illustrative estimation, inference, and simulation results are also presented. The proposed methodology is then extended to arbitrary contingent claims by first considering the estimation problem for general Itô processes and then deriving the asymptotic distribution of a general contingent claim which depends upon such Itô processes.

## 10. Term premiums and default premiums in money markets
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Eugene F. Fama
### Abstract
There are time-varying term and default premiums in the expected returns on money market securities. Default premiums decline with maturity and tend to be higher during recessions. Term premiums tend to increase with maturity during good times, but humps and inversions in the term structure of expected returns are common during recessions. Treasury bills produce positive average term premiums for the overall sample, but average term premiums for private-issuer securities are close to 0.0. A general conclusion is that variation in forward rates is primarily variation in current epected returns rather than in forecasts of changes in interest rates.

## 11. Day-of-the-week and intraday effects in stock returns
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- Michael Smirlock
- Laura Starks
### Abstract
This study examines day-of-the-week effects using hourly values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that over the 1963–1983 period the weekend effect has sifted from characterizing active trading on Monday to characterizing the non-trading weekend. Over the early part of our sample period negative returns characterize each hour of trading on Monday, while the return from Friday close to Monday open is positive. In the most recent subperiod, Monday average hourly returns after noon are all positive and the weekend effect is due to negative average returns from Friday close to Monday open.

## 12. The equity premium and the concentration of aggregate shocks
### Date
- Sep 1986
### Author
- N.Gregory Mankiw
### Abstract
This paper examines an economy in which aggregate shocks are not dispersed equally throughout the population. Instead, while these shocks affect all individuals ex ante, they are concentrated among a few ex post. The equity premium in general depends on the concentration of these aggregate shocks; it follows that one cannot estimate the degree of risk aversion from aggregate data alone. These findings suggest that the empirical usefulness of aggregation theorems for capital asset pricing models is limited.
