## 2. Are lemons sold first? Dynamic signaling in the mortgage market

### Abstract
A central result in the theory of adverse selection in asset markets is that informed sellers can signal quality and obtain higher prices by delaying trade. This paper provides some of the first evidence of a signaling mechanism through trade delays using the residential mortgage market as a laboratory. We find a strong relationship between mortgage performance and time to sale for privately securitized mortgages. Additionally, deals made up of more seasoned mortgages are sold at lower yields. These effects are strongest in the “Alt-A” segment of the market, where mortgages are often sold with incomplete hard information, and in cases where the originator and the issuer of mortgage-backed securities are not affiliated.

## 3. Indexing and stock market serial dependence around the world

### Abstract
We show a striking change in index return serial dependence across 20 major market indexes covering 15 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. While many studies find serial dependence to be positive until the 1990s, it switches to negative since the 2000s. This change happens in most stock markets around the world and is both statistically significant and economically meaningful. Further tests reveal that the decline in serial dependence links to the increasing popularity of index products (e.g., futures, exchange-traded funds, and index mutual funds). The link between serial dependence and indexing is not driven by a time trend, holds up in the cross section of stock indexes, is confirmed by tests exploiting Nikkei 225 index weights and Standard & Poor’s 500 membership, and in part reflects the arbitrage mechanism between index products and the underlying stocks.

## 4. Industry familiarity and trading: Evidence from the personal portfolios of industry insiders

### Abstract
We study whether industry familiarity is an advantage in stock trading by exploring the trading patterns of industry insiders in their own personal portfolios. To do so, we identify accounts of industry insiders in a large data set provided by a retail discount broker. We find that insiders trade firms from their own industry more frequently. Furthermore, they earn abnormal returns exclusively when trading own-industry stocks, especially obscure stocks (small, low analyst coverage, high volatility). In a battery of tests, we find no evidence of the use of private information. The results are most consistent with the interpretation that industry familiarity is an advantage in stock trading.

## 5. Dynamic corporate liquidity

### Abstract
In contrast to cash holdings, credit lines give firms financial flexibility by providing liquidity contingent on realized funding needs, but they are often limited by collateral and covenants. We embed this trade-off into an estimated dynamic model of financing and investment. Our model highlights the relevance of drawing down credit lines to fund investment options in an effective way and quantitatively matches well the levels and dynamics of cash, credit lines, and leverage. In the cross-section, modeling credit lines as contingent liquidity provides novel empirical predictions and rationalizes several stylized facts regarding credit line usage, covenant violations, and cash holdings.

## 6. Preference for dividends and return comovement
### Date
- Sep 2018
### Authors
- Allaudeen Hameed
- Jing Xie
### Abstract
Stocks that initiate dividends tend to comove more with other dividend-paying stocks and comove less with non-dividend payers. This is also true for: (a) dividend initiations that are motivated by the exogenous 2003 dividend tax cut; and (b) the cash dividend share class of Citizens Utilities (relative to its stock dividend class). We find that flows to dividend prone (averse) mutual funds increase the comovement among dividend-paying (non-dividend paying) stocks. Overall, the evidence supports the proposition that the trading of pro-dividend (dividend-averse) clienteles induces an extra factor in dividend payers (non-payers), beyond those associated with changes in common factors.

## 7. Manager sentiment and stock returns

### Abstract
This paper constructs a manager sentiment index based on the aggregated textual tone of corporate financial disclosures. We find that manager sentiment is a strong negative predictor of future aggregate stock market returns, with monthly in-sample and out-of-sample R2s of 9.75% and 8.38%, respectively, which is far greater than the predictive power of other previously studied macroeconomic variables. Its predictive power is economically comparable and is informationally complementary to existing measures of investor sentiment. Higher manager sentiment precedes lower aggregate earnings surprises and greater aggregate investment growth. Moreover, manager sentiment negatively predicts cross-sectional stock returns, particularly for firms that are difficult to value and costly to arbitrage.

## 8. Variance risk in aggregate stock returns and time-varying return predictability
### Date
- Oct 2018
### Authors
- Sungjune Pyun
### Abstract
This paper introduces a new out-of-sample forecasting methodology for monthly market returns using the variance risk premium (VRP) that is both statistically and economically significant. This methodology is motivated by the ‘beta representation,’ which implies that the market risk premium is related to the price of variance risk by the variance risk exposure. Hence, when the slope of the contemporaneous regression of market returns on variance innovation is larger, future returns are more sharply related to the current VRP. Also, predictions are more accurate when market returns are highly correlated to variance shocks.

## 9. Acquirer reference prices and acquisition performance
### Date

### Abstract
In a comprehensive sample of mergers and acquisitions, we find a reference price effect: acquirers earn higher (lower) announcement-period returns when their pre-announcement stock prices are well below (near) their 52-week highs. This reference price effect is stronger in acquisitions of private targets, deals involving greater uncertainty, and acquirers with greater individual investor ownership, and it is reversed in the subsequent year. Further, acquirer reference prices affect bid premia and target announcement-period returns in deals with greater uncertainty in acquirer valuation. The overall evidence is consistent with investors irrationally using 52-week high prices as a measure of acquirer valuation.

## 10. What a difference a (birth) month makes: The relative age effect and fund manager performance

### Abstract
Many US states have a single cutoff date for school entry, meaning that some children are older than others when they begin kindergarten. We show that this variation in birth months is associated with differences in adult labor market outcomes in the mutual fund industry. Relatively older managers (i.e., those born just after the cutoff) make better stock selections, and their funds outperform their younger peers’ funds by 0.48% per annum. This difference is linked to increased confidence. Survey respondents judge relatively older managers as appearing more confident in photographs, and these managers display more confident behavior: making larger bets, window dressing their holdings less, and securing more fund flows conditional on performance.

## 11. Probability of price crashes, rational speculative bubbles, and the cross-section of stock returns
### Date
- Oct 2018
### Authors

### Abstract
We estimate an ex ante probability of extreme negative returns (crashes) of individual stocks as a measure of potential overpricing and find that stocks with a high probability of crashes earn abnormally low returns. Stocks with high crash probability are overpriced regardless of the level of institutional ownership or variations in investor sentiment, and moreover, they exhibit increasing institutional demand until their prices reach the peak of overvaluation. We also find that institutional investors who overweight high crash probability stocks outperform the others, indicating that they have skill in timing bubbles and crashes of individual stocks. Our findings imply that sophisticated investors may not always trade against mispricing but time the correction of overpricing, and suggest that the crash effect we find could arise at least partially from rational speculative bubbles, not entirely from sentiment-driven overpricing.

## 12. The present value relation over six centuries: The case of the Bazacle company
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
We study asset pricing over the longue durée using share prices and net dividends from the Bazacle company of Toulouse, the earliest documented shareholding corporation. The data extend from the firm’s foundation in 1372 to its nationalization in 1946. We find an average dividend yield of 5% per annum and near-zero long-term, real capital appreciation. Stationary dividends and stock prices enable us to directly study how prices relate to expected cash flows, without relying on a rate of return transformation. A reduced-form asset pricing model with persistent dividends and a time-varying risk correction is not rejected by the data.
