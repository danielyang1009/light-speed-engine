### Abstract
Antitrust enforcement that efficiently constrains Microsoft's behavior benefits firms supplying complements to and/or substitutes for Microsoft's operating system and applications software. However, from 1991 through 1997, 29 reports of federal antitrust enforcement action against Microsoft were accompanied by declines in the value of an index of 159 computer industry firms (excluding Microsoft). The mean loss to those firms exceeded $1 billion per event. Eight retreats or setbacks in enforcement were associated with increased computer sector value. Thus, financial markets reveal compelling evidence against the joint hypothesis that (a) Microsoft conduct is anticompetitive and (b) antitrust policy enforcement produces net efficiency gains.

## 2. Uniformly least powerful tests of market efficiency

### Abstract
Defenders of market efficiency argue that anomalies involving long-term abnormal returns are not robust to alternative methodologies. We argue that because various methodologies use different weighting schemes, the magnitude of abnormal returns should differ, and in a predictable manner. Three problems are identified that cause low power in value-weighted three-factor time series regressions when abnormal returns following managerial actions are being estimated. We illustrate the sensitivities in the context of the new issues puzzle as well as with simulations. More generally, multifactor models as currently used do not, and cannot, test market efficiency.

## 3. Managerial discipline and corporate restructuring following performance declines

### Abstract
We examine the incidence of disciplinary events that reduce the control of current managers, and corporate restructuring among firms experiencing a large decline in operating performance during an active takeover period (1985–1988) and a less active period (1989–1992). We document a significant decline in the disciplinary events from the active to the less active period that is driven by a significant decline in disciplinary takeovers, those takeovers that result in a top executive change. Following the performance decline, however, there is a substantial amount of corporate restructuring, and a significant improvement in operating performance, during both the active and the less active takeover period. We conclude that, although some managerial disciplinary events are related to overall takeover activity, the decline in takeover activity does not result in fewer performance-enhancing restructurings following performance declines.

## 4. Can transparent markets survive?

### Abstract
This paper investigates whether transparent markets can survive when faced with direct competition from less transparent markets. We first construct a game-theoretic model in which in equilibrium the low-transparency dealers capture early order flow, and use the resulting informational advantage to quote narrower spreads and earn more profits than their more transparent competitors. We then conduct a laboratory experiment that tests and supports all of these predictions. A second experiment shows that most dealers choose to be of lower transparency when they are allowed to do so. However, the informational advantage of low-transparency decreases as there are more such dealers, while the high-transparency dealers get increasing benefit from informed traders who attempt to broadcast deceptive trades. As a result, a small number of transparent dealers persist in our markets.
