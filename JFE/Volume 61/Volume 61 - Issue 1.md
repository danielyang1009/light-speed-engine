## 2. Information production, dilution costs, and optimal security design

### Abstract
We investigate the problem of a firm wishing to finance a project by issuing securities under asymmetric information. We find that, when outside investors can produce (noisy) information on the firm's quality, the degree of information asymmetry resulting in equilibrium is endogenous and depends on the information sensitivity of the security issued. Thus, in contrast to the prediction of the pecking order theory (see, e.g. Myers and Majluf, J. Financial Econom. 13 (1984) 187) a security with low sensitivity to private information, such as debt, does not always dominate one with high information sensitivity, such as equity. A firm's preference for equity rather than debt depends on the costs of information production, the precision of the information-production technology, and the extent of the information asymmetry. We also study the optimal security design problem and find that, depending on the cost and precision of the information-production technology, risky debt or a composite security with a convex payoff emerges as optimal securities.

### Abstract
We examine “realized” daily equity return volatilities and correlations obtained from high-frequency intraday transaction prices on individual stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We find that the unconditional distributions of realized variances and covariances are highly right-skewed, while the realized logarithmic standard deviations and correlations are approximately Gaussian, as are the distributions of the returns scaled by realized standard deviations. Realized volatilities and correlations show strong temporal dependence and appear to be well described by long-memory processes. Finally, there is strong evidence that realized volatilities and correlations move together in a manner broadly consistent with latent factor structure.

## 4. Short-sellers, fundamental analysis, and stock returns

### Abstract
Firms with low ratios of fundamentals (such as earning and book values) to market values are known to have systematically lower future stock returns. We document that short-sellers position themselves in the stock of such firms, and then cover their positions as the ratios mean-revert. We also show that short-sellers refine their trading strategies to minimize transactions costs and maximize their investment returns. Our evidence is consistent with short-sellers using information in these ratios to take positions in stocks with lower expected future returns.

## 5. CEO compensation and bank mergers

### Abstract
Recent bank mergers generally did not improve relative operating performance or produce positive abnormal returns to acquiring bank shareholders. We examine the relationship between mergers and CEO compensation during 1986–1995, a period marked by overcapacity and frequent mergers. We find that mergers have a net positive effect on compensation, mainly via the effect of size on compensation. Compensation generally increases even if mergers cause the acquiring bank's stock price to decline, as is typical after a merger announcement. The form of compensation affects merger decisions, since CEOs with more stock-based compensation were less likely to make an acquisition.

## 6. Firm performance and executive compensation in the savings and loan industry

### Abstract
This paper offers a new way to estimate the relation between pay and performance. In particular, unlike previous analyses, we account for the heterogeneity that theory tells us should exist across the compensation packages of different firms. Accounting for heterogeneity allows for more efficient estimates of the pay-for-performance relation and provides a means of testing the secondary hypotheses of agency theory. Among our findings are strong evidence of inter-firm heterogeneity in compensation, even within the same industry, the existence of trade-offs in using different performance measures, and insights about the factors that influence compensation packages.
