## 1. Stock splits: Signaling or liquidity? The case of ADR ‘solo-splits’
### Date

### Abstract
Stock splits should have no effect on firm value in perfect capital markets, yet stock prices increase on split announcements. The two traditional explanations are information signaling and improved liquidity for shares that trade at lower prices. We investigate these explanations by studying splits of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are not associated with splits in their home-country stock, and which represent unique illustrations of the effect of liquidity. We interpret our findings as supportive of the liquidity explanation of stock split announcement effects.

## 2. Modeling the conditional distribution of interest rates as a regime-switching process
### Date
- Sep 1996
### Author
- Stephen F. Gray
### Abstract
This paper develops a generalized regime-switching (GRS) model of the short-term interest rate. The model allows the short rate to exhibit both mean reversion and conditional heteroskedasticity and nests the popular generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and square root process specifications. The conditional variance process accommodates volatility clustering and dependence on the level of the interest rate. A first-order Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities governs the switching between regimes. The GRS model is compared with various existing models of the short rate in terms of (1) the statistical fit of short-term interest rate data and (2) out-of-sample forecasting performance.

## 3. Discriminatory versus uniform treasury auctions: Evidence from when-issued transactions
### Date

### Abstract
We use when-issued transactions data to assess the Treasury's current experiment with uniform auctions. When-issued volume is higher under uniform as compared to discriminatory auctions, suggesting a higher information release, which should reduce pre-auction uncertainty and the winner's curse. Under uniform auctions, when-issued volatility falls after the auction and again after the outcome announcement. The pattern is the opposite for discriminatory auctions. This is further evidence that uniform auctions increase pre-auction information and lower the short squeeze. A direct comparison of markups in uniform and discriminatory auctions yields mixed results.

## 4. Exchange rate variability and the riskiness of U.S. multinational firms: Evidence from the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system
### Date

### Abstract
We examine the relation between exchange rate variability and stock return volatility for U.S. multinational firms and decompose this relation into components of systematic and diversifiable risk. Focusing on two five-year periods around the 1973 switch from fixed to floating exchange rates, we find a significant increase in volatility of monthly stock returns corresponding to the period of increased exchange rate variability, even relative to the increase in stock return volatility for three control samples. In conjunction with this increase in total volatility there is also an increase in market risk (beta) for multinational firms.

## 5. Grandstanding in the venture capital industry
### Date
- Sep 1996
### Author
- Paul A. Gompers
### Abstract
I develop and test the hypothesis that young venture capital firms take companies pubic earlier than older venture capital firms in order to establish a reputation and successfully raise capital for new funds. Evidence from a sample of 433 IPOs suggests that companies backed by young venture capital firms are younger and more underpriced at their IPO than those of established venture capital firms. Moreover, young venture capital firms have been on the board of directors a shorter period of time at the IPO, hold smaller equity stakes, and time the IPO to precede or coincide with raising money for follow-on funds.
