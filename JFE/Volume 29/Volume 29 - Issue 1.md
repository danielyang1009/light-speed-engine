## 3. A unified method for pricing options on diffusion processes
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author
- David H. Goldenberg
### Abstract
This paper presents a unified method for closed-form pricing of European options on assets with diffusion prices. The method uses linear and nonlinear time and scale changes to reduce complex diffusion processes to known processes, thereby generating option pricing formulas for new diffusion processes and unifying existing results. Applications include: systematically modelling the effects on option prices of time-dependent variability in the underlying asset price, valuing futures options and options on assets showing maturity-related or seasonal volatility, valuing options on new nonconstant elasticity-of-variance diffusion processes, and pricing generalized options.

## 4. The pricing of equity offerings
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author

### Abstract
Examination of 1,600 seasoned equity offerings reveals little evidence that underwriters systematically set offer prices below the market price on the major exchanges, though they may do so for NASDAQ issues. Quick round-trip transactions in seasoned offerings are not profitable, but subscribing to an offering and holding the stock for 30 days seems to be very profitable, especially in the NASDAQ market. In addition to seasoned offerings, we analyze 250 issues of new classes of preferred stock. These issues are not underpriced.

## 5. A multicountry comparison of term-structure forecasts at long horizons
### Date

### Author
- Philippe Jorion
- Frederic Mishkin
### Abstract
This paper extends previous work on the information in the U.S. term structure at longer maturities to Britain, West Germany, and Switzerland. We find strong evidence that the term structure does have significant ability to forecast changes in inflation, particularly at long maturities. On the other hand, the ability of the term structure to forecast changes in one-year interest rates is somewhat weaker; only at the very longest horizon (five years) is there significant forecasting ability for interest-rate changes.

## 6. The postmerger share-price performance of acquiring firms
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author

- Robert Harris
- Sheridan Titman
### Abstract
This paper investigates share-price performance following corporate takeovers. We use multifactor benchmarks from the portfolio evaluation literature that overcome some of the known mean-variance inefficiencies of more traditional single-factor benchmarks. Studying 399 U.S. takeovers consummated in the 1975–1984 period, we conclude that previous findings of poor performance afer takeover are likely due to benchmark errors rather than mispricing at the time of the takeover.

## 7. The consumption of stockholders and nonstockholders
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author
- N.Gregory Mankiw
- Stephen P. Zeldes
### Abstract
Only one-fourth of U.S. families own stock. This paper examines whether the consumption of stockholders differs from the consumption of nonstockholders and, if so, whether these differences help explain the empirical failures of the consumption-based CAPM. Household panel data are used to construct time series on the consumption of each group. The results indicate that the consumption of stockholders is more volatile and more highly correlated with the excess return on the stock market. These differences help explain the size of the equity premium, although they do not fully resolve the equity premium puzzle.

## 8. Underwriter warrants, underwriter compensation, and the costs of going public
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author

- Michael R. Vetsuypens
### Abstract
Warrants are sometimes granted to underwriters in initial public offerings as part of the compensation for their services. We examine the effects of underwriter warrants in a sample of firm commitment offerings from 1983 through 1987. These warrants represent a significant component of the compensation to the underwriter and are associated with greater total costs of going public. Warrants appear to provide a mechanism for circumventing otherwise binding regulatory constraints, allowing issuers to offer extra compensation to underwriters marketing especially risky offerings.

## 9. Opportunistic underinvestment in debt renegotiation and capital structure
### Date
- Mar 1991
### Author
- Yaacov Z. Bergman
- Jeffrey L. Callen
### Abstract
This paper models debt renegotiation as a bargaining game between debtholders and shareholder-oriented management, in which management credibly threatens to run down firm assets to force concessions from the creditors. Creditors anticipate this opportunistic behavior by management, creating an upper bound on debt capacity that is less than the value of the firm. If an advantage to debt is introduced, such as favorable tax treatment, an interior optimal capital structure obtains even in the absence of realized bankruptcy costs. Our model also explains variations in debt-equity ratios and the use of certain puzzling debt covenants.

## 10. Underwritten calls of convertible bonds
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
Common-stock prices fall a statistically significant 2 percent in response to underwritten convertible debt call announcements. We find that the significant negative price reaction is confined to underwritten calls — stock-price responses to non-underwritten calls average an insignificant −0.84 percent. The results support the idea that managers are more likely to use underwriters the more unfavorable the information they possess about future firm cash flows. An agency cost interpretation of underwritten calls is also consistent with the results, but is not supported by management ownership and corporate liquidity evidence.
