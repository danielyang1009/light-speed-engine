## 2. Habit persistence and durability in aggregate consumption

### Abstract
Habit persistence in preferences and durability of consumption goods both imply time-nonseparability in the derived utility for consumption expenditures. We study a simple model with both effects. Lagged consumption expenditures enter the Euler equation, where habit persistence implies that their coefficients are negative and durability implies positive coefficients. Estimating the sign of the coefficients addresses the question of which effect is dominant. Earlier empirical work on monthly data supports the durability of consumption expenditures. We find evidence in monthly, quarterly, and annual data that habit persistence dominates the effect of durability.

## 3. Proxy voting and the SEC
### Date
- Oct 1991
### Author
- John Pound
### Abstract
This paper analyzes the SEC's proxy regulations and assesses their effects on corporate governance. The proxy rules began in 1935 as a minimal series of disclosure requirements and a prohibition against fraud. By 1956, they imposed extensive and wide-ranging disclosure requirements on anyone wishing to communicate about voting issues and required that all such communications be cleared in advance — in essence, censored — by the SEC. I present evidence that since that time, the rules have significantly increased the costs of communication and coordinated action among shareholders. They have thus deterred shareholder initiatives and inhibited the development of a private market for information about voting issues.

## 4. The staying power of leveraged buyouts
### Date
- Oct 1991
### Author
- Steven N. Kaplan
### Abstract
This paper documents the organizational status over time of 183 large leveraged buyouts completed between 1979 and 1986. By August 1990, 62% of the LBOs are privately owned, 14% are independent public companies, and 24% are owned by other public companies. The percentage of LBOs returning to public ownership increases over time, with LBOs remaining private for a median time of 6.82 years. The majority of LBOs, therefore, are neither short-lived nor permanent. The moderate fraction of LBO assets owned by other companies implies that asset sales play a role, but are not the primary motivating force in LBO transactions.

## 5. A test of the free cash flow hypothesis
### Date
- Oct 1991
### Author

### Abstract
We develop a measure of free cash flow using Tobin's q to distinguish between firms that have good investment opportunities and those that do not. In a sample of successful tender offers, bidder returns are significantly negatively related to cash flow for low q bidders but not for high q bidders; further, the relation between cash flow and bidder returns differs significantly for low q and high q bidders. This result holds for several cash flow measures suggested in the literature and also in multivariate regressions controlling for bidder and contest-specific characteristics.

## 6. Were Japanese stock prices too high?
### Date
- Oct 1991
### Author
- Kenneth R. French
- James M. Poterba
### Abstract
This paper asks whether market fundamentals can explain the recent run-up and decline of Japanese equity values and price-earnings ratios. Accounting differences explain about half of the long-run disparity between U.S. and Japanese P/Es. For example, if Japanese firms used U.S. accounting rules, the Japanese P/E ratio would have been 32.6, not 53.7, in 1989. Accounting differences cannot, however, explain the doubling of this ratio in 1986, nor its decline in 1990. Similarly, we are unable to isolate changes in required stock returns or growth expectations that are large enough to explain recent Japanese stock price movements.

## 7. Components of short-horizon individual security returns

### Abstract
In this paper, we present a simple model which relates security returns to three components: an expected return, a bid-ask error, and white noise. The relative importance of the various components is empirically assessed, and the model's ability to explain the various time-series properties of individual security and portfolio returns is tested. Time-varying expected returns and bid-ask errors are found to explain substantial proportions (up to 24%) of the variance of security returns. We also reconcile the typically negative autocorrelation in security returns with the strong positive autocorrelation in portfolio returns.
