## 3. Managerial discretion and optimal financing policies
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
I analyze financing policies in a firm owned by atomistic shareholders who observe neither cash flows nor management's investment decisions. Management derives perquisites from investment and invests as much as possible. Since it always claims that cash flow is too low fund all positive net present value projects, its claim is not credible when cash flow is truly low. Consequently, management is forced to invest too little when cash flow is low and chooses to invest too much when it is high. Financing policies, by influencing the resources under management's control, can reduce the costs of over- and underinvestment.

## 4. The numeraire portfolio
### Date

### Authors
- John B. Long
### Abstract
A portfolio formed from a given list of assets is defined as a numeraire portfolio for the list if (a) it is self-financing, (b) its value is always positive, and (c) zero is always the best conditional forecast of the numeraire-dominated rate of return of every asset on the list. The numeraire portfolio exists if and only if there are no profit opportunities from trading assets on the list. For a sample list of heterogeneous assets (NYSE size-quintile portfolios, corporate bonds, and short-term bills), numeraire-dominated returns are similar to market-model forecast errors and, as abnormal return measures, clearly dominate market-adjusted returns.

## 5. Large-block transactions, the speed of response, and temporary and permanent stock-price effects
### Date

### Abstract
The paper investigates how quickly prices attain new equilibrium levels after large-block transactions, and measures the associated temporary and permanent price effects. We find that prices adjust within at most three trades, with most of the adjustment occurring in the first trade. The temporary price effect for seller-initiated transactions is related to block size, but the temporary price effect observed for buyer-initiated transactions is no larger than that observed in 100 share trades. Most of the price effect associated with block trades is permanent and is related to block size, regardless of the initiating party.

## 6. The valuation of options on yields
### Date
- Jul 1990
### Authors
- Francis A. Longstaff
### Abstract
Many contingent claims incorporate options on yield levels. I derive closed-form expressions for European yield-option prices using a general equilibrium model in which the underlying yield is the relevant state variable. The properties of these options differ markedly from those of conventional options on traded assets. For example, yield-call values can be less than their intrinsic value and can be decreasing functions of the underlying yield. These features have important hedging implications. I examine the empirical implications of the model using price data for the 13-week T-bill options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

## 7. The seemingly anomalous price behavior of Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever N.V./PLC
### Date
- Jul 1990
### Authors
- Leonard Rosenthal
- Colin Young
### Abstract
We examine two Anglo-Dutch groups the shares of whose parents trade on several international exchanges. Within each group, the parents' corporate charters mandate the division of cash flows available for distribution. This implies a specific ratio for the market prices of their securities. We document persistent deviations from these ratios on both the New York and London exchanges. The direction and magnitude of the mispricing are common to both pairs of stocks and both markets. Nevertheless, we find no evidence of profitable intra- or intermarket trading rules.

## 8. Information effects in financial distress

### Abstract
In 1972 a group of electric utilities announced plans to construct Seabrook Station, a nuclear generating facility. In 1988, the lead partner in the venture, Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), filed for bankruptcy. Examination of the stock price effects of a variety of financial events preceding the bankruptcy filing shows that information about cash flows paid to PSNH security holders affected the common stock prices of PSNH and its Seabrook partners. whereas information about investment and operating cash flows had little or no effect.
