## 2. Outside directors, board independence, and shareholder wealth

### Abstract
Management plays a dominant role in selecting outside directors, inviting skepticism about outsiders' ability to make independent judgments on firm performance. Our examination of wealth effects surrounding outside director appointments finds significantly positive share-price reactions. We find no clear evidence that outside directors of any particular occupation are more or less valuable than others. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that outside directors are chosen in the interest of shareholders.

## 3. Dividend clienteles and the information content of dividend changes

### Abstract
We reason that dividend-yield surprises are perfectly correlated with dividend surprises. If investors with preference for dividends are the marginal investors in high-yield stocks, the price reaction to a dividend change should be larger, the higher the anticipated yield of the stock. An examination of over 8,500 dividend changes shows that price reactions to dividend increases are significantly more positive and to dividend decreases significantly more negative for high-yield stocks. Also, the price reactions to dividend changes are larger and the yield effect is stronger for low-priced and small-firm stocks, perhaps because of greater information content and higher transaction costs.

## 4. Bayesian inference in asset pricing tests

### Abstract
We test the mean-variance efficiency of a given portfolio using a Bayesian framework. Our test is more direct than Shanken's (1987b), because we impose a prior on all the parameters of the multivariate regression model. The approach is also easily adapted to other problems. We use Monte Carlo numerical integration to accurately evaluate 90-dimensional integrals. Posterior-odds ratios are calculated for 12 industry portfolios from 1926–1987. The sensitivity of the inferences to the prior is investigated by using three different distributions. The probability that the given portfolio is mean-variance efficient is small for a range of plausible priors.

## 5. Corporate research and development expenditures and share value

### Abstract
Share-price responses to 95 announcements of increased research and development (R & D) spending are significantly positive on average, even when the announcement occurs in the face of an earnings decline. High-technology firms that announce increases in R & D spending experience positive abnormal returns on average, whereas announcements by low-technology firms are associated with negative abnormal returns. Further, in our cross-sectional analyses we find that higher R & D intensity than the industry average leads to larger stock-price increases only for firms in high-technology industries.

## 6. Plant-closing decisions and the market value of the firm
### Date

### Abstract
We investigate the underlying causes and the announcement effects of plant closings. The closing in our sample do not appear related to takeover activity. Instead, they appear motivated by declining firm profitability. Firms announcing closings have lower earnings than market or industry medians; earnings typically improve slightly after the announcement. We find a negative stock-market reaction to plant-closing announcements.

## 7. The role of financial innovation in raising capital Evidence from deep discount debt offers
### Date

### Abstract
We investigate the market's reaction to original-issue deep discount (OID) bonds, which are issued at prices well below par and with coupons set below the market rate. Until July 1982 OID debt offered large tax advantages. Before that date stock-price responses to announcements of OID debt are significantly positive, in contrast to the negative, albeit insignificant, responses associated with par debt announcements. No stock-price gains are observed for OID debt issued after the tax advantages are removed. We conclude that in 1981–82 opportunities provided by financial innovation offset the negative information effects typically associated with debt-financing announcements.
