## 3. Trading rules, large blocks and the speed of price adjustment

### Abstract
In this paper large block stock transactions are examined in the context of a trading rule devised by Grier and Albin. The study makes use of the actual intra-day history of stock transactions. Considerable effort is taken to correctly incorporate the effects of transaction costs on trading rule profits and evidence is presented on the sensitivity of such profits to variations in these costs. The use of intra-day prices yields results consistent with the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis and provides important evidence on the speed of price adjustment.

## 4. The impact of maturity regulation on high interest rate lenders and borrowers
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
The State of Maine recently imposed an additional regulation on the maturity of small loans offered by finance companies, presumably to protect the consumer. The effectively restricted the maturity of these high interest rate loans to 36 months. Within five years, the number of licensees (finance company offices) declined from 116 to 24. Within another five years, all of these lenders had completely ceased operations. Hypotheses on the effect and value to consumers of the regulation are stated operationally and tested empirically. This study includes estimation of the loan companies' cost function, (accounting) profit rates and output and a survey of the individuals directly affected by the demise of the companies. The analysis indicates (1) that the maturity restriction made ordinary operations unprofitable, (2) why this occurred, and (3) that half of the consumers did not obtain funds elsewhere.

## 5. Stock exchange seats as capital assets
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
Stock exchange seats are important assets for securities brokers since they provide access to centralized secondary trading markets for corporate securities at a reduced cost. This paper provides empirical evidence on the dynamic behavior of monthly New York and American Stock Exchange seat prices over the 1926–1972 period. Specifically, evidence is presented which: (a) is consistent with a multiplicative random walk model for seat prices; (b) indicates that unexpected changes in the prices of exchange-listed stocks or in the volume of shares traded on the exchange are important new information about the value of seats in each month; and (c) indicates that the market for seats is efficient in assimilating new information and quickly incorporates new information into the prices of seats. In addition, we examine the effect of the infrequent trading of seats on the statistical properties of the models.

## 6. The valuation of warrants: Implementing a new approach
### Date
- Jan 1977
### Authors
- Eduardo S. Schwartz
### Abstract
The option pricing model developed by Black and Scholes and extended by Merton gives rise to partial differential equations governing the value of an option. When the underlying stock pays no dividends – and in some very restrictive cases when it does – a closed form solution to the differential equation subject to the appropriate boundary conditions, has been obtained. But, in some relevant cases such as the one in which the stock pays discrete dividends, no closed form solution has been found. This paper shows how to solve these equations by numerical methods. In addition, the optimal strategy for exercising American options is derived. A numerical illustration of the procedure is also presented.

## 7. Human capital and capital market equilibrium
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
This paper finds that extending popular two-parameter models of capital market equilibrium to allow for the existence of non-marketable human capital does not provide better empirical descriptions of the expected return-risk relationship for marketable securities than those that come out of the simpler models. This conclusion arises from the fact that relationships between the return on human capital and the returns on various marketable assets are weak, so that the model that includes human capital leads to estimates of risk for marketable assets indistinguishable from those of the simpler models.
