## 2. Dealer versus auction markets: A paired comparison of execution costs on NASDAQ and the NYSE
### Date

### Abstract
Execution costs, as measured by the quoted spread, the effective spread (which accounts for trades inside the quotes), the realized spread (which measures revenues of suppliers of immediacy), the Roll (1984) implied spread, and the post-trade variability, are twice as large for a sample of NASDAQ stocks as they are for a matched sample of NYSE stocks. The difference is not due to differences in adverse information, in market depth, or in the frequency of even-eighth quotes. Partial explanations are provided by differences in the treatment of limit orders and commissions in the two markets. We conclude that important explanations are the internalization and preferencing of order flow and the presence of alternative interdealer trading systems, factors that limit dealers' incentives to narrow spreads on NASDAQ.

## 3. Detecting abnormal operating performance: The empirical power and specification of test statistics
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
This research evaluates methods used in event studies that employ accounting-based measures of operating performance. We examine the choice of an accounting-based performance measure, a statistical test, and a model of expected operating performance. We document the impact of these choices on the test statistics designed to detect abnormal operating performance. We find that commonly used research designs yield test statistics that are misspecified in cases where sample firms have performed either unusually well or poorly. In this sampling situation, the test statistics are only well specified when sample firms are matched to control firms of similar pre-event performance.

## 4. Commonality in the determinants of expected stock returns
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
We find that the determinants of the cross-section of expected stock returns are stable in their identity and influence from period to period and from country to country. Out-of-sample predictions of expected return are strongly and consistently accurate. Two findings distinguish this paper from others in the contemporary literature: First, stocks with higher expected and realized rates of return are unambiguously lower in risk than stocks with lower returns. Second, the important determinants of expected stock returns are strikingly common to the major equity markets of the world. Overall, the results seem to reveal a major failure in the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.

## 5. Market microstructure and asset pricing: On the compensation for illiquidity in stock returns
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
Models of price formation in securities markets suggest that privately informed investors create significant illiquidity costs for uninformed investors, implying that the required rates of return should be higher for securities that are relatively illiquid. We investigate the empirical relation between monthly stock returns and measures of illiquity obtained from intraday data. We find a significant relation between required rates of return and these measures after adjusting for the Fama and French risk factors, and also after accounting for the effects of the stock price level.

## 6. Why Nasdaq market makers avoid odd-eighth quotes
### Date
- Jul 1996
### Authors
- Paul E. Godek
### Abstract
Recent studies argue that implicit collusion explains the tendency of Nasdaq market makers to avoid odd-eighth price quotes. This paper focuses on the role that preference trading plays in determining quoted spreads. Under the postulated effects of preference trading, an analysis of the relation between spreads and price fractions explains the paucity of odd-eighth quotes on Nasdaq. Empirical results from a comprehensive data set show that exogenous economic characteristics explain the distribution of price fractions across securities, and illustrate the stability of that distribution over time. These results contradict empirical results offered as support for the collusion hypothesis.

## 7. Perceptions and the politics of finance: Junk bonds and the regulatory seizure of first capital life

### Abstract
In May 1991, one month after seizing Executive Life, California regulators seized First Capital Life (FCLIC). Both insurers were Drexel clients with large junk bond holdings, and both had experienced ‘bank runs’. FCLIC's run followed regulators' televised comments that its poor condition necessitated a substantial cash infusion. Yet FCLIC's statutory capital — with junk bonds, real estate, and mortgages marked to market — was far from lowest among major insurers with California policyholders. It becomes lowest if junk bonds alone are marked to market at year-end 1990 (ignoring larger market declines in real estate/mortgages and the junk bond market's 21% return in early 1991). Our findings suggest a regulatory bias against junk bonds in the political backlash against the 1980s.
