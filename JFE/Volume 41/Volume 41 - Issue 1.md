## 3. The structure of mutual fund charges
### Date

### Abstract
This paper provides an explanation for the diversity in investment strategies and fees of open-end mutual funds. Mutual funds seek to dissuade redemptions through front- and back-end load fees. The empirical evidence is consistent with model predictions that such fees dissuade redemptions in open-end funds, and that funds hold more cash when there is uncertainty about redemptions. Furthermore, funds with load and redemption fees hold less cash that their no-load counterparts. The results suggest that aggressive funds are sensitive to cash flows and are likely to rely on fees to dissuade redemptions.

## 4. Debt and the marginal tax rate
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
Do taxes affect corporate debt policy? This paper tests whether the incremental use of debt is positively related to simulated firm-specific marginal tax rates that account for net operating losses, investment tax credits, and the alternative minimum tax. The simulated marginal tax rates exhibit substantial variation due to the dynamics of the tax code, tax regime shifts, business cycle effects, and the progressive nature of the statutory tax schedule. Using annual data from more than 10,000 firms for the years 1980–1992, I provide evidence which indicates that high-tax-rate firms issue more debt than their low-tax-rate counterparts.

## 5. The term structure of interest rates in a pure exchange economy with heterogeneous investors
### Date
- May 1996
### Author
- Jiang Wang
### Abstract
This paper presents an equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates when investors have heterogeneous preferences. The basic model considers a pure exchange economy of two classes of investors with different (but constant) relative risk aversion and gives closed-form solutions to bond prices. I use the model to examine the effect of preference heterogeneity on the behavior of bond yields. The model is also extended to cases of more than two classes of investors.

## 6. The market's response to recurring events the case of stock splits

### Abstract
A substantial body of literature suggests that stock splits convey information. In this paper we extend this literature by examining firms that split their stock at least twice during 1970–1988. We focus on firms with multiple splits to provide evidence on the market's use of previous split experience in interpreting a recurring event. Our major findings are that stock price responses to both stock splits and post-split earnings changes depend on earnings realizations observed after previous splits. These findings support the conclusion that the market uses previous split experience to interpret a recurring event.

## 7. Order characteristics and stock price evolution An application to program trading
### Date
- May 1996
### Author
- Joel Hasbrouck
### Abstract
This paper is an econometric analysis of the information content of automated orders arriving at the NYSE. The model captures the joint behavior of automated orders and also the return on the stock index future and the futures-spot basis. The results indicate that orders contain information useful in predicting stock returns beyond the information contained in the reported trades. Furthermore, program and index-arbitrage orders contain information beyond that available from the futures return and basis, suggesting that these orders are not merely passive conveyors of common-factor information. Nonprogram, program, and index-arbitrage orders have roughly similar price impacts.
