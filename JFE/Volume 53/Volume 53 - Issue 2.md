## 1. Ex-day behavior with dividend preference and limitations to short-term arbitrage: the case of Swedish lottery bonds

### Abstract
Swedish lottery bonds offer a unique opportunity to study ex-day effects in an environment where cash distributions are tax-advantaged relative to capital gains. Thus, in the lottery bond market, we observe a reversal of the preference for capital gains that researchers have cited as an explanation for the ex-day behavior of U.S. equities. Further, in this market there are barriers to short-term arbitrage when prices do reflect the tax preferences of individual investors. We find the bonds are priced around the ex-day to reflect differential tax rates on income and capital gains consistent with the prevailing tax regimes. The bonds consistently experience negative returns over the coupon payment period, and in fact often sell at negative yields prior to the cash distribution, as one would expect given tax-motivated trading between high-tax investors, who buy prior to the distribution, and low-tax investors, who buy after the distribution.

## 2. How are stock prices affected by the location of trade?

### Abstract
We examine pairs of large, `Siamese twin’ companies whose stocks are traded around the world but have different trading and ownership habitats. Twins pool their cash flows, so, with integrated markets, twin stocks should move together. However, the difference between the prices of twin stocks appears to be correlated with the markets on which they are traded most, i.e., a twin's relative price rises when the market on which it is traded relatively intensively rises. We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems.

## 3. Share issue privatizations as financial means to political and economic ends

### Abstract
This study examines how political and economic factors affect the offer price, share allocation, and other terms governments choose when they privatize state-owned enterprises via a public share offering. Using a 59 country sample of 630 share issue privatizations (SIPs) with total proceeds of over $446 billion during the period 1977–1997, we find that governments consistently underprice SIP offers, tilt their share allocation patterns to favour domestic investors, impose control restrictions on privatized firms, and typically use fixed-price offers rather than book building or competitive tender offers, all to further political and economic policy objectives.

## 4. Limit orders and the bid–ask spread

### Abstract
We examine the role of limit-order traders and specialists in the market-making process. We find that a large portion of posted bid–ask quotes originates from the limit-order book without direct participation by specialists, and that competition between traders and specialists has a significant impact on the bid–ask spread. Specialists’ spreads are widest at the open, narrow until late morning, and then level off. The U-shaped intraday pattern of spreads largely reflects the intraday variation in spreads established by limit-order traders. Lastly, the intraday variation in limit-order spreads is significantly related to the intraday variation in limit-order placements and executions.

## 5. The performance of investment newsletters

### Abstract
This paper analyzes the recommendations of common stocks made by the investment newsletters followed by the Hulbert Financial Digest. We conclude that, taken as a whole, the securities that newsletters recommend do not outperform appropriate benchmarks. Our data provide modest evidence that the future performance of a newsletter is related to its past performance, when performance is measure by raw returns. Evidence of persistence vanishes, however, when performance is measured by abnormal returns. We find little, if any, evidence of herding, i.e., cross-sectional dependence of recommendations, across newsletters. Newsletters tend to recommend securities that have performed well in the recent past. Finally, newsletters with poor past performance are more likely to go out of business.
