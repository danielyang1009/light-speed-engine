### Abstract
We examine the importance of stockholder–bondholder conflicts in capital-structure choice. Numerical techniques are used to compute the expected wealth transfer between stockholders and bondholders when a firm adopts a new project. We characterize the set of positive NPV projects that stockholders prefer to ignore and the set of negative NPV projects that stockholders want to accept. The results illustrate how these distortions vary with firm and project characteristics. We also estimate the impact of stockholder–bondholder conflicts on investment decisions for 23 different firms and examine the extent to which stockholder-bondholder conflicts explain observed cross-sectional variation in capital structures.

## 2. The sensitivity of CEO wealth to equity risk: an analysis of the magnitude and determinants

### Abstract
To control risk-related incentive problems, equity holders are expected to manage both the convexity and slope of the relation between firm performance and managers’ wealth. I find stock options, but not common stockholdings, significantly increase the sensitivity of CEOs’ wealth to equity risk. Cross-sectionally, this sensitivity is positively related to firms’ investment opportunities. This result is consistent with managers receiving incentives to invest in risky projects when the potential loss from underinvestment in valuable risk-increasing projects is greatest. Firms’ stock-return volatility is positively related to the convexity provided to managers, suggesting convex incentive schemes influence investing and financing decisions.

## 3. Information asymmetry, valuation, and the corporate spin-off decision

### Abstract
We empirically analyze the information hypothesis that the separation of a firm's divisions into independently traded units through a spin-off enhances value because it mitigates information asymmetry about the firm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that firms that engage in spin-offs have higher levels of information asymmetry compared to their industry and size matched counterparts and the information problems decrease significantly after the spin-off. The gains around spin-offs are positively related to the degree of information asymmetry, and this relation is more pronounced for firms with fewer negative synergies between divisions. Finally, firms with higher growth opportunities and firms in need of external capital show a higher propensity to engage in spin-offs. They also raise more capital following a spin-off, which is consistent with the view that these firms mitigate information asymmetry before approaching the capital market for funds.

## 4. Board meeting frequency and firm performance

### Abstract
For 307 firms over the 1990–1994 period, I find that board meeting frequency is related to corporate governance and ownership characteristics in a manner that is consistent with contracting and agency theory. The annual number of board meetings is inversely related to firm value. This result is driven by increases in board activity following share price declines. I further find that operating performance improves following years of abnormal board activity. These improvements are most pronounced for firms with poor prior performance and firms not engaged in corporate control transactions. Overall, my results suggest that board activity, measured by board meeting frequency, is an important dimension of board operations.
