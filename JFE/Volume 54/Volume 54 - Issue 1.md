## 1. The time-series relations among expected return, risk, and book-to-market

### Abstract
This paper examines the time-series relations among expected return, risk, and book-to-market (B/M) at the portfolio level. I find that B/M predicts economically and statistically significant time-variation in expected stock returns. Further, B/M is strongly associated with changes in risk, as measured by the Fama and French (1993) (Journal of Financial Economics, 33, 3–56) three-factor model. After controlling for risk, B/M provides no incremental information about expected returns. The evidence suggests that the three-factor model explains time-varying expected returns better than a characteristics-based model.

## 2. The long-run performance of stock returns following debt offerings

### Abstract
We document substantial long-run post-issue underperformance by firms making straight and convertible debt offerings from 1975 to 1989. This long-run underperformance is more severe for smaller, younger, and NASDAQ-listed firms, and for firms issuing speculative grade debt. We also find strong evidence that the underperformance of issuers of both straight and convertible debt is limited to those issues that occur in periods with a high volume of issues. In contrast to earlier event studies that found insignificantly negative abnormal returns at the time of debt issue announcements and concluded that debt offerings had no impact on shareholder wealth, our results suggest that debt offerings, like equity offerings, are signals that the firm is overvalued. As with equity offerings and repurchases, the market appears to underreact at the time of the debt offering announcement so that the full impact of the offering is only realized over a longer time horizon.

## 3. Firm performance and focus: long-run stock market performance following spinoffs

### Abstract
We examine whether an increase in focus is an explanation for the stock market gains associated with spinoffs. For a sample of 155 spinoffs between the years 1975 and 1991, we find that the announcement period as well the long-run abnormal returns for the focus-increasing spinoffs are significantly larger than the corresponding abnormal returns for the non-focus-increasing spinoffs. The results for the change in operating performance are consistent with those for the stock market performance. Cross-sectionally, the stock market performance as well as the operating performance are positively associated with change in focus. An analysis of the non-focus-increasing spinoffs shows that the firms are likely to undertake these spinoffs to separate underperforming subsidiaries from the parents.

## 4. GMM tests of stochastic discount factor models with useless factors

### Abstract
This paper studies generalized method of moments tests for the stochastic discount factor representation of asset pricing models when one of the proposed factors is in fact useless, defined as being independent of the asset returns. Analytic results on asymptotic distributions and simulation results on finite sample distributions both show that (i) the Wald test tends to overreject the hypothesis of a zero factor premium for a useless factor when the model is misspecified, (ii) with the presence of a useless factor, the power of the over-identifying restriction test in rejecting misspecified models is reduced, and in some cases a misspecified model with a useless factor is more likely to be accepted than the true model.
