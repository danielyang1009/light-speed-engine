## 2. Causes of financial distress following leveraged recapitalizations
### Date

### Abstract
We report that 31% of the firms completing leveraged recapitalizations between 1985 and 1988 subsequently encounter financial distress. Following their recaps, the distressed firms exhibit (1) poor operating performance due largely to industry-wide problems, (2) surprisingly low proceeds from asset sales, and (3) negative stock price reactions to economic and regulatory events associated with the demise of the market for highly-leveraged transactions. The incidence of distress is not related to several characteristics that have previously been linked with poorly-structured deals. We thus attribute the high rate of distress primarily to unexpected macroeconomic and regulatory developments.

## 3. CEO turnover and the firm's investment decisions
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
This paper examines the relation between management turnover and divestitures of recently acquired divisions. The empirical results indicate that at the time of a management change, there is an increased probability of divesting an acquisition at a loss or one considered unprofitable by the press. The probability increases by about the same amount regardless of whether the change is an apparent age-65 retirement or a resignation. Overall, the results are consistent with a variety of agency-based theories of corporate investment and suggest that management changes are important events for corporations because they lead to reversals of poor prior decisions.

## 4. Increased debt and industry product markets an empirical analysis
### Date
- Feb 1995
### Authors
- Gordon M. Phillips
### Abstract
This paper tests for changes in firms' production and pricing decisions in four industries in which firms have sharply increased their financial leverage. The analysis of product price and quantity data shows that industry product market decisions are associated with capital structure. In three industries, output is negatively associated with the average industry debt ratio. In the one industry which shows a positive association between output and debt ratios, rival firms have low financial leverage and entry barriers are relatively low. Analysis of executive compensation data supports the hypothesis that managers' incentives to maximize shareholders' wealth increase following recapitalization.

## 5. Evidence on the strategic allocation of initial public offerings
### Date
- Feb 1995
### Authors

- William J. Wilhelm
### Abstract
The evidence reported in this paper suggests that institutional investors capture a large fraction of the short-run profits associated with IPOs. The favored status enjoyed by institutional investors in underpriced offerings appears, however, to carry a quid pro quo expectation that they will participate in less-attractive issues as well. This finding conforms with the Benveniste and Spindt (1989) and Benveniste and Wilhelm (1990) prediction that U.S. underwriters behave strategically in the allocation of IPOs.
