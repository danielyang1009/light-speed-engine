## 2. Incentives, downsizing, and value creation at general dynamics

### Abstract
In 1991, defense contractor General Dynamics engaged a new management team which adopted an explicit corporate objective of creating shareholder value. The company tied executive compensation to shareholder wealth creation, and subsequently implemented a strategy that included downsizing, restructuring, and exit. Paying large executive cash bonuses amid layoffs ignited controversy. However, by 1993 shareholders realized gains approaching $4.5 billion, representing a dividend-reinvested return of 553%. The study shows how incentives assist in shaping strategy, illustrates the political costs and economic benefits of downsizing and demonstrates that even firms in declining industries have substantial opportunities for value creation.

## 3. The Nestlé crash
### Date

### Abstract
On November 17, 1988, the board of directors of Nestlé AG decided to allow foreign investors to hold Nestlé registered stock, reversing a longstanding practice. This decision had a tremendous impact on the prices of the firm's three classes of common stock, as well as on the prices of several other corporations traded on the Zürich stock exchange. These price changes can be explained by the hypothesis that demand curves slope down.

## 4. Closed-end fund premia and returns implications for financial market equilibrium
### Date
- Mar 1995
### Author
- Jeffrey Pontiff
### Abstract
This paper examines the relation between closed-end fund premia and returns. Additional evidence is provided on Thompson's (1978) finding that fund premia are negatively correlated with future returns. Funds with 20% discounts have expected twelve-month returns that are 6% greater than nondiscounted funds. This correlation is attributed to premium mean-reversion, not to anticipated future portfolio performance. Economically motivated explanations do not account for this effect.

## 5. Anatomy of the trading process empirical evidence on the behavior of institutional traders

### Abstract
This paper examines the behavior of institutional traders. We use unique data on the equity transactions of 21 institutions of differing investment styles which provide a detailed account of the anatomy of the trading process. The data include information on the number of days needed to fill an order and types of order placement strategies employed. We analyze the motivations for trade, the determinants of trade duration, and the choice of order type. The analysis provides some support for the predictions made by theoretical models, but suggests that these models fail to capture important dimensions of trading behavior.

## 6. Stock returns and volatility a firm-level analysis
### Date
- Mar 1995
### Author
- Gregory R. Duffee
### Abstract
It has been previously documented that individual firms' stock return volatility rises after stock prices fall. This paper finds that this statistical relation is largely due to a positive contemporaneous relation between firm stock returns and firm stock return volatility. This positive relation is strongest for both small firms and firms with little financial leverage. At the aggregate level, the sign of this contemporaneous relation is reversed. The reasons for the difference between the aggregate- and firm-level relations are explored.

## 7. Does the market react differently to domestic and foreign takeover announcements? Evidence from the U.S. chemical and retail industries
### Date
- Mar 1995
### Author
- Kathryn L. Dewenter
### Abstract
This paper examines shareholder wealth gains from domestic and foreign takeover announcements in the U.S. chemical and retail industries. Contrary to results in several recent papers, these data indicate there is no significant difference in within industry mean takeover premia levels. There is evidence, though, that the sensitivity of takeover premia levels to standard transaction characteristics does differ across buyers: Foreign investors do pay more than domestic investors in hostile transactions, but pay less when there are rival bidders. The results indicate the market's reaction to buyer nationality is closely tied to the transaction's characteristics.
