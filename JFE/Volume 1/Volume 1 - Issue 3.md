## 1. Convergence to isoelastic utility and policy in multiperiod portfolio choice
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
This paper considers the problem of the investor who has numerous opportunities for revising his portfolio and whose choices are governed by a utility function defined on ‘terminal’ wealth, U0(x0). Attention is focussed on the behavior of the induced utility functions of intermediate wealth with n periods to go, Un(xn), and the associated investment policies. Conditions under which the functions Un(xn) will tend to isoelasticity have previously been given by Mossin and by Leland. In this paper, the conditions for convergence are weakened further, to the point where they appear sufficiently broad to encompass perhaps most utility functions of practical interest.

## 2. An aggregation theorem for securities markets
### Date
- Sep 1974
### Author
- Mark Rubinstein
### Abstract
Alternative sets of sufficient conditions are developed under which equilibrium security rates of return are determined as if there exist only identical individuals whose resources, beliefs, and tastes are a composite of the actual individuals in the economy. These conditions include as special cases all those previously examined in the literature (including conditions sufficient to produce the two-parameter mean-variance model), as well as others. Whenever such a composite individual exists it is shown that (1) valuation equations take a specific form and contain only exogenous parameters of the economy; (2) market exchange arrangements are Pareto-optimal; and (3) competitive value-maximizing firms make completely specified Pareto-optimal production decisions both over dates and states. These results rely on the observation that under popular homogeneity assumptions regarding beliefs and tastes, even though the securities market may be incomplete, equilibrium rates of return are determined as if there were an otherwise similar Arrow-Debreu economy.

## 3. Money and stock prices
### Date
- Sep 1974
### Author

### Abstract
This paper examines stock market efficiency with respect to money supply data by testing (1) regression models of stock returns on monetary variables and (2) trading rules based on money supply data. The evidence indicates no meaningful lag in the effect of monetary policy on the stock market and that no profitable security trading rules using past values of the money supply exist. Therefore this evidence is consistent with the efficient market model. Current security returns incorporate all information contained in past money supply data and, in addition, appear to anticipate future changes in the money supply. A number of previous studies have concluded that lags exist and can be used in profitable trading rules. Analysis of these studies demonstrates that for a variety of reasons the evidence in these past studies does not sustain such conclusions.
