## 2. The effects of dividend yield and dividend policy on common stock prices and returns
### Date

### Abstract
This paper suggests that it is not possible to demonstrate, using the best available empirical methods, that the expected returns on high yield common stocks differ from the expected returns on low yield common stocks either before or after taxes. A taxable investor who concentrates his portfolio in low yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected after-tax return by so doing. A tax exempt investor who concentrates his portfolio in high yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected return. We argue that the best method for testing the effects of dividend policy on stock prices is to test the effects of dividend yield on stock returns. Thus the fact that we cannot tell, using the best available methods, what effects dividend yield has on stock returns implies that we cannot tell what effect, if any, a change in dividend policy will have on a corporation's stock price.

## 3. Portfolio theory, job choice and the equilibrium structure of expected wages
### Date
- May 1974
### Author
- David Mayers
### Abstract
This paper presents some of the implications of modern portfolio theory for the equilibrium structure of wages under conditions of uncertainty. The primary model presented is a model of wage uncertainty and hence the equilibrium structure is derived in terms of expected wages. The equilibrium structure with the assumption of a perfect labor market (e.g., labor units are infinitely divisible and costlessly mobile) and a perfect capital market is shown to have a very simple linear form. The model assumes homogeneous labor units as well as the usual single-period capital asset pricing model assumptions.

## 4. Tests of the multiperiod two-parameter model

### Abstract
Although investors face multiperiod decision problems, there are conditions under which the results of the one-period two-parameter model apply period by period. In addition to the assumptions made in the development of the two-parameter model itself (a perfect capital market, investor risk aversion, and normal distributions of one-period portfolio returns), the critical assumption in a multiperiod context is that, for any t, returns on portfolio assets from t−1 to t are independent of stochastic elements of the state-of-the-world at time t that affect investor tastes for given levels of wealth to be obtained at t.

## 5. Fallacy of the log-normal approximation to optimal portfolio decision-making over many periods
### Date
- May 1974
### Author
- Robert C. Merton
- Paul A. Samuelson
### Abstract
The fallacy that a many-period expected-utility maximizer should maximize (a) the expected logarithm of portfolio outcomes or (b) the expected average compound return of his portfolio is now understood to rest upon a fallacious use of the Law of Large Numbers. This paper exposes a more subtle fallacy based upon a fallacious use of the Central-Limit Theorem. While the properly normalized product of independent random variables does asymptotically approach a log-normal distribution under proper assumptions, it involves a fallacious manipulation of double limits to infer from this that a maximizer of expected utility after many periods will get a useful approximation to his optimal policy by calculating an efficiency frontier based upon (a) the expected log of wealth outcomes and its variance or (b) the expected average compound return and its variance. Expected utilities calculated from the surrogate log-normal function differ systematically from the correct expected utilities calculated from the true probability distribution. A new concept of ‘initial wealth equivalent’ provides a transitive ordering of portfolios that illuminates commonly held confusions. A non-fallacious application of the log-normal limit and its associated mean-variance efficiency frontier is established for a limit where any fixed horizon period is subdivided into ever more independent sub-intervals. Strong mutual-fund Separation Theorems are then shown to be asymptotically valid.

## 7. A negative report on the ‘near optimality’ of the max-expected-log policy as applied to bounded utilities for long lived programs
### Date
- May 1974
### Author
- M.Barry Goldman
### Abstract
Much controversy surrounds the use of the portfolio investment rules induced by maximizing the expected logarithm of terminal wealth (henceforth referred to as the MEL policy). It has been thought that the MEL policy is a good approximation to the optimal investment program when the utility of terminal wealth function is bounded and when the time horizon is long. However, I exhibit a class of bounded utility of terminal wealth functions for which the MEL policy is a very poor approximation to the optimal program. Hence, the wholesale use of the MEL policy as an approximation to the optimal program is unwarranted.
