## 2. The investment opportunity set and corporate financing, dividend, and compensation policies
### Date

### Abstract
We examine explanations for corporate financing-, dividend-, and compensation-policy choices. We document robust empirical relations among corporate policy decisions and various firm characteristics. Our evidence suggests contracting theories are more important in explaining cross-sectional variation in observed financial, dividend, and compensation policies than either tax-based or signaling theories.

## 3. Adverse selection and the rights offer paradox
### Date

### Abstract
We develop an analytical framework to explain firm's choice of equity flotation method and the near disappearance of rights offers by U.S. exchange-listed firms. The choice between uninsured rights, rights with standby underwriting, and firm-commitment underwriting depends on information asymmetries, shareholder characteristics, and direct flotation costs. Underwriter certification and current-shareholder takeup are viewed as substitute mechanisms for minimizing wealth transfers between shareholders and outside investors. Uninsured rights create adverse-selection effects when shareholder takeup is low. Implications for stock-price behavior around issue announcements, shareholder subscription precommitments, and relative issue frequencies are supported by large-sample evidence.

## 4. Multiple equilibria and term structure models
### Date
- Dec 1992
### Author
- Francis A. Longstaff
### Abstract
We show the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross term structure framework can allow a variety of alternative equilibrium solutions for discount bond prices. This is important since it allows us additional flexibility in developing models that capture the properties of the term structure. As an example, we solve for the value of a discount bond when the short-term rate is absorbed at zero. We compare the yields implied by this model to those implied by the original Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model. We also show that alternative equilibria can occur in other term structure models.

## 5. Corrections and additions to ‘a nonlinear equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates’
### Date
- Dec 1992
### Author
- David Beaglehole
- Mark Tenney
### Abstract
Longstaff (1989) introduces a new process for the short rate of interest. He claims to derive the zero-coupon bond pricing formula and state transition density for his model. We demonstrate that Longstaff's pricing formula is not the solution to the pricing problem which he poses. The source of his error is a failure to properly account for a boundary condition. We introduce a new model economy and derive a new endogenous interest rate process, and find the Green's function and the price of a zero-coupon bond for our model economy.

## 6. Research design issues in grouping-based tests
### Date
- Dec 1992
### Author
- Thomas Lys
- Jowell S. Sabino
### Abstract
With grouping, a sample is sorted by an observable variable and the mean values of the dependent variable in the extreme-ranked groups are compared. We show that test power is maximized when the two extreme groups each contain 27% of the sample, a much larger percentage than that typically used in the literature. This result is not sensitive to the distribution of the dependent variable. We also show that regression is unambiguously more powerful than grouping, even when the independent variable is measured with error.
