## 3. Convertible bonds as backdoor equity financing
### Date
- Aug 1992
### Author
- Jeremy C. Stein
### Abstract
This paper argues that corporations may use convertible bonds as an indirect way to get equity into their capital structures when adverse-selection problems make a conventional stock issue unattractive. Unlike other theories of convertible bond issuance, the model here highlights: 1) the importance of call provisions on convertibles and 2) the significance of costs of financial distress to the information content of a convertible issue.

## 4. The impact of institutional trading on stock prices

### Abstract
This paper uses new data on the holdings of 769 tax-exempt (predominantly pension) funds, to evaluate the potential effect of their trading on stock prices. We address two aspects of trading by these money managers: herding, which refers to buying (selling) simultaneously the same stocks as other managers buy (sell), and positive-feedback trading, which refers to buying past winners and selling past losers. These two aspects of trading are commonly a part of the argument that institutions destabilize stock prices. The evidence suggests that pension managers do not strongly pursue these potentially destabilizing practices.

## 5. Contagion and competitive intra-industry effects of bankruptcy announcements
### Date

### Abstract
This paper investigates the effect of bankruptcy announcements on the equity value of the bankrupt firm's competitors. On average, bankruptcy announcements decrease the value of a value-weighted portfolio of competitors by 1%. This negative effect is significantly larger for highly levered industries and industries where the unconditional stock returns of the nonbankrupt and bankrupt firms are highly correlated; the effect is significantly positive for highly concentrated industries with low leverage, suggesting that in such industries competitors benefit from the difficulties of the bankrupt firm.

## 6. What's special about the specialist?

### Abstract
Exchange members claim that the professional relationships that evolve on exchange floors yield benefits not easily duplicated by an anonymous exchange mechanism. We show that longstanding relationships between brokers and specialists can mitigate the effects of asymmetric information. Moreover, a specialist who actively attempts to differentiate between informed and uninformed traders can achieve equilibria that Pareto-dominate an equilibrium in which the two types of trades are pooled. Our model also elucidates the role of block trading houses in mitigating information problems in the block market.

## 7. Informational externalities of seasoned equity issues
### Date

### Abstract
We examine share-price reactions of commercial bank common stock issues and find negative effects on rival commercial and investment banking firms. In comparison, we find no such intra-industry effects for equity issues by industrial firms. Our results support theoretical models in which bank loan portfolios impound asymmetric information about client firms, so that adverse individual bank announcements generate external information effects on other banks. A policy implication of these results is that regulatory pressures applied to individual banks induce spillover costs for the commercial and investment banking industries. Our evidence also indicates that the legal separation of commercial and investment banking activities is artificial.

## 8. Managerial vote ownership and shareholder wealth
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
We examine employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) announcements to study the effects of an increase in managerial voting rights without a proportional increase in the ownership of cash flow claims. Our finding that when managers initially control few votes firm value increases with the fraction of shares contributed to the ESOP supports the view that managerial vote control serves shareholder interests. Conversely, the decrease in firm value with larger contributions to the ESOP when managers initially control many votes reflects a divergence of incentives that increases the agency problems between managers and outside shareholders.
