## 3. Option pricing
### Date
- Jan 1976
### Author
- Clifford W. Smith
### Abstract
Recent advances in the general equilibrium pricing of simple put and call options lay the foundation for the development of a general theory of the valuation of contingent claims assets. This paper provides a review of: (1) the development of the general equilibrium option pricing model by Black and Scholes, and the subsequent modifications of this model by Merton and others; (2) the empirical verification of these models; and (3) applications of these models to value other contingent claim assets such as the debt and equity of a levered firm and dual purpose mutual funds.

## 4. The option pricing model and the risk factor of stock

### Abstract
In this paper a combined capital asset pricing model and option pricing model is considered and then applied to the derivation of equity's value and its systematic risk. In the first section we develop the two models and present some newly found properties of the option pricing model. The second section is concerned with the effects of these properties on the securityholders of firms with less than perfect ‘me first’ rules. We show how unanticipated changes in firm capital and asset structures can differentially affect the firm's debt and equity. In the final section of the paper we consider a number of theoretical and empirical implications of the joint model. These include investment policy as well as the causes and effects of non-stationarity in the systematic risk of levered equity and risky debt.

## 5. A theoretical and empirical investigation of the dual purpose funds
### Date
- Jan 1976
### Author
- Jonathan E. Ingersoll
### Abstract
Using the option pricing methods developed by Black and Scholes as a general technique for contingent claims analysis, this paper examines a class of mutual funds known as Dual Purpose Funds. By constructing a simplified model for these funds under the ‘perfect hedge’ conditions of Black and Scholes, it is demonstrated that the asset value of the fund will always exceed the market value and that it is not inconsistent with market equilibrium or efficiency for the capital shares to sell at a discount. The simple model predicts price fluctuations in the seven dual funds studied quite well; however, there is a persistent downward bias in the predicted price level. Finally, refinements to the model are examined to determine the nature of the misspecification causing this bias.

## 6. Option pricing when underlying stock returns are discontinuous
### Date
- Jan 1976
### Author
- Robert C. Merton
### Abstract
The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities.

## 7. The valuation of options for alternative stochastic processes
### Date
- Jan 1976
### Author
- John C. Cox
- Stephen A. Ross
### Abstract
This paper examines the structure of option valuation problems and develops a new technique for their solution. It also introduces several jump and diffusion processes which have not been used in previous models. The technique is applied to these processes to find explicit option valuation formulas, and solutions to some previously unsolved problems involving the pricing of securities with payouts and potential bankruptcy.

## 8. The pricing of commodity contracts
### Date
- Jan 1976
### Author
- Fischer Black
### Abstract
The contract price on a forward contract stays fixed for the life of the contract, while a futures contract is rewritten every day. The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables.
