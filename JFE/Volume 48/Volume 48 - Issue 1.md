## 1. Wealth creation versus wealth redistributions in pure stock-for-stock mergers1

### Abstract
We examine wealth changes for all 1283 publicly traded debt and equity securities of firms involved in 260 pure stock-for-stock mergers from 1963 to 1996. We find no evidence that conglomerate stock-for-stock mergers create financial synergies or benefit bondholders at stockholders' expense. Instead, we document significant net synergistic gains in nonconglomerate mergers and generally insignificant net gains in conglomerate mergers. Conglomerate bidding-firm stockholders lose; all other securityholders at least break even. Convertible securityholders experience the largest gains, due mostly to their attached option values. Certain bond covenants are value-enhancing while leverage increases are value-reducing.

## 2. Larger board size and decreasing firm value in small firms1

### Abstract
Several studies hypothesize a relation between board size and financial performance. Empirical tests of the relation exist in only a few studies of large U.S. firms. We find a significant negative correlation between board size and profitability in a sample of small and midsize Finnish firms. Finding a board-size effect for a new and different class of firms affects the range of explanations for the board-size effect.

## 3. Information problems, conflicts of interest, and asset stripping:

### Abstract
Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy illustrates the devastating effect on firm value of court-sponsored asset stripping, i.e., the use of creditors' collateral to invest in high-variance negative net present value projects. During its bankruptcy, Eastern's value dropped over 50%. A substantial portion of this value decline occurred because an overprotective court insulated Eastern from market forces and allowed value-destroying operations to continue long after it was clear that Eastern should have been shut down. The failure of Eastern's Chapter 11 demonstrates the importance of having a bankruptcy process that protects a distressed firm's assets, not simply from a run by creditors, but also from overly optimistic managers and misguided judges.

## 4. Capital markets and corporate structure: the equity carve-outs of Thermo Electron1
### Date
- 1 April
### Authors
- Jeffrey W Allen
### Abstract
This paper examines the innovative corporate structure of Thermo Electron Corporation which holds controlling interests in 11 units taken public in equity carve-outs. Carve-outs subject units of the company to the scrutiny of the capital markets, allow the compensation contracts of unit managers to be based on market performance, and shift capital acquisition and investment decisions from centralized control to unit managers. Thermo carve-outs substantially increase capital and R&D expenditures following carve-outs and generate significant value from their capital investments. Since the first carve-out in 1983, gains to shareholders have been substantially greater than industry and market benchmarks.
