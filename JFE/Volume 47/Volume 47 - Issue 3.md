## 2. Venture capital and the structure of capital markets: banks versus stock markets1

### Abstract
The United States has many banks that are small relative to large corporations and play a limited role in corporate governance, and a well developed stock market with an associated market for corporate control. In contrast, Japanese and German banks are fewer in number but larger in relative size and are said to play a central governance role. Neither country has an active market for corporate control. We extend the debate on the relative efficiency of bank- and stock market-centered capital markets by developing a further systematic difference between the two systems: the greater vitality of venture capital in stock market-centered systems. Understanding the link between the stock market and the venture capital market requires understanding the contractual arrangements between entrepreneurs and venture capital providers; especially, the importance of the opportunity to enter into an implicit contract over control, which gives a successful entrepreneur the option to reacquire control from the venture capitalist by using an initial public offering as the means by which the venture capitalist exits from a portfolio investment. We also extend the literature on venture capital contracting by offering an explanation for two central characteristics of the U.S. venture capital market: relatively rapid exit by venture capital providers from investments in portfolio companies; and the common practice of exit through an initial public offering.

## 3. Proxy contests and corporate change: implications for shareholder wealth1

### Abstract
We study the shareholder wealth effects of 270 proxy contests for board seats in the 1979â€“1994 period. We find that proxy contests create value, with the bulk of the wealth gains stemming from firms that are acquired. Restricting analysis to firms listed on Compustat imparts a downward bias on estimated wealth effects because such a restriction excludes a sizable fraction of the firms acquired during the proxy contest. For firms that are not acquired, the occurrence of management turnover has a significant, positive effect on shareholder wealth because firms replacing management are more likely to restructure following the contest.

## 4. Macroeconomic news and bond market volatility1

### Abstract
We examine the reaction of daily Treasury bond prices to the release of U.S. macroeconomic news. These news releases (of employment and producer price index data) are of interest because they are released on periodic, preannounced dates and because they are associated with substantial bond market volatility. We investigate whether these nonautocorrelated announcements give rise to autocorrelated volatility. We find that announcement-day volatility does not persist at all, consistent with the immediate incorporation of information into prices. We also find a risk premium on these release dates.

## 5. Short-term traders and liquidity:

### Abstract
The abolition and reinstatement of the forward trading facility (Badla) on the Bombay Stock Exchange is used to study the effect of short-term traders on share prices and liquidity. The reactions of stock prices to the ban reveal an average negative abnormal return of 15% on Badla stocks as compared to the non-Badla stocks. The ensuing period shows a significant decline in the liquidity of the Badla Stocks related to the announcement period CARs. Our results suggest that the market perceives short-term traders as playing a significant positive role, with a larger benefit accruing to the relatively less-liquid stocks.
