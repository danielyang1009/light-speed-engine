## 3. Optimal capital structure under corporate and personal taxation
### Date

### Abstract
In this paper, a model of corporate leverage choice is formulated in which corporate and differential personal taxes exist and supply side adjustments by firms enter into the determination of equilibrium relative prices of debt and equity. The presence of corporate tax shield substitutes for debt such as accounting depreciation, depletion allowances, and investment tax credits is shown to imply a market equilibrium in which each firm has a unique interior optimum leverage decision (with or without leverage-related costs). The optimal leverage model yields a number of interesting predictions regarding cross-sectional and time-series properties of firms' capital structures. Extant evidence bearing on these predictions is examined.

## 4. Dealership market

### Abstract
This study considers the problem of a price-setting monopolistic market-maker in a dealership market where the stochastic demand and supply are depicted by price-dependent Poisson processes [following Garman (1976)]. The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the bid-ask prices on the market-maker's stock inventory position. We derive the optimal policy and its characteristics and compare it to Garman's. The results are shown to be consistent with some conjectures and observed phenomena, like the existence of a ‘preferred’ inventory position and the downward monotonicity of the bid-ask prices. For linear demand and supply functions we derive the behavior of the bid-ask spread and show that the transaction-to-transaction price behavior is intertemporally dependent. However, we prove that it is impossible to make a profit on this price dependence by trading against the market-maker. Thus, in this situation, serially dependent price-changes are consistent with the market efficiency hypothesis.

## 5. Stock returns and the weekend effect
### Date
- Mar 1980
### Author
- Kenneth R. French
### Abstract
This paper examines two alternative models of the process generating stock returns. Under the calendar time hypothesis, the process operates continuously and the expected return for Monday is three times the expected return for other days of the week. Under the trading time hypothesis, returns are generated only during active trading and the expected return is the same for each day of the week. During most of the period studied, from 1953 through 1977, the daily returns to the Standard and Poor's composite portfolio are inconsistent with both models. Although the average return for the other four days of the week was positive, the average for Monday was significantly negative during each of five-year subperiods.

## 6. Admissible uncertainty in the intertemporal asset pricing model
### Date
- Mar 1980
### Author
- George M. Constantinides
### Abstract
We embed the Sharpe-Lintner, two-parameter asset pricing theory in an intertemporal general equilibrium model. The investment opportunity set changes stochastically over time; in general the short-term and long-term interest rates and the distribution of the rate of return of the market portfolio are non-stationary. This non-stationarity, which is admissible in the Sharpe-Lintner model, has two implications: First, it may bias econometric methods which fail to explicitly take into account the non-stationarity. Second, the sequential application of the Sharpe-Lintner model in the discounting of stochastic cash flows becomes computationally complex and of little practical use.

## 7. The Mayers-Rice conjecture
### Date
- Mar 1980
### Author
- Robert E. Verrecchia
### Abstract
Mayers and Rice conjecture that an investor with better information will on average plot above the security market line as drawn by uninformed investors. This paper demonstrates that this conjecture is false in general, by constructing a counterexample. However, the Mayers-Rice conjecture is really part of a much broader hypothesis concerning whether increases in expected returns correspond to increases in expected utilities. It is shown that this latter hypothesis is true when the investor has an exponential or logarithmic utility function.
