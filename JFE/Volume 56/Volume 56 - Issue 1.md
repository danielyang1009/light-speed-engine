### Abstract
Traditionally and understandably, the microscope of market microstructure has focused on attributes of single assets. Little theoretical attention and virtually no empirical work has been devoted to common determinants of liquidity nor to their empirical manifestation, correlated movements in liquidity. But a wider-angle lens exposes an imposing image of commonality. Quoted spreads, quoted depth, and effective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After controlling for well-known individual liquidity determinants, such as volatility, volume, and price, common influences remain significant and material. Recognizing the existence of commonality is a key to uncovering some suggestive evidence that inventory risks and asymmetric information both affect intertemporal changes in liquidity.

## 2. Just another day in the inter-bank foreign exchange market
### Date

### Abstract
In this paper, I develop a theory of bid–ask quotes provided by foreign exchange dealers in the inter-bank market based on their beliefs and their inventory positions. I then build an agent-based model of the inter-dealer market where dealers learn in a Bayesian manner from quotes from other dealers. Using simulations, I find that the resulting intra-day spreads and between-quote returns largely conform to the empirically observed intra-day U-shaped pattern – a feature that has not been satisfactorily explained in the literature. I also study the factors that determine this U-shape.

## 3. The costs and determinants of order aggressiveness

### Abstract
This paper examines the costs and determinants of order aggressiveness. Aggressive orders have larger price impacts but smaller opportunity costs than passive orders. Price impacts are amplified by large orders, small firms, and volatile stock prices. To minimize the implementation shortfall, the optimal strategy is to enter buy (sell) orders at the bid (ask). Aggressive buy (sell) orders tend to follow other aggressive buy (sell) orders and occur when bid–ask spreads are narrow and depth on the same (opposite) side of the limit book is large (small). Aggressive buys are more likely than sells to be motivated by information.

## 4. The relative pricing of U.S. Treasury STRIPS: empirical evidence
### Date

### Abstract
We investigate pricing relations and the potential for arbitrage in the U.S. Treasury STRIPS market, stressing the importance of reconciling quoted Treasury data with actual market pricing conventions. We document that stripping and reconstitution profits in the STRIPS market are fleeting and rarely economically significant; that matched-maturity principal and coupon STRIPS generally have different prices due, at least in part, to richness or cheapness in the underlying note or bond; and that apparent negative forward rates in the STRIPS market are concentrated in certain long-maturity STRIPS that do not actually exist at the time.

## 5. Eighths, sixteenths, and market depth: changes in tick size and liquidity provision on the NYSE
### Date
- Apr 2000
### Author

### Abstract
Using limit order data provided by the NYSE, we investigate the impact of reducing the minimum tick size on the liquidity of the market. While both spreads and depths (quoted and on the limit order book) declined after the NYSE's change from eighths to sixteenths, depth declined throughout the entire limit order book as well. The combined effect of smaller spreads and reduced cumulative limit order book depth has made liquidity demanders trading small orders better off; however, traders who submitted larger orders in lower volume stocks did not benefit, especially if those stocks were low priced.
