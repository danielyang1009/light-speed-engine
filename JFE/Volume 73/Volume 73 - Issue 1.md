## 3. Does an electronic stock exchange need an upstairs market?

### Abstract
We examine the Paris Bourse, whose electronic limit order market closely resembles the downstairs markets envisioned by theorists, to test several theoretical predictions regarding upstairs trading. We present direct evidence in support of the Grossman (J. Business (1992) 509) prediction that upstairs brokers lower execution costs by tapping into unexpressed liquidity, as actual execution costs upstairs are on average only 20% (35%) as large as they would be if block trades were executed against displayed (displayed and hidden) liquidity in the downstairs limit order book. Consistent with prior analyses, the Paris data also support the Seppi (J. Finance (1990) 73) hypothesis that upstairs brokers certify trades as uninformed. We also find that participants in stocks with less restrictive crossing rules agree to outside-the-quote executions for more difficult trades and at times when downstairs liquidity is lacking. These likely represent trades that could not have been otherwise completed, suggesting that market quality can be enhanced by allowing participants more flexibility to execute blocks at prices outside the quotes.

## 4. Common market makers and commonality in liquidity

### Abstract
Each NYSE specialist firm provides liquidity for more than one common stock. As a result of shared capital and information among specialists within a firm, we argue that stock liquidity will co-move with the liquidity of other stocks handled by the same specialist firm, with magnitude increasing with the risk of providing liquidity. The evidence indicates that individual stock liquidity co-varies with specialist portfolio liquidity apart from information reflected by market liquidity variation. Further tests based on specialist firm size, specialist firm mergers, and market returns indicate that liquidity co-variation increases with the risk of providing liquidity.

## 5. Leverage decision and manager compensation with choice of effort and volatility

### Abstract
We study the incentive effects of granting levered or unlevered stock to a risk-averse manager. The stock is granted by risk-neutral shareholders who choose leverage and compensation level. The manager applies costly effort and selects the level of volatility, both of which affect expected return. The results are driven by the attempt of the risk-neutral shareholders to maximize the value of their claims net of the compensation package. We consider a dynamic setting and find that levered stock is optimal for high-type managers, firms with high momentum, large firms, and firms for which additional volatility only implies a modest increase in expected return.

## 6. Performance fee contract change and mutual fund risk
### Date

### Abstract
We examine the effect that an exogenously, specifically governmentally required change in compensation contract had on a managerial decision. We find that a group of mutual funds changed their portfolio risk levels after they were forced to change their performance fee schedules. Their portfolio risk choices differed predictably from a randomly selected group of nonperformance fee funds and a group of performance fee funds that were not required to change their compensation contracts. In addition, the affected mutual funds lost both shareholders and assets around the time of the imposition of the restriction while the other funds exhibited little change or gained assets and shareholders.

## 7. CEO compensation and incentives: Evidence from M&A bonuses
### Date
- Jun 2003
### Authors

### Abstract
We investigate CEO compensation for completing M&A deals. We find that CEOs who have more power to influence board decisions receive significantly larger bonuses. We also find a positive relation between bonus compensation and measures of effort, but not between bonus compensation and deal performance. CEOs with more power also tend to engage in larger deals relative to the size of their own firms, and the market responds more negatively to their acquisition announcements. Our evidence is consistent with the argument that managerial power is the primary driver of M&A bonuses.

## 8. The value of tax shields is NOT equal to the present value of tax shields
### Date
- Oct 2002
### Authors
- Pablo Fernandez
### Abstract
The value of tax shields is the difference between the present values of two different cash flows, each with their own risk: the present value of taxes for the unlevered company and the present value of taxes for the levered company. For constant growth companies, the value of tax shields in a world with no leverage cost is the present value of the debt, times the tax rate, times the unlevered cost of equity, discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. This result arises as the difference of two present values and does not mean that the appropriate discount for tax shields is the unlevered cost of equity.

## 9. The value of dividend imputation tax credits in Australia
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
A dividend imputation tax system provides shareholders with a credit (for corporate tax paid) that can be used to offset personal tax on dividend income. This paper shows how to infer the value of imputation tax credits from the prices of derivative securities that are unique to Australian retail markets. We also test whether a tax law amendment that was designed to prevent the trading of imputation credits affected their economic value. Before the amendment, tax credits were worth up to 50% of face value in large, high-yielding companies, but subsequently it is difficult to detect any value at all.
