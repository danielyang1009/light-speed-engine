## 2. Convertible debt issuance, capital structure change and financing-related information

### Abstract
This paper provides evidence on the valuation effects of convertible debt issuance. Common stockholders earn significant negative abnormal returns at the initial announcement of a convertible debt offering, and also at the issuance date. In contrast, the average valuation effect on common stock at the announcement of non-convertible debt offerings is only marginally negative, and is zero at issuance. The significant negative average effect on common stock value appears not to be systematically related to either the degree of leverage change induced by the convertible debt issuance or the extent to which the proceeds from issuance are used for new investment or to refinance existing debt. If, as appears likely, the issuance of convertible debt on average increases financial leverage, these results are inconsistent with evidence from other recent studies documenting common stock price effects of the same sign as the change in leverage. The evidence suggests that convertible debt offerings convey unfavorable information about the issuing firms, but the specific nature of such information remains unidentified.

## 3. Corporate financing and investment decisions when firms have information that investors do not have

### Abstract
This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity. Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.

## 4. The intraday speed of adjustment of stock prices to earnings and dividend announcements

### Abstract
This paper examines the effects of Broad Tape news releases of earnings and dividend announcements on three aspects of intraday stock price behavior: mean returns, return variance, and serial correlation in consecutive price changes. The initial price reaction is evident in the first pair of price changes following the release (i.e., within a few minutes, at most). The returns earned by simple trading rules dissipate within five to ten minutes, although significant returns are detected in the overnight period and at the opening of trading on the next day. Disturbances in the variance and serial correlation persist for several hours and extend into the following trading day. As a class, dividend announcements induce much less activity than do earnings, although the response to dividend changes is comparable to the earnings announcement effect.

## 5. Explaining investor preference for cash dividends

### Abstract
The well-known tendency of investors to favor cash dividends emerges quite naturally in two new theories of choice behavior [the theory of self-control due to Thaler and Shefrin (1981), and the version of prospect theory set out by Kahneman and Tversky (1979)]. Although our treatment is novel when viewed from the perspective of standard financial theory, it provides explanations for a phenomenon that has long been described as perplexing.

## 6. Differential information and the small firm effect

### Abstract
We examine a model of market equilibrium in which there is less information available about some of the securities in the market than about others. We consider the model as a potential explanation of the well-known small firm anomaly. Using period of listing as a proxy for quantity of information, we find an association between period of listing and security returns that cannot be accounted for by firm size and which is not diminished by an elimination of January returns data from our sample. Thus, we observe a new empirical regularity in the data and refer to the regularity as the ‘period of listing’ effect.
