## 3. Returns to contrarian investment strategies: Tests of naive expectations hypotheses
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
This paper examines the ability of naive investor expectations models to explain the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies. Contrary to Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), we find no systematic evidence that stock prices reflect naive extrapolation of past trends in earnings and sales growth. Building on Bauman and Dowen (1988) and La Porta (1995), however, we find that stock prices appear to naively reflect analysts' biased forecasts of future earnings growth. Further, we find that naive reliance on analysts' forecasts of future earnings growth can explain over half of the higher returns to contrarian investment strategies.

## 4. Emerging equity market volatility

### Abstract
Understanding volatility in emerging capital markets is important for determining the cost of capital and for evaluating direct investment and asset allocation decisions. We provide an approach that allows the relative importance of world and local information to change through time in both the expected returns and conditional variance processes. Our time-series and cross-sectional models analyze the reasons that volatility is different across emerging markets, particularly with respect to the timing of capital market reforms. We find that capital market liberalizations often increase the correlation between local market returns and the world market but do not drive up local market volatility.

## 5. The complexity of compensation contracts
### Date
- Jan 1997
### Authors
- Stacey R. Kole
### Abstract
Management compensation is often categorized as either sensitive or insensitive to firm performance. This one-dimensional treatment ignores the variation in the types and terms of compensation contracts. Through a cross-sectional examination of share-holder-authorized compensation arrangements, this paper demonstrates that the terms of stock option and restricted stock plans, and the flexibility afforded the board of directions in negotiating with managers, vary systematically with the characteristics of the assets being managed. This variation in compensation contracting challenges theorists to incorporate the richness of management contracts into models of incentive pay.

## 6. Layoffs and underwritten rights offers
### Date
- Jan 1997
### Authors
- Ajai K. Singh
### Abstract
In seasoned equity rights offers, the standby underwriting contract resembles the sale of a put option. In the rights offering period, underwriters reduce their exposure to the standby underwriting by purchasing rights hedged with short sale of the common stock. Consistent with Eckbo and Masulis (1992), offers with large rights sell-offs during the offering period experience significant price decline. The offering period price decline and the nature of constraints confronting underwriters may partially explain the preference for general public offers.

## 7. The effects of equity issues on ownership structure and stock liquidity: A comparison of rights and public offerings
### Date
- Jan 1997
### Authors
- Meeta Kothare
### Abstract
I find that proportionate bid ask spreads increase after rights offerings of common stock, but decrease after public underwritten offerings. These changes are correlated with changes in the issuing firm's ownership structure. Public offerings cause greater dispersion in share ownership while rights offerings lead to more concentrated ownership. I argue that increased spreads represent a significant cost to issuing firms shareholders, making rights offerings costlier than public underwritten offerings for actively traded firms.
