## 2. Industry costs of equity
### Date
- Feb 1997
### Author
- Eugene F. Fama
- Kenneth R. French
### Abstract
Estimates of the cost of equity for industries are imprecise. Standard errors of more than 3.0% per year are typical for both the CAPM and the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993). These large standard errors are the result of(i) uncertainty about true factor risk premiums and (ii) imp ecise estimates of the loadings of industries on the risk factors. Estimates of the cost of equity for firms and projects are surely even less precise.

## 3. Do independent directors enhance target shareholder wealth during tender offers?

### Abstract
We examine the role of the target firm's independent outside directors during takeover attempts by tender offer. We find that when the target's board is independent, the initial tender offer premium, the bid premium revision, and the target shareholder gains over the entire tender offer period are higher, and that the presence of a poison pill and takeover resistance lead to greater premiums and shareholder gains. We conclude that independent outside directors enhance target shareholder gains from tender offers, and that boards with a majority of independent directors are more likely to use resistance strategies to enhance shareholder wealth.

## 4. Information and contagion effects of bank loan-loss reserve announcements
### Date

### Abstract
Consistent with an information-signaling perspective, negative and statistically significant announcement effects are associated with bank loan-loss reserve (LLR) announcements over the 1985–1990 period. Announcement effects differ between money-center and regional banks and also according to the nature of contemporaneous earnings and dividend disclosures. Moreover Information transfer or ‘contagion’ effects are present in that LLR announcements by regional banks decrease the value of both money-center banks and nonannouncing regional banks. These statistically significant contagion effects suggest a link between the asset quality characteristics of money-center and regional bank loan portfolios.

## 5. Spinoffs and wealth transfers: The Marriott case
### Date
- Feb 1997
### Author
- Robert Parrino
### Abstract
This paper examines changes in bondholder and shareholder wealth resulting from the 1993 Marriott spinoff. It documents a wealth transfer from bondholders to shareholders and a decline in the total value of the firm following the spinoff announcement. Subsequent modifications to the spinoff plan reduced the bondholders' loss, but the value of Marriott's notes and debentures remained $194.6 million below their pre-announcement level on the distribution date. Industry-adjusted shareholder gains during the same period were only $80.6 million. Transaction costs and inefficiencies resulting from the spinoff explain much of the decline in the total value of the firm.

## 6. Privatization and efficiency: Industry effects of the sale of British Airways
### Date

### Abstract
We analyze the effect of privatization on the performance of British Airways by examining the privatization's impact on airfares and competitors' stock prices. We find that stock prices of U.S. competitors fell a significant 7% upon British Airways' privatization, implying expectation of a more competitive British Airways. Closer rivals of British Airways experienced a greater drop in stock price than more distant rivals. Further, airfares in markets served by British Airways fell significantly upon privatization. The results suggest that a change from government to private ownership improves economic efficiency.
