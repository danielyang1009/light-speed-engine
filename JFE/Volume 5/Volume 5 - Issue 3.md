## 2. Alternative methods for raising capital
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- Clifford W. Smith
### Abstract
This paper provides an analysis of the choice of method for raising additional equity capital by listed firms. Examination of expenses reported to the SEC indicates that rights offerings involve significantly lower costs; yet underwriter are employed in over 90 percent of the offerings. The underwriting industry, finance textbooks, and corporate proxy statements offer several justifications for the use of underwriters. However, estimates of the magnitudes of these arguments indicate that they are insufficient to justify the additional costs of the use of underwriters. The use of underwriters thus appears to be inconsistent with rational, wealth-maximizing behavior by the owners of the firm. The paper concludes with an examination of alternate explanations of the observed choice of financing method.

## 3. Estimating betas from nonsynchronous data
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- Myron Scholes
- Joseph Williams
### Abstract
Nonsynchronous trading of securities introduces into the market model a potentially serious econometric problem of errors in variables. In this paper properties of the observed market model and associated ordinary least squares estimators are developed in detail. In addition, computationally convenient, consistent estimators for parameters of the market model are calculated and then applied to daily returns of securities listed in the NYSE and ASE.

## 4. The effect of a rating change announcement on bond price
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- Mark I. Weinstein
### Abstract
This paper examines the behavior of corporate bond prices during the period surrounding the announcement of a rating change. We find some evidence of price change during the period from 18 to 7 months before the rating change is announced. We find no evidence of any reaction during the 6 months prior to the rating change. We also find little reaction, if any, during the month of the change or for 6 months after the change. This evidence contradicts the recent findings of Katz and Grier and Katz.

## 5. Tender offers and stockholder returns
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- Peter Dodd
- Richard Ruback
### Abstract
This paper provides empirical estimates of the stock market reaction to tender offers, both successful and unsuccessful. The impact of the tender offer on the returns to stockholders of both bidding and target firms is examined. The evidence indicates that for the twelve months prior to the tender offer stockholders of bidding firms earn significant positive abnormal returns. In the month of the offer, only successful bidders earn significant positive abnormal returns. Stockholders of both successful and unsuccessful targe firms earn large positive abnormal returns from tender offers, and most of these returns occur in the month of the offer. For all classes of firms, there is no significant post-offer market reaction. The market reaction to ‘clean-up’ tender offers is also estimated and target stockholders again earn significant positive abnormal returns.

## 6. The impact of variance estimation in option valuation models
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- Phelim P. Boyle
- A.L. Ananthanarayanan
### Abstract
This paper examines some implications of using an estimate of the variance in option valuation models. This procedure produces biased option values. It is shown that the magnitude of this bias is not large. The dispersion induced in the option price is more significant particularly for parameter values of practical interest. The nature and extent of this dispersion is examined by numerical examples. The paper suggests how a Bayesian approach could be used to cope with the estimation error.

## 7. An autoregressive jump process for common stock returns
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- George S. Oldfield
- Richard J. Rogalski
- Robert A. Jarrow
### Abstract
This paper develops a new distribution theory for common stock returns. The model is composed of a calendar time diffusion process and a jump process where the magnitudes of the jumps may be autocorrelated. Empirical tests are performed on a month of transactions returns for twenty New York Stock Exchange securities. The data analysis supports the validity of the proposed theory.

## 8. Taxes, transactions costs and the clientele effect of dividends
### Date
- Dec 1977
### Authors
- R.Richardson Pettit
### Abstract
This paper is an empirical investigation into the extent to which transactions costs and taxes influence individual investors' portfolios. Using actual portfolio and demoraphic data made available by the Individual Investor Research Project at Purdue University, this study finds evidence of a significant dividend clientele effect. Reasonable proxy variables used to measure time preferences and tax rates in part explain the cross sectional variability of investors' portfolio dividend yields. The variables that are most important in influencing the individual's dividend decision are age, and a measure of the investor's differential tax rate on dividends and capital gains.
