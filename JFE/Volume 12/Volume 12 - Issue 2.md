## 2. Transactions data tests of efficiency of the Chicago board options exchange
### Date
- Aug 1983
### Author
- Mihir Bhattacharya
### Abstract
This paper performs lower boundary condition tests based on rational pricing of call options and an implied standard deviation test based on the bid/ask prices of options. These efficiency tests attempt to closely approximate conditions in the option markets to avoid the pitfalls indicated by Phillips and Smith (1980). The tests use transactions data and account for the effects of stock and option bid/ask prices, simultaneity of stock and option prices, depth of market, execution lag and transaction costs. The small and relatively infrequent profits due to market mispricing disappear in the lower boundary tests when transaction costs are taken into account. Frequent violations of the tighter boundary conditions in the implied standard deviation test are reported, but the estimated profits cannot be unambiguously attributed to option market inefficiency.

## 3. Shareholder wealth, information signaling and the specially designated dividend
### Date
- Aug 1983
### Author
- James A. Brickley
### Abstract
This paper examines common stock returns and dividend and earnings patterns surrounding specially designated dividends labeled by management as ‘extra’, ‘special’ or ‘year-end’ and compares them to those surrounding regular (unlabeled) dividend increases. The results support the notion that management uses the labeling of dividend increases to convey information to the market about the future potential of the firm. Unlabeled increases appear to contain the most positive information. Contrary to the sometimes suggested view, specially designated dividends appear to convey positive information about future dividends and earnings beyond that relating to the current period.

## 4. Warrant valuation and exercise strategy
### Date
- Aug 1983
### Author
- David C. Emanuel
### Abstract
This paper demonstrates that warrant valuation and exercise strategy differ fundamentally from call option valuation. Simultaneous exercise of warrants is shown to be suboptimal and a monopolist owning all warrants can achieve a higher value. Unless warrants are perfectly divisible, no satisfactory equilibrium exists for the valuation and exercise of widely held warrants. The problems encountered appear to be quite general and stem from necessary assumptions about future corporate dividend policy and capital structure. Such assumptions are necessary for any model of corporate security valuation.

## 5. Valuation of asset leasing contracts
### Date
- Aug 1983
### Author
- John J. McConnell
- James S. Schallheim
### Abstract
This paper describes the relation among a variety of asset leasing contracts, including: (1) cancellable operating leases; (2) leases which grant the lesse an option to extend the life of the lease; (3) leases that grant the lessee an option to purchase the leased asset at a fixed price at the maturity date of the lease; (4) leases that grant the lessee the right to purchase the leased asset at its ‘fair market value’ at the maturity date of the lease; (5) leases that grant an option to the lessee to purchase the leased asset at a prespecified price anytime during the life of the lease; (6) leases that require the lessee to purchase the leased asset at a fixed price at the maturity date of the lease; and (7) leases that contain non-cancellation provisions. The paper uses a compound option pricing framework to develop a general model for valuing (or evaluating) each of the types of leasing contracts. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the various elements of a leasing contract — including cancellation risk and residual value risk — on equilibrium rental payments.

## 6. Friction in the trading process and the estimation of systematic risk

### Abstract
This paper considers how estimates of the market model beta parameter can be biased by friction in the trading process (information, decision, and transaction costs) that (a) leads to a distinction between observed and ‘true’ returns; (b) causes observed returns to be generated asynchronously for a set of interdependent securities; and (c) thereby introduces serial cross-correlation into security returns. Several propositions are derived from which consistent estimators of beta are obtained, and the effect of differencing interval length on beta estimates is specified. The formulation is contrasted with the related analyses of Scholes-Williams (1977) and Dimson (1979).

## 7. Risk measurement when shares are subject to infrequent trading
### Date

### Author

- C.Harvey Rorke
### Abstract
When securities are thinly traded OLS techniques yield biased beta estimates. Procedures for calculating consistent estimates are proposed by Scholes and Williams (1977) and by Dimson (1979). This comment examines both procedures and concludes that the Dimson procedure is incorrect and cannot generally be expected to yield consistent beta estimates. However, a variant of this procedure can yield results which are identical to Scholes and Williams' and is, therefore, correct.

## 8. Option pricing in a lognormal securities market with discrete trading
### Date
- Aug 1983
### Author
- David Brown
- Chi-fu Huang
### Abstract
In a recent paper Lee et al. derive a pricing formula which is significantly different from that of Black and Scholes. Their derivation is inconsistent due to their failure to recognize that the rate of return of an option written on an asset whose rate of return is lognormally distributed will not be lognormally distributed.
