## 2. Banking integration and house price co-movement

### Abstract
The correlation in house price growth across US states increased steadily between 1976 and 2000. This paper shows that the contemporaneous geographic integration of the US banking market, via the emergence of large banks, was a primary driver of this phenomenon. To this end, we first theoretically derive an appropriate measure of banking integration across state pairs and show that house price growth correlation is strongly related to this measure of financial integration. Our instrumental variable estimates suggest that banking integration can explain up to one-fourth of the rise in house price correlation over this period.

## 3. Information networks: Evidence from illegal insider trading tips
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
This paper exploits a novel hand-collected data set to provide a comprehensive analysis of the social relationships that underlie illegal insider trading networks. I find that inside information flows through strong social ties based on family, friends, and geographic proximity. On average, inside tips originate from corporate executives and reach buy-side investors after three links in the network. Inside traders earn prodigious returns of 35% over 21 days, with more central traders earning greater returns, as information conveyed through social networks improves price efficiency. More broadly, this paper provides some of the only direct evidence of person-to-person communication among investors.

## 4. CEO talent, CEO compensation, and product market competition

### Abstract
We develop a structural industry equilibrium model to show how competitive chief executive officer (CEO)-firm matching and product markets jointly determine firm value and CEO pay. We analytically derive testable implications for the effects of product market characteristics on firm size, CEO pay, and CEO impact on firm value. CEO talent matters more in more competitive markets with greater product substitutabilities. Our CEO impact estimates are much higher than those obtained by previous structural approaches that abstract away from CEO market segmentation. The estimates differ across industries primarily due to variation in product market competition, rather than variation in the CEO talent distribution.

## 5. Explaining the negative returns to volatility claims: An equilibrium approach
### Date

### Abstract
We study the returns to investing in VIX futures, VIX Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and variance swaps. We document substantial negative return premia for these assets. For example, the constant maturity portfolio of 1-month VIX futures loses about 30% per year over our sample period (2006–2013). We investigate if these findings are consistent with dynamic equilibrium. We derive a model based on present value computation that endogenizes stock prices, the VIX index, and its associated derivative contracts. The model explains the negative return premia as well as several other stylized features of the VIX futures, ETNs, and variance swap data.

## 6. The bright side of financial derivatives: Options trading and firm innovation
### Date

### Abstract
Do financial derivatives enhance or impede innovation? We answer this question by examining the relationship between equity options markets and standard measures of firm innovation. We find that firms with more options trading activity generate more patents and patent citations per dollar invested in research and development (R&D), after accounting for other confounding factors. These results are confirmed when we use a propensity score matching procedure and an instrumental variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of options trading. The evidence is consistent with the notion that the enhanced informational efficiency induced by options leads to an improved allocation of corporate resources. We further discuss possible underlying economic mechanisms through which more active options markets boost innovation and show that the effect remains substantial even after controlling for these mechanisms. Considering the average increase in the dollar volume of options traded for our sample firms, we conclude that a 200% move in options volume increases firm innovation by about 31%.

## 7. Board reforms and firm value: Worldwide evidence

### Abstract
We examine the impact of corporate board reforms on firm value in 41 countries. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that board reforms increase firm value. Reforms involving board and audit committee independence, but not reforms involving separation of chairman and chief executive officer positions, drive the valuation increases. In addition, while comply-or-explain reforms result in a greater increase in firm value than rule-based reforms, the effects of reforms are similar across civil law and common law countries. Further investigation shows that the subsequent change in board independence plays an important role in explaining the effectiveness of the reforms.

## 8. What do measures of real-time corporate sales say about earnings surprises and post-announcement returns?

### Abstract
We develop real-time proxies of retail corporate sales from multiple sources, including ∼50 million mobile devices. These measures contain information from both the earnings quarter (“within quarter”) and the period between the quarter-end and the earnings announcement date (“post quarter”). Our within-quarter measure is powerful in explaining quarterly sales growth, revenue surprises, and earnings surprises, generating average excess announcement returns of 3.4%. However, our post-quarter measure is related negatively to announcement returns and positively to post-announcement returns. When post-quarter private information is positive, managers, at announcement, provide pessimistic guidance and use negative language. This effect is more pronounced when, post-announcement, management insiders trade. We conclude that managers do not fully disclose their private information and instead bias their disclosures down when in possession of positive private information. The data suggest that they could be motivated in part by subsequent personal stock-trading opportunities.

## 9. The advantages of using excess returns to model the term structure
### Date

### Abstract
We advocate the use of excess returns rather than yields or log prices in analysing the risk neutral dynamics of the term structure. We show that under standard assumptions, excess returns are affine in the risk neutral innovations in the factors. This framework has several important advantages. First, it allows for an easy estimation of models that are more flexible than the AR(1). Indeed, we estimate models with more general dynamics, like ARFIMA(p, d, q), almost as easily as AR(1). Second, within our framework the dimension of the unrestricted model is the same for the AR(1) as it is for the richer models, and does not expand in line with the state vector as it does in a yield or log price framework. This makes it appropriate to test all of these risk neutral dynamic specifications against the same OLS unrestricted alternative. Our results for the US Treasury bond market show that the unrestricted model is preferred to the AR(1) by the Bayesian Information Criterion, but the opposite conclusion is reached for more flexible models. A final advantage of the excess returns framework is that the pricing errors are much lower than for the equivalent log price system.

## 10. Tracing out capital flows: How financially integrated banks respond to natural disasters
### Date

### Abstract
Multi-market banks reallocate capital when local credit demand increases after natural disasters. Using property damage as an instrument for lending growth, we find credit in unaffected but connected markets declines by a little less than 50 cents per dollar of additional lending in shocked areas. However, banks shield their core markets because most of the decline comes from loans in areas where banks do not own branches. Moreover, banks increase sales of more-liquid loans and they bid up the rate on deposits in the connected markets. These actions help lessen the impact of the demand shock on credit supply.

## 11. Endogenous intermediation in over-the-counter markets
### Date

### Abstract
We provide a theory of trading through intermediaries in over-the-counter markets. The role of intermediaries is to sustain trade. In our model, traders are connected through an informational network. Agents observe their neighbors’ actions and can trade with their counterparty in a given period through a path of intermediaries in the network. Nevertheless, agents can renege on their obligations. We show that trading through an informational network is essential to support trade when agents infrequently meet the same counteparty. However, intermediaries must receive fees to implement trades. Concentrated intermediation, as represented by a star network, is both constrained efficient and stable when agents incur linking costs. The center agent in a star can receive higher fees as well.
