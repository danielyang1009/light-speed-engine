## 2. Unanticipated inflation and the value of the firm
### Date
- Mar 1986
### Author
- Victor L. Bernard
### Abstract
Evidence presented here indicates that the relationship between stock returns and unexpected inflation differs systematically across firms. The differences are shown to be consistent with cross-sectional variation in firms' nominal contracts (monetary claims and depreciation tax shields). The differences are also partially explained by proxies for underlying firm characteristics that could create interaction between unexpected inflation and operating profitability. Finally, much if not most of the differences appear to arise because unexpected inflation is correlated with changes in expected aggregate real activity, the effects of which tend to vary across firms according to their systematic risk.

## 3. Calculating the market value of riskless cash flows
### Date
- Mar 1986
### Author
- Richard S. Ruback
### Abstract
This paper uses arbitrage arguments to calculate the market value of riskless after-tax cash flows. The market value equals the present value of riskless after-tax cash flows discounted at the after-corporate-tax riskless interest rate. The market value equals the adjusted present value of riskless after-tax cash flows only when the incremental debt used in the adjusted present value calculations equals the market value of the remaining after-tax cash flows. Also, the analysis provides valuation formulas when interest and tax rates are certain but not uniform and when interest rates are uncertain.

## 4. Unbiased estimation of the Black/Scholes formula
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
The Black/Scholes model gives the price of an option as a function of the true variance rate of the underlying stock and other parameters. Because the true variance rate is unobservable, an estimate of the variance rate is used in empirical tests. But, because the Black/Scholes formula is non-linear in the variance, option price estimates using an estimated variance are biased, even if the variance estimate itself is unbiased. This paper develops an unbiased estimator of the Black/Scholes formula from a Taylor series expansion of the formula and the properties of the pdf of the estimated variance.

## 5. Non-trading, market making, and estimates of stock price volatility
### Date
- Mar 1986
### Author
- Terry A. Marsh
- Eric R. Rosenfeld
### Abstract
We examine the effects of market making and intermittent trading on estimates of stock price volatility. When observed price changes are correctly tied to a stock's true price dynamics, it is found that non-trading per se causes a loss of efficiency but no bias in traditional volatility estimates. Non-trading induces substancial inefficiency in the extreme value estimator of volatility which it biases downward. Market making's effects add to the non-trading induced inefficiency in the traditional estimator, while information trading causes a downward bias, and liquidity trading a potentially removable upward bias, in that estimator.

## 6. Performance measurement with the arbitrage pricing theory
### Date
- Mar 1986
### Author
- Gregory Connor
- Robert A. Korajczyk
### Abstract
This paper develops a theory and econometric method of portfolio performance measurement using a competitive equilibrium version of the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. We show that the Jensen coefficient and the appraisal ratio of Treynor and Black are theoretically compatible with the Arbitrage Pricing Theory. We construct estimators for the two performance measures using a new principal components technique, and describe their asymptotic distributions. The estimators are computationally feasible using a large number of securities. We also suggest a new approach to testing for the correct number of factors.

## 7. The market valuation of cash dividends
### Date
- Mar 1986
### Author
- James M Poterba
### Abstract
This paper re-examines the case of Citizens Utilities, a firm with one class of common stock which pays stock dividends and one which pays taxable cash dividends. John Long's (1978) study of the two shares' relative prices suggests that investors may prefer cash dividends to equal-sized stock dividends. This paper finds that the cash dividend share's ex-day price decline is less than their dividend payment. Stock dividend shares fall by nearly their full dividend. The disparity between ex-day dividend valuation and the observed prices of the two shares is inconsistent with some explanations of the demand for cash dividends.
