## 2. Book-to-market, dividend yield, and expected market returns: A time-series analysis

### Abstract
We find reliable evidence that both book-to-market (B M) and dividend yield track time-series variation in expected real stock returns over the period 1926 91 (in which B M is stronger) and the subperiod 1941–1991 (in which dividend yield is stronger). A Bayesian bootstrap procedure implies that an investor with prior belief 0.5 that expected returns on the equal-weighted index are never negative comes away from the full-period B/M evidence with posterior probability 0.08 for the hypothesis (0.14 with the impact of the 1933 outlier tempered). Although this raises doubts about market efficiency, the post-1940 evidence is consistent with expected returns always being positive.

## 3. The decline of takeovers and disciplinary managerial turnover

### Abstract
We compare top management turnover in unacquired U.S. industrial companies during an active takeover market (1984–1988) and a less active takeover market (1989–1993). For firms in the lowest quartile of performance (measured by operating income scaled by assets). 33% experience complete turnover of the president, CEO, and board chair during the active takeover period and only 17% experience complete turnover during the less active period. Controlling for various determinants of management turnover, we provide evidence that turnover and performance are related only in the active takeover period, and conclude that takeover activity affects the intensity of managerial discipline.

## 4. Inside directors, board effectiveness, and shareholder wealth

### Abstract
We investigate whether inside managers are added to corporate boards for efficiency or entrenchment purposes. Our examination of inside director appointments finds that the stock-market reaction to the announcement is significantly negative when inside directors own less than 5% of the firm's common stock, significantly positive when their ownership level is between 5% and 25%, and insignificantly different from zero when ownership exceeds 25%. These results suggest that the expected benefits of an inside director's expert knowledge clearly out weigh the expected costs of managerial entrenchment only when managerial and outside shareholder interests are closely aligned.

## 5. An empirical examination of basic valuation models for plain vanilla U.S. interest rate swaps
### Date
- May 1997
### Author
- Bernadette A. Minton
### Abstract
This paper examines empirical implications of recently developed models for pricing contracts that swap fixed- for variable-rate interest payment streams. Valuation models based on replicating portfolios of consecutive three-month Eurodollar futures contracts that span the life of the swap perform relatively well, as do pricing models based on replicating portfolios of noncallable corporate par bonds. Neither set of models, however, is completely empirically consistent with the implications of differential counterparty risks. These anomalous results call into question the appropriateness of either the simplifying assumptions of the arbitrage-based models or the proxies used for counter-party default risk.
