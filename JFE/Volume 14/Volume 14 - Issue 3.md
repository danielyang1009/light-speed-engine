## 2. Multivariate tests of the zero-beta CAPM
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- Jay Shanken
### Abstract
A ‘cross-sectional regression test’ (CSRT) of the CAPM is developed and its connection to the Hotelling T2 test of multivariate statistical analysis is explored. Algebraic relations between the CSRT, the likehood ratio test and the Langrange multiplier test are derived and a useful small-sample bound on the distribution function of the CSRT is obtained. An application of the CSRT suggests that the CRSP equally-weighted index is inefficient, but that the inefficiency is not explained by a firm size-effect from February to December.

## 3. A note on the geometry of Shanken's CSR T2 test for mean/variance efficiency
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- Richard Roll
### Abstract
Shanken (1985) derives a test for the zero-beta capital asset pricing model (CAPM) which, as he points out, is equivalent to a test of the mean/variance efficiency of the market portfolio. This note illustrates the geometry of Shanken's test in the mean/variance space.

## 4. A Monte Carlo investigation of the accuracy of multivariate CAPM tests
### Date

### Author

### Abstract
In a multivariate regression model relating individual returns to the market return, CAPM implies non-linear restrictions on the parameters. Several asymptotically valid tests of these restrictions have been suggested. The existing Monte Carlo evidence shows that some of these tests are unreliable for reasonable sample sizes, but does not indicate well which tests are reliable. This paper reports the results of an extensive Monte Carlo experiment. Shanken's CSR test and Jobson and Korkie's corrected likelihood ratio test are quite accurate in all cases we consider.

## 5. Underpricing of seasoned issues
### Date

### Author
- John E. Parsons
- Artur Raviv
### Abstract
In this paper we provide a model of the underwritten offerings of new shares of seasoned securities. Our purpose is to explain why the offering price chosen by the underwriter is lower than the market price of the firm's shares. Our model recognizes the interdependence between the markets surrounding the announcement and sale of the new issue and recognizes as well the effect which asymmetric information regarding investor demands has upon the prices in these markets.

## 6. Corporate capital expenditure decisions and the market value of the firm
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- John J. McConnell
- Chris J. Muscarella
### Abstract
This paper is an ‘event-time’ study of the common stock prices of a sample of 658 corporations around the dates on which they publicly announced their future capital expenditure plans. For industrial firms, announcements of increases (decreases) in planned capital expenditures are associated with significant positive (negative) excess stock returns. For public utility firm, neither increases nor decreases in planned capital expenditures are associated with significant excess stock returns. We interpret the evidence as being consistent with the hypothesis that managers seek to maximize the market value of the firm in making their corporate capital expenditure decisions.

## 7. Predictable events and excess returns: The case of dividend announcements
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- Avner Kalay
- Uri Loewenstein
### Abstract
This paper hypothesizes that the risk per unit of time and the required rate of return are higher than normal during an event period whose timing can be predicted. Consistent with this hypothesis this paper presents empirical evidence indicating that the unconditional mean rate of return, the variance of stock returns and their systematic risk are higher than ‘usual’ during dividend announcement periods. However, the documented increases in the systematic risk are not large enough to fully explain the ‘excess returns’. This finding is puzzling and hard to reconcile with existing theory.

## 8. An exploratory investigation of the firm size effect
### Date

### Author

- David A. Hsieh
### Abstract
We investigate the firm size effect for the period 1958 to 1977 in the framework of a multi-factor pricing model. The risk-adjusted difference in returns between the top five percent and the bottom five percent of the NYSE firms is about one to two percent a year, a drop from about twelve percent per year before risk adjustment. The variable most responsible for the adjustment is the sensitivity of asset returns to the changing risk premium, measured by the return difference between low-grade bonds and long-term government bonds.

## 9. Dividend yields and stock returns: Implications of abnormal January returns
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- Donald B. Keim
### Abstract
This study examines the empirical relation between stock returns and (long-run) dividend yields. The findings show that much of the phenomenon is due to a nonlinear relation between dividend yields and returns in January. Regression coefficients on dividend yields, which some models predict should be non-zero due to differential taxation of dividends and capital gains, exhibit a significant January seasonal, even when controlling for size. This finding is significant since there are no provisions in the after-tax asset pricing models that predict the tax differential is more important in January than in other months.

## 10. Derived factors in event studies
### Date
- Sep 1985
### Author
- Stephen J. Brown
- Mark I. Weinstein
### Abstract
We examine the utility of the statistical factor model of the process generating stock returns in the context of event studies. For a variety of estimation procedures and experimental designs we find limited value added relative to the use of a simple market model. We would attribute this finding to misspecification of the statistical factor analysis model, and suspect that there exist more robust procedures for estimating the factor structure of stock returns.
