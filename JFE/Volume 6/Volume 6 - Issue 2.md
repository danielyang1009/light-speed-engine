## 3. Anomalies in relationships between securities' yields and yield-surrogates
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- Ray Ball
### Abstract
A literature survey reveals consistent excess returns after public announcements of firms' earnings. If the information in publicly-announced earnings is a public good, then these results seem inconsistent with equilibrium in the securities market: public goods, being without private cost, should earn no private return. Alternative explanations of this anomaly are considered. The most likely explanation is that earnings variables proxy for omitted variables or other misspecification effects in the two-parameter model: that the measured market portfolio is not mean-variance efficient. Similar anomalies and explanations apply to other ‘yield-surrogates’, including dividend yields and Value Line ratings.

## 4. Systematic ‘abnormal’ returns after quarterly earnings announcements
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- Ross L. Watts
### Abstract
Numerous studies observe abnormal returns after the announcement of quarterly earnings. Ball (1978) suggests those returns are not evidence of market inefficiency, but instead are due to deficiencies in the capital asset-pricing model. This paper tests whether abnormal returns are observed when steps are taken to reduce the effect of deficiencies in the capital asset-pricing model. Significant abnormal returns are observed, but do not cover the transactions costs unless one can avoid direct transactions costs (e.g., a broker). The paper also investigates whether those abnormal returns can be attributed to a deficiency in the capital asset-pricing model. The conclusion is they cannot.

## 5. The information content of discounts and premiums on closed-end fund shares
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- Rex Thompson
### Abstract
This paper investigates the extent to which discounts and premiums provide information about future expected rates of return on closed-end investment company shares. It is found that discounted fund shares, adjusted for risk, tended to outperform the market in the period 1940 to 1975. Funds selling at a premium appear to have been bad investments over the same time period. On the basis of these results it is argued that the two-parameter capital asset pricing model does not describe the return generating process of closed-end funds. Other potential areas to search for breakdowns in two-parameter pricing are suggested.

## 6. Empirical tests of boundary conditions for CBOE options
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- Dan Galai
### Abstract
In this paper the lower boundary conditions for traded options are derived and subjected to empirical testing. Two hypotheses are formulated based on the theoretical conditions and tested on data on call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The first hypothesis argues that the stock and options markets are well synchronized so that simultaneous closing prices are within the theoretical boundaries. The evidence in the ex post test is inconsistent with this hypothesis. The second hypothesis claims the markets to be efficient. The tests are directed toward the question whether arbitrage profits could actually have been made on the Exchange by exploiting the violations of the dominance condition. The tests, carried out as ex ante tests, indicate that positive profits could have been exploited on the average, but the magnitude of the average was small relative to the dispersion of the yields.

## 7. The information content of option prices and a test of market efficiency
### Date

### Abstract
The Black-Scholes option pricing model, as generalized for dividend payments by Merton, is used to calculate implied variances of future stock returns. These variances are found to be better predictors of future stock return variances than those obtained from historic stock price data. A trading strategy is developed that exploits the informational content of the implied variances. The trading strategy, contrary to the efficient market hypothesis, produces abnormally high returns.

## 8. The market valuation of cash dividends
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- John B. Long
### Abstract
Since early 1956 Citizens Utilities Company has had two classes of common stock which are virtually identical in all respects except dividend payout. One class pays only stock dividends, the other class pays only cash dividends, and the corporate charter requires that the dividends per share on the two classes be of equivalent value. Under an I.R.S. ruling granted to Citizens Utilities in 1955 and a ‘grandfather clause’ in the 1969 Tax Reform Act, the stock dividends are not taxable as ordinary income. (No other publicly held firm has such a ruling and, in general, the 1969 Act made stock dividends of this type taxable.) Given these circumstances, the price-dividend history of the Citizens Utilities shares provides a view of the effects of alternative payout policies which, to an exceptional degree, is free of confounding factors. Close examination of this history implies that, if anything, claims to cash dividends have commanded a slight premium in the market over claims to equal amounts (before taxes) of capital gains.

## 9. Split information, stock returns and market efficiency-I
### Date
- Jun 1978
### Author
- Guy Charest
### Abstract
This is the first part of a study about common stock returns around split events (part I) and dividend change events (part II) as revealed in the 1947–1967 experience of the New York Stock Exchange. Competing estimates of abnormal returns (residuals) are obtained and compared. Trading rules, involving fixed and variable monthly investments, are tested for profitability. Trading triggered by split proposals, dividend increases and, in particular, dividend decreases yields significant residuals and would thus point to market inefficiencies. Some drifting in the samples' average risk and residual behavior is explained in terms of risk measurement and two-factor market model characteristics. Residuals hardly change when risk adjustment is based on variance of returns in lieu of beta. The question is raised that the residual approach may at times prove unduly refined. Yet a multi-method approach to risk-return studies seems advisable because the odd behavior found one way can often be fruitfully explained or confirmed through comparisons with results obtained another way. In part I below outstanding features are: (1) the stocks' average excess returns in the three months following split proposals differ from zero but the anomaly hinges on the results for a rather short time sub-period; (2) numerous pitfalls in measuring and interpreting stocks' residuals are brought into light. Part II is the subject of a companion article in this issue of the Journal.

## 10. Dividend information, stock returns and market efficiency-II
### Date
- Jun 1978

### Abstract
This is the second part of a study about common stock returns around split events (Part I) and dividend change events (Part II) as revealed in the 1947–1967 experience of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Part I is the subject of a companion article in this issue of the Journal. The evidence about splitting stocks was found in many ways consistent with the efficient capital markets hypothesis, slightly method-dependent and time-dependent to an appreciable degree. By contrast, the results from Part II presented below point to persistent inefficiencies in the market. In almost any way one looks at the stocks' residuals in the months following the selected dividend changes, decreases in particular, they turn out abnormally large. The interpretation is advanced that, on the average, the NYSE under-reacts when dividend changes are announced. The possibility is also recognized that unexplored basic problems with the residual approach could account for the abnormal results.
