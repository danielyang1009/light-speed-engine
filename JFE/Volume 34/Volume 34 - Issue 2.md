## 2. Underwriter price support and the IPO underpricing puzzle
### Date
- Oct 1993
### Authors

### Abstract
This paper reassesses the apparent systematic underpricing of initial public offerings (IPOs). Investigation of the distribution of initial returns following IPOs shows that positive mean initial returns may reflect the existence of a partially unobserved left (negative) tail. Moreover, most IPOs with zero one-day returns subsequently fall in price, suggesting that underwriter price support may account for the skewed distribution and hence the phenomenon of positive average initial IPO returns, even if offering prices are set at expected market value. This paper thus challenges the presumption underlying previous research that positive average initial IPO returns result primarily from deliberate underpricing.

## 3. An empirical investigation of IPO returns and subsequent equity offerings

### Abstract
Several recent papers present signaling models in which firms underprice their initial public offerings of equity (IPOs) so that they can subsequently issue seasoned equity at more favorable prices. We test the implications of these models. We find a positive relation between IPO underpricing and the probability and size of subsequent seasoned offerings. Although these results are consistent with the implications of the signaling hypotheses, the economic significance appears weak. We conduct additional tests to evaluate other explanations for these findings and find the alternatives more compelling.

## 4. Price stabilization in the market for new issues

### Abstract
This study examines price stabilization in new equity issues. Stabilizationtruncates the distribution of post-issue prices at a floor price, lowering the risk of adverse price moves and hence, in a competitive dealer market, reducing the bid-ask spread. Using 1.523 NASDAO-traded firm- commitment initial public offerings issued between 1982 and 1987, we find that spreads narrow when the market price is close to the offer price and stabilization is most likely. Moreover, significant negative returns are documented after the hypothesized termination of stabilizing activities, suggesting that stabilization, and its cessation, affect market prices.

## 5. Unit initial public offerings
### Date
- Oct 1993
### Authors
- Paul Schultz
### Abstract
Units are bundles of common stock and warrants. By selling initial public offerings (IPOs) of units, firms precommit to sell more stock in the future at the warrant's exercise price. Sequential offerings of this type reduce the agency costs of giving management a potential free cash flow at the IPO. Consistent with this theory, firms that choose unit IPOs are smaller, have less income and assets in relation to their IPO proceeds, and are less likely to survive than firms that issue shares.

## 6. The underpricing of initial public offerings and the partial adjustment phenomenon
### Date
- Oct 1993
### Authors
- Kathleen Weiss Hanley
### Abstract
This paper documents that the relation of the final offer price to the range of anticipated offer prices disclosed in the preliminary prospectus is a good predictor of initial returns. Issues that have final offer prices which exceed the limits of the offer range have greater underpricing than all other initial public offerings, and are also more likely to increase the number of shares issued. These results are consistent with the pricing and allocation schedule proposed by Benveniste and Spindt (1989), in which shares in an offering are rationed and prices only partially adjust to new information.

## 7. The winner's curse, legal liability, and the long-run price performance of initial public offerings in Finland
### Date
- Oct 1993
### Authors
- Matti Keloharju
### Abstract
Rationing data for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Finnish market make possible a test of Rock's (1986) winner's curse hypothesis. The evidence from 80 IPOs issued between 1984 and 1989 confirms the presence of the winner's curse: average returns adjusted for the bias in allocation are lower than average unadjusted returns. But the initial returns of these IPOs appear unrelated to lawsuit avoidance, as the sample firms seem unlikely to incur legal liabilities. In the long run, consistent with the evidence in the United States, the IPO firms substantially underperform the Helsinki Stock Exchange value-weighted index.
