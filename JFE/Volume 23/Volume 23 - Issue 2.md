## 2. A nonlinear general equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors
- Francis A. Longstaff
### Abstract
We derive and test an alternative closed-form general equilibrium model of the term structure within the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross theoretical framework in which yields are nonlinear functions of the risk-free rate. We show that equilibrium bond prices and the risk-free rate are not always inversely related and that bond risk need not be strictly increasing in maturity. Using Hansen's generalized method of moments to obtain parameter estimates, this nonlinear model outperforms the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross square root model in describing actual Treasury bill yields for the 1964–1986 period.

## 3. Shareholder wealth effects of corporate takeovers
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors
- Julian R. Franks
- Robert S. Harris
### Abstract
This paper examines the effects of over 1,800 U.K. takeovers on shareholder wealth in the period 1955–1985. It shows that around the merger announcement date targets gain 25 to 30 percent and bidders earn zero or modest gains. The U.K. data allow independent tests of many issues addressed in studies of U.S. takeovers. Target gains are higher in the U.K. after 1968, suggesting that increases in U.S. target gains at the same time may not be attributable to the Williams Act. Postmerger share-price performance suggests that acquisitions follow favorable developments in bidder's equity prices.

## 4. A direct test of Rock's model of the pricing of unseasoned issues
### Date

### Authors

### Abstract
Unique data availability and institutional arrangements for new issues in Singapore allow a direct test of the empirical implications of Rock's model of pricing unseasoned new issues. Our empirical results are consistent with the model. Specifically we find that the unseasoned new issues' anomaly disappears when the rationing associated with new issues is incorporated into the analysis. The winner's curse is evident in allocation patterns used in Singapore.

## 5. Voluntary conversion of convertible securities and the optimal call strategy
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors

- Kenneth M. Eades
### Abstract
We provide an explanation of why convertibles are called long after the conversion value exceeds the call price. Delaying the call benefits the firm if enough investors are expected to delay their voluntary conversions. Consistent with this theory, we document that a substantial number of investors do not voluntarily convert when the common dividend exceeds the convertible's dividend plus its premium over conversion value. We find that firms would not have increased common stock returns by switching to the strategy of calling to force conversion as soon as possible. Surprisingly, we find that convertible preferreds frequently sell below conversion value.

## 6. Signalling by underpricing in the IPO market
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors
- Franklin Allen
- Gerald R. Faulhaber
### Abstract
Empirical evidence suggests the existence of ‘hot-issue’ markets for initial public offerings: in certain periods and in certain industries, new issues are underpriced and rationing occurs. This paper develops a model consistent with this observation, which assumes the firm itself best knows its prospects. In certain circumstances, firms with the most favorable prospects find it optimal to signal their type by underpricing their initial issue of shares, and investors know that only the best can recoup the cost of this signal from subsequent issues.

## 7. A critique of latent variable tests of asset pricing models
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors
- Simon M. Wheatley
### Abstract
Latent variable tests of asset pricing models make assumptions about the joint distribution of observable returns and unobservable benchmark returns. These tests can falsely accept models when a mean-variance efficient portfolio other than the benchmark satisfies the distributional assumptions imposed on the benchmark portfolio. Also, because the assumptions are untestable, there is no way to discover whether a model is being rejected because the assumptions are false. Without these assumptions, however, latent variable tests can be viewed only as tests of distributional hypotheses about mean-variance efficient portfolios of unknown composition.

## 8. Trader rationality in the exercise of futures options
### Date

### Authors

- Robert W Kolb
- Kenneth Yung
### Abstract
We examine the rationality of investor exercise behavior by analyzing two years' tendered exercise notices for Treasury bond futures options. We conclude that exercise behavior is generally rational, but document numerous failures to exercise as well as some exercises that should not have occured, both at and prior to expiration. The most frequent type of error is failing to exercise, suggesting that traders do not monitor their positions with sufficient care. Finally, we show that investors use information arriving after trading closes, but before exchange-imposed exercise deadlines, in forming their exercise decisions.

## 9. The behavior of prices in the Nikkei spot and futures market
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors

### Abstract
We examine the relation between the prices of Japanese stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as reflected in the Nikkei Stock Average (NSA) stock index and the prices of the NSA futures contract traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). Since the inception of trading in September 1986, the NSA futures contract has generally sold at a discount relative to its theoretical value. Trading restrictions and transaction costs may explain some of this mispricing, which has been declining over time, as in the U.S. markets.

## 10. A nonparametric test for abnormal security-price performance in event studies
### Date
- Aug 1989
### Authors
- Charles J Corrado
### Abstract
This paper evaluates a new nonparametric rank test for abnormal security-price performance in event studies. Simulations with daily security-return data show that the rank test is better specified under the null hypothesis and more powerful under the alternative hypothesis than the parametric t-test. Unlike previous nonparametric tests, this rank test does not require symmetry in cross-sectional excess returns distributions for correct specification.
