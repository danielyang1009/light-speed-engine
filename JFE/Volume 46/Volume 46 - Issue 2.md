### Abstract
The extent to which banking firms face external financing costs when funding new loans has important implications for the role of banks in the corporate capital acquisition process, for the effectiveness of monetary policy and for the impact of capital requirements. We investigate this issue by examining the cash-flow sensitivity of loan growth at bank holding companies, and by examining the extent to which holding companies establish an internal capital market to allocate capital among their various subsidiaries. Overall, we find that loan growth at subsidiary banks is more sensitive to the holding company's cash flow and capital position than to the bank's own cash flow and capital. Moreover, we find that bank loan growth is negatively correlated with loan growth among the other subsidiaries within the holding company. Overall, this evidence suggests that bank holding companies establish internal capital markets to allocate scarce capital among their various subsidiaries.

## 3. CEO turnover and outside succession A cross-sectional analysis
### Date
- Nov 1997
### Authors
- Robert Parrino
### Abstract
This study examines chief executive officer (CEO) turnover. It reports new evidence on factors that affect the likelihoods of voluntary and forced turnover, and for both of these turnover types, whether the new CEO is from inside the firm, from another firm in the industry, or from outside the industry. The evidence is consistent with arguments that poor CEOs are easier to identify and less costly to replace in industries that consist of similar firms than in heterogeneous industries. The likelihoods of forced turnover and of an intra-industry appointment increase with industry homogeneity.

## 4. Do strategic alliances create value?

### Abstract
We investigate share price responses to the formation of 345 strategic alliances spanning 1983–1992. The average stock price response is positive, with no evidence of wealth transfers. This is true for horizontal alliances (involving partner firms in industries with the same three-digit SIC codes) as well as non-horizontal alliances. For horizontal alliances, more value accrues when the alliance involves the transfer or pooling of technical knowledge than with nontechnical alliances. Finally, partnering firms tend to display better operating performance than their industry peers over the five-year period surrounding the year in which an alliance is formed.

## 5. Why underwrite rights offerings? Some new evidence
### Date

### Abstract
We examine rights issues on the Oslo Stock Exchange, where seasoned public offerings now take place almost exclusively through use of the relatively expensive standby underwriting method rather than unsinsured rights. We show that the propensity to use standby underwriting increases as expected shareholder takeup decreases, that the market reaction to uninsured rights offers is significantly positive, and that standbys elicit the least favorable market reaction to the public issue announcement. These and other cross-sectional results are consistent with the asymmetric information framework of Eckbo and Masulis (1992) and help resolve the longstanding rights offer paradox.
