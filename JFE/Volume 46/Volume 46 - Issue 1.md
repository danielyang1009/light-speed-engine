## 3. Why is there a home bias? An analysis of foreign portfolio equity ownership in Japan

### Abstract
This paper studies stock ownership in Japanese firms by non-Japanese investors from 1975 to 1991. Existing models predicting that foreign investors hold national market portfolios or portfolios tilted towards stocks with high expected returns are inconsistent with our evidence. We document that foreign investors hold disproportionately more shares of firms in manufacturing industries, large firms, and firms with good accounting performance, low unsystematic risk, and low leverage. Controlling for size, there is evidence that small firms that export more firms with greater share turnover, and firms that have ADRs have greater foreign ownership.

## 4. Corporate restructuring during performance declines in Japan

### Abstract
This paper documents the restructuring of 92 Japanese corporations that experienced a substantial decline in operating performance between 1986 and 1990. These firms implement a number of downsizing measures such as asset sales, plant closures, and employee layoffs. Firms also expand and diversify, and often restructure their internal operations. Compared to US firms with a similar decline in performance, however, Japanese firms are less likely to downsize, and layoffs affect a smaller fraction of their workforce. The frequency of asset downsizing and layoffs in Japanese firms increases with the ownership by the firm's main bank and other blockholders. Blockholders also increase the probability of management turnover, outside director removals and outside director additions, but decrease the likelihood of acquisitions. We document improvements in operating performance following downsizing actions in Japan.

## 5. Negative option values are possible: The impact of Treasury bond futures on the cash U.S. Treasury market

### Abstract
This paper uses a unique financial instrument in the U.S. Treasury market to study the price behavior of the put option embedded in the November 2009 14 callable U.S. Treasury bond. We find that, beginning in August 1993, the estimated option value was persistently negative on nearly every day for the ensuing eight months. We show that the anomalous pricing behavior arose because the underlying callable bond became the cheapest to deliver issue against U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts. Hence, this paper provides direct evidence that derivative assets can significantly distort pricing in the primary asset market.

## 6. Return autocorrelation and institutional investors

### Abstract
We propose and test the hypothesis that trading by institutional investors contributes to serial correlation in daily returns. Our results demonstrate that NYSE particles and individual security daily return autocorrelationsare an increasing function of the level of institutional ownership. Moreover, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that institutional trading reflects information and increases the speed of price adjustment. The relation between autocorrelation and institutional holdings does not, however, apparent to be driven by market frictions or rational time-varying required rates of return. We conclude that institutional investors correlated trading patterns contribute to axial correlation in daily returns.
