## 2. Transactions costs and investment style: an inter-exchange analysis of institutional equity trades

### Abstract
This paper examines the magnitude and determinants of transactions costs for a sample of institutional traders with different investment styles. Using order-level data for recent equity transactions totaling $83 billion, we find that trading costs are economically significant and increase with trade difficulty. In addition, costs vary with traderspecific factors such as investment style and order submission strategy, as well as stock-specific factors such as exchange listing. We find evidence that institutional trades in exchange-listed stocks have lower costs than in comparable Nasdaq stocks.

## 3. A cross-exchange comparison of execution costs and information flow for NYSE-listed stocks

### Abstract
We examine execution costs for trades in NYSE issues completed on the NYSE, the NASD dealer market, and the regional stock exchanges during 1994. We find that effective bid-ask spreads are only slightly smaller at the NYSE. However, realized bid-ask spreads, which measure market-making revenue net of losses to betterinformed traders but gross of inventory or order-processing costs, are lower on the NYSE by a factor of two to three. This differential is attributable to the successful ‘cream skimming’ of uninformed trades by off-NYSE market makers. These findings reinforce existing concerns about whether orders are routed so as to receive the best possible execution.

## 4. Board structure and fee-setting in the U.S. mutual fund industry
### Date

### Abstract
This study uses a new database to describe the composition and compensation of boards of directors of U.S. open-end mutual funds. We use these data to examine the relation between board structure and the fees charged by a fund to its shareholders. We find that shareholder fees are lower when fund boards are smaller, have a greater fraction of independent directors, and are composed of directors who sit on a large fraction of the fund sponsor's other boards. We find some evidence that funds whose independent directors are paid relatively higher directors' fees approve higher shareholder fees.

## 5. A multibeta representation theorem for linear asset pricing theories
### Date
- Dec 1997
### Authors
- Sanjay K. Nawalkha
### Abstract
This paper derives a multibeta representation theorem for pricing assets using arbitrary reference variables that are not necessarily the true factors. Under this theorem, the upper bound on pricing deviations depends upon the correlations not only between the reference variables and the factors but also between the reference variables and the residual risks. A new concept of a well-diversified variable is introduced, which though free of residual risk, may be less than perfectly correlated with the true factors. Welldiversified variables correlated with the factors play a key role in the pricing of assets, since these variables can replace the factors without any loss in pricing accuracy under all linear asset pricing theories.

## 6. Bounds on contingent claims based on several assets

### Abstract
In 1987, Lo derived an upper bound on the price of a European call option on a single asset. Lo's bound depends only on the mean and variance of the terminal asset price and is termed a semi-parametric bound. This paper derives similar semi-parametric bounds on a European call on the maximum of any number of assets. A distribution-free bound for the price of this option is obtained. The bound depends only on the means and covariance matrix of the returns on n underlying assets. The bound is obtained by optimizing over the entries of a positive definite matrix A. This can be accomplished by a technique known as semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the methodology using two specific applications. The first concerns the valuation of a European call option on the maximum of several assets. This is known as an outperformance option and is of some practical interest. The second application concerns the valuation of a discretely adjusted lookback option. These lookback options are of interest in connection with certain equity annuity insurance products.
