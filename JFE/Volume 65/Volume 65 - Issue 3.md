## 2. Litigation risk and IPO underpricing

### Abstract
We examine the relation between risk and IPO underpricing and test two aspects of the litigation-risk hypothesis: (1) firms with higher litigation risk underprice their IPOs by a greater amount as a form of insurance (insurance effect) and (2) higher underpricing lowers expected litigation costs (deterrence effect). To adjust for the endogeneity bias in previous studies, we use a simultaneous equation framework. Evidence provides support for both aspects of the litigation-risk hypothesis.

## 3. Funding growth in bank-based and market-based financial systems: evidence from firm-level data

### Abstract
We investigate whether firms’ access to external financing to fund growth differs in market-based and bank-based financial systems. Using firm-level data for 40 countries, we compute the proportion of firms in each country relying on external finance and examine how that proportion differs across financial systems. We find that the development of a country's legal system predicts access to external finance, and stock markets and the banking system affect access to external finance differently. However, we find no evidence that firms’ access to external financing is predicted by several proxies for relative development of stock markets to the development of the banking system.

## 4. The ultimate ownership of Western European corporations

### Abstract
We analyze the ultimate ownership and control of 5,232 corporations in 13 Western European countries. Typically firms are widely held (36.93%) or family controlled (44.29%). Widely held firms are more important in the UK and Ireland, family controlled firms in continental Europe. Financial and large firms are more likely widely held, while non-financial and small firms are more likely family controlled. State control is important for larger firms in certain countries. Dual class shares and pyramids enhance the control of the largest shareholders, but overall there are significant discrepancies between ownership and control in only a few countries.

## 5. Predicting the next step of a random walk: experimental evidence of regime-shifting beliefs

### Abstract
Barberis et al. (J. Financial Econ. 49 (1998) 307), construct a model in which investors use the prevalence of past trend reversals as an indicator of the likelihood of future reversals. While such “regime-shifting” beliefs are consistent with a variety of psychological theories, other contrary predictions are consistent with the same theories. We report two experiments with MBA-student participants that strongly support the existence of regime-shifting beliefs. We conclude that regime-shifting models can provide a useful framework for understanding market anomalies, including underreactions to earnings changes and overreactions to long-term earnings trends.

## 6. Market efficiency in real time

### Abstract
The Morning Call and Midday Call segments on CNBC TV provide a unique opportunity to study the efficient market hypothesis. The segments report analysts’ views about individual stocks and are broadcast when the market is open. We find that prices respond to reports within seconds of initial mention, with positive reports fully incorporated within one minute. Trading intensity doubles in the first minute, with a significant increase in buyer- (seller-) initiated trades after positive (negative) reports. Traders who execute within 15 seconds of the initial mention make small but significant profits by trading on positive reports during the Midday Call.
