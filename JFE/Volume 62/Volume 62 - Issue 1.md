### Abstract
This paper investigates the effect of interest rate correlation in pricing and exercise of Bermudan swaptions. Investigating both Gaussian Markov models and Libor market models, we find that Bermudan swaption prices change only moderately (and in fact typically decrease slightly) when the number of factors in the underlying interest rate model is increased from one to two. We explain the rationale behind these results, and also demonstrate that exercise information generated within a best-fit one-factor model only leads to insignificant losses when properly applied in a two-factor model. Our results provide support for the standard Wall Street practice of using continuously re-calibrated one-factor models to price Bermudan swaptions, as long as calibration procedures are sufficiently comprehensive.

## 2. Throwing away a billion dollars: the cost of suboptimal exercise strategies in the swaptions market

### Abstract
This paper studies the costs of applying single-factor exercise strategies to American swap options when the term structure is actually driven by multiple factors. Using a multifactor string market model of the term structure, we find that even when single-factor models are recalibrated to match the market at every exercise date, the exercise strategies they imply can be suboptimal. Based on estimates of notional amounts outstanding, the total present value costs of following single-factor strategies could be several billion dollars. These results illustrate the importance of using well-specified term structure models.

## 3. Portfolio choice and equity characteristics: characterizing the hedging demands induced by return predictability
### Date

### Abstract
This paper examines portfolio allocation across equity portfolios formed on the basis of characteristics like size and book-to-market. In particular, the paper assesses the impact of return predictability on portfolio choice for a multi-period investor with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 4. Compared to the investor's allocation in her last period, return predictability with dividend yield causes the investor early in life to tilt her risky-asset portfolio away from high book-to-market stocks and away from small stocks. These results are explained using Merton's (Econometrica 41 (1973) 867) characterization of portfolio allocation by a multi-period investor in a continuous time setting. Abnormal returns relative to the investor's optimal early life portfolio are also calculated. These abnormal returns are found to exhibit the same cross-sectional patterns as abnormal returns calculated relative to the market portfolio: higher for small rather than large firms, and higher for high rather than low book-to-market firms. Thus, hedging demand may be a partial explanation for the high expected returns documented for small firms and high book-to-market firms. However, even with this hedging demand, the investor wants to sell short the low book-to market portfolio to hold the high book-to-market portfolio. The utility costs of using a value-weighted equity index or of ignoring predictability are also calculated. An investor using a value-weighted equity index would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to book-to-market portfolio than size portfolios. Finally, an investor would give up a much larger fraction of her wealth to have access to dividend yield information than term spread information.

## 4. Pricing and hedging in incomplete markets

### Abstract
We present a new approach for positioning, pricing, and hedging in incomplete markets that bridges standard arbitrage pricing and expected utility maximization. Our approach for determining whether an investor should undertake a particular position involves specifying a set of probability measures and associated floors which expected payoffs must exceed in order for the investor to consider the hedged and financed investment to be acceptable. By assuming that the liquid assets are priced so that each portfolio of assets has negative expected return under at least one measure, we derive a counterpart to the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing. We also derive a counterpart to the second fundamental theorem, which leads to unique derivative security pricing and hedging even though markets are incomplete. For products that are not spanned by the liquid assets of the economy, we show how our methodology provides more realistic bidâ€“ask spreads.

## 5. The optimal spread and offering price for underwritten securities
### Date
- Oct 2001
### Author
- John C. Yeoman
### Abstract
The paper develops the net proceeds maximization theory explaining how the spread and offering price are determined in all underwritten offerings in the U.S. The theory yields solutions for the optimal spread and offering price for all underwritten securities and it yields comparative statics that explain the cross-sectional variation in actual spreads and initial returns across different types of underwritten securities. The theory also suggests two alternative explanations to the ones offered by Chen and Ritter (J. Finance 55 (2000) 1105) for the clustering of unseasoned equity offerings spreads at 7%.
