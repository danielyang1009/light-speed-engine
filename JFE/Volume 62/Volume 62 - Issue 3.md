### Abstract
We investigate the trade-off between the benefits from bank monitoring when a banker is represented on a firm's board and the costs from two sources: conflicts of interests between lenders and shareholders, and U.S. legal doctrines that generate lender liability for bankers on boards of firms in financial distress. Consistent with high costs of active involvement, bankers are on boards of large, stable firms with high proportions of collateralizable assets and low reliance on short-term financing. While permitting banks to own equity could mitigate conflicts, the protection of shareholder versus creditor rights could continue to reduce the role of U.S. banks in corporate governance.

## 2. Pay for performance? Government regulation and the structure of compensation contracts

### Abstract
In 1992–1993, the SEC required enhanced disclosure on executive compensation and Congress enacted tax legislation limiting the deductibility of non-performance related compensation over one million dollars, i.e. Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). We examine the effects of these regulatory changes and report small and large sample evidence that many million-dollar firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m) and that salary growth rates have declined post-1993 for the firms most likely to be affected by the regulations. We further document that bonus and total compensation payouts are increasingly sensitive to stock returns after 1993, especially for firms with million-dollar pay packages. We also document that, once we control for other factors affecting CEO incentives, the sensitivity of the CEO's wealth to changes in shareholder wealth has increased from 1993 to 1996 for firms with CEOs near or above the million dollar compensation level. Overall, our results suggest that some firms have reduced salaries in response to 162(m). More importantly, the pay for performance sensitivity, measured using total annual compensation and firm-related CEO wealth, has increased for firms likely to be affected by 162(m).

## 3. Linking pay to performance—compensation proposals in the S&P 500

### Abstract
We study the proposal of manager-sponsored compensation plans linking pay to performance by S&P 500 firms in the 1990s. We examine the market perception of these proposals and the characteristics of the firms that propose them. Shareholders gain at the announcement of the plans, especially when the plans are directed toward the firm's top executives. Proposing firms are those that can most benefit from the plans, given their asset type and agency considerations. Firms with more potential agency costs have the highest vote-for percentages for the plans. However, shareholders are less approving of plans with negative features such as high dilution levels. Our work suggests that stock-based compensation plans are helpful in improving managerial efforts to increase shareholder wealth.

## 4. Does Delaware law improve firm value?
### Date
- Dec 2001
### Author
- Robert Daines
### Abstract
I present evidence consistent with the theory that Delaware corporate law improves firm value and facilitates the sale of public firms. Using Tobin's Q as an estimate of firm value, I find that Delaware firms are worth significantly more than similar firms incorporated elsewhere. The result is robust to controls for firm size, diversification, profitability, investment opportunity, industry, managerial ownership, and unobservable firm heterogeneity. Delaware firms are also significantly more likely to receive takeover bids and be acquired. Results are robust to controls for endogeneity.

## 5. Understanding the determinants of managerial ownership and the link between ownership and performance: comment
### Date

### Abstract
Himmelberg et al. (J. Financial Econom. 53 (1999) 353–384) argue that fixed effects estimators should be used in examination of the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance. I show that managerial ownership, while substantially different across firms, typically changes slowly from year to year within a company. With rational managers maximising long-term utility, small, one-year changes in ownership are not likely to reflect notable changes in incentives that would lead to substantive within-year changes in performance. By relying on within variation, fixed effects estimators may not detect an effect of ownership on performance even if one exists.
